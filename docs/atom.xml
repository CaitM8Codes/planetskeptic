<p class="lead">Here’s a novel definition of transgender people…although it’s not at all novel in the sense that it’s desperate flailing about trying to find an anatomical basis for discrimination. When all else fails, <a href="https://dnyuz.com/2022/10/07/this-politician-wants-transgender-to-be-defined-as-people-who-pee-with-one-hole/">invent a criterion</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pakistan’s progressive transgender laws are currently under attack. As legislators and clerics oppose the country’s Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act four years after it was passed, one senator wants to change how the measure defines transgender persons. Fawzia Arshad, a senator from Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) says transgender people should be defined as those who “keep one hole for urination.”</p>
<p>Arshad’s bill reflects a trend of escalating dissent and misinformation campaigns against the country’s transgender laws, in an effort to bring it in line with their understanding of Islamic teachings on gender and sex. While Arshad’s awkwardly-worded proposal has bemused many, making some wonder if she knows the difference between a vagina and a urethra, there’s also a larger concern over the direction this movement is taking.</p></blockquote>
<p>Confusing. By this definition, I am transgender. So is my wife. So is <em>everyone</em>, including Fawzia Arshad, unless she has an unfortunate medical condition. </p>
<p>Isn’t it terrible that the most ignorant people are also the most confident about their mistaken beliefs?</p>

    <title>They’re all liars</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/10/12/theyre-all-liars/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Last week, Elon Musk tweeted (you know, the usual forum for high-level diplomacy) a “peace plan” for Ukraine that was simply total surrender and concession to all of Putin’s demands and then some. Then it was revealed that Musk had had a recent phone call with Putin, which I could believe — he’s not a very bright guy, and simply parrots whatever the last person who spoke to him said. <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elon-musk-spoke-vladimir-putin-161315814.html">Now he denies the phone call</a>, and I can believe that, too. Musk is the kind of ego-driven guy who would claim to have inside info on the plans of powerful people.</p>
<blockquote><p>Elon Musk has denied the claim he spoke to Vladimir Putin before tweeting a peace plan for the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Tesla CEO’s peace suggestion included Ukrainian territory being handed over to Russia.</p>
<p>Eurasia Group subscribers were sent a report in which Ian Bremmer wrote that Mr Musk told him that the Russian president was “prepared to negotiate” if the Crimean peninsula remained in Russian hands, Vice reported.</p>
<p>Other conditions included that Ukraine retains permanent neutrality and that Ukraine recognises the Russian annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.</p>
<p>Mr Bremmer reports that Mr Musk said that Mr Putin told him that these targets would be reached “no matter what”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, I can shrug and believe he said things that have little basis in reality, because he is a glad-handing liar. Once you accept that, you can understand the motivation behind all the noise that comes out of his mouth.</p>
<p>I’ll also easily believe that Putin is a liar. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/12/baltics-poland-russia-warnings-nato/">The people who have the most experience with Russian neighborliness will tell you that</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Baltic leaders have long argued that Western sanctions adopted in 2014 after Putin illegally annexed Crimea showed the West’s lack of resolve in confronting the Russian president over his land grab. European leaders seemed to think the Baltics were so traumatized by Soviet occupation that they could not be objective.</p>
<p>“Jokingly, you know, we call this ‘West-splaining,’” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said. The West’s message, he said, was that “after 50 years of occupation, it’s understandable that you would have trust issues with a country that occupied you.”</p>
<p>“For us in the Baltics, it all boils down to this notion of appeasement: that basically we can appease Russia,” Landsbergis continued. “For us, it was always very clear, black and white. If a country is eager to cross another country’s border, they’re an aggressor and they will do that again, if they’re not stopped. And they have not been stopped.”</p>
<p>“That notion is quite pervasive, this notion of peaceful settlement with an aggressor,” he added. “I’m really hopeful that it’s now waning.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t trust imperialist countries. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>I think Central and South America are all clear on that, too.</p>

<p>Look, you’ll never persuade me with a tease that features the words “brand” and “influencer”. That’s a great way to get me running in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>I notice also that I am expected to cough up $4,000 to be mentioned in these “gift guides” from 20 different “influencers” who have almost certainly never even heard of me, while the “influencers” are getting paid. Seems a little unfair? I think I’ll pass.</p>

    <title>Time for a new renaissance?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6034/time-for-a-new-renaissance#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;img title="HowTheLightGetsIn festival aims to bring disciplines together, particularly philosophers and scientists" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/highres_84_6896-1-_1_.jpg" height="1278" alt="HowTheLightGetsIn London" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;You know the feeling. You pass the window of a book store, or switch on a political talk show, and are overwhelmed by an irritating sensation of deja vu. Haven&amp;rsquo;t you heard these ideas before? Behind the shiny new designs, aren&amp;rsquo;t these latest non-fiction hardbacks peddling the same basic theories, tweaked to entice a fresh audience? It can be difficult to gauge how our own personal frustration relates to the broader reality. On Sunday, HowTheLightGetsIn London confronted this perception head on. HTLGI is a festival dedicated to "big ideas", bringing together academics, scientists, creatives and "thought leaders" of all stripes. They have more than a vested interest, therefore, in answering the question. Is our intellectual climate in Britain stagnating? If so, how do we encourage new and original thinking?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The event brought together speakers from the diverse fields of philosophy, theoretical physics and journalism to chew over the dilemma. While the term &amp;ldquo;Renaissance Man&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t pass the lips of any of the speakers (although they might have updated it to &amp;ldquo;Renaissance person&amp;rdquo;), the figure of the free-thinking polymath was a definite spectre in the room. John Ellis, the renowned theoretical particle physicist, called for a more meaningful exchange of ideas and collaboration between disciplines. He pointed out that the experimental techniques he uses to test his ideas within the field of fundamental physics could fruitfully be applied to climate science. While it&amp;rsquo;s possible, he said, to get small pots of money for this kind of work, securing funding for such projects in the longer term is disappointingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;"Interdisciplinarity" is a term that is readily bandied about these days, but as the philosopher Sophie Scott-Brown remarked, we "need to pay more attention to what it actually means." She said this could be anything from bringing academics from different departments together to &amp;ldquo;sit around the same table&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;melting down the barriers&amp;rdquo; between disciplines. She is strongly in favour of the latter, envisioning a transformative shift towards a more creative, &amp;ldquo;inquiry-led&amp;rdquo; approach. Taking up John Ellis&amp;rsquo; point, dynamic and complex problems like the climate crisis, or the future of global security, could be tackled with the inventiveness required through putting more emphasis on bringing people together on the basis of what knowledge and skills they might bring to the challenge, whatever their field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But this isn't only a question of transforming our approach to learning and research. The trend towards specialisation is tightly linked today with the pressure on universities to adopt business practices and become increasingly self-sufficient, in the light of severe government cuts. The incentive to meet targets, the pressure to secure funding, and the fierce competition for students all serve to create an environment in which, in Scott-Brown's words, ideas are pumped out as "products". Meanwhile, the kind of open-ended inquiry that so often produces new discoveries is hampered by the need to justify the research in advance. &amp;ldquo;Most of my colleagues have to be 99 per cent sure about what they&amp;rsquo;re writing before putting forward a funding application.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;It's interesting that the most concrete idea came from the non-academic on the panel. The journalist David Aaronovitch made an impassioned plea to &amp;ldquo;abolish the A-level&amp;rdquo;, arguing that this would change the culture of learning that runs from school into universities. He claimed that every single British government had done a report on the A-level and found it to be wanting, but that there was a stubborn belief that specialisation is what makes the English system exceptional. He advocated switching to the International Baccalaureate (IB). The United States has the largest number of IB programmes, in both private and state schools, and he suggested that we take some lessons from the American approach, where university degrees are also four years, instead of three, and place more emphasis on students studying a wider breadth of subjects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Aaronovitch disagreed that our society is suffering from a lack of new big ideas, however. Following the two "isms" of the 20th century (communism and fascism), we now have a distrust of them which is perfectly healthy, he argued. We can see this plainly from the much more recent example of Prime Minister Truss&amp;rsquo; mini-budget, which is deeply &amp;ldquo;ideological&amp;rdquo; and has been a "failure". With big questions like how do we get to net zero, he said, "I'm happy to be more pragmatic."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Whether in pursuit of bold new theories, or working on practical solutions, there is hope when it comes to bringing people together. John Ellis praised the inclusion of more women and people of colour in the research community, and the way in which technology was creating a more level playing field when it came to participating in scientific debate. &amp;ldquo;And here I am,&amp;rdquo; he joked, &amp;ldquo;in a philosophy debate, while two other debates are going on about my own field of science.&amp;rdquo; HowTheLightGetsIn is one of the spaces where philosophers and scientists in particular benefit from coming together. &amp;ldquo;This is us forming the new society,&amp;rdquo; Scott-Brown said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But the festival happens twice a year, a drop in the ocean. For the spirit of a New Renaissance to take hold, changes would be needed on many levels: cultural, political and economic. It's certain that we need creativity and invention in order to meet the confluence of crises facing Britain today. While our current Prime Minister may indeed have outlined a consistent ideological position, her ideas are explicitly rooted in Thatcherism. It seems likely that a failure to generate new big ideas appropriate to the particular challenges Britain faces today will only lead to a dangerous re-hashing of the old. We know that our intellectual climate is fed by many sources, but the health of the academy, along with our education system as a whole, is surely the bedrock of the edifice. Interdisciplinarity will be key to renewal, but any transformation will need to start by treating universities not as businesses within the higher education market, but as spaces of learning, sharing and discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More details on HowTheLightGetsIn, the world's largest ideas and music festival, can be found &lt;a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/london"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those of you who couldn't be with us in person, all the debates and talks from the festival will gradually be released online in the coming months on the Institute of Art and Ideas online platform, &lt;a href="https://iai.tv/?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;amp;utm_campaign=London2022&amp;amp;utm_id=Partner"&gt;IAI.TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Originally published in Denmark in 1981, a small run of editions appeared in English translation two years later. It sought to present an affirming image of a child being raised by same-sex parents, featuring black and white photographs of Jenny (played by the author&amp;rsquo;s daughter) and her two dads happily going about their daily lives together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Produced with the best of intentions, &lt;em&gt;Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin&lt;/em&gt; disastrously failed to take account of cultural differences between England and Denmark, notably by including a picture of the family eating breakfast in bed where Eric and Martin are shirtless. Despite the fact that few had apparently seen, let alone read, a copy, the book and similar literature provoked a moral panic in this country, antagonising a range of ghoulish moral entrepreneurs and far-right journalists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;At the same time, Labour-led local authorities in some areas of London were attempting to introduce what would now be referred to as LGBT-inclusive education in schools, which brought them into fierce conflict with Margaret Thatcher&amp;rsquo;s government. In the shadow of the Aids crisis, the legislation which became known as Clause 28, and later Section 28, was passed into law in May 1988. Its supporters believed that they were protecting children from harm. Section 28 demanded that local authorities should not &amp;ldquo;intentionally promote homosexuality or promote the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.&amp;rdquo; It reached far beyond school classrooms, emboldening homophobic discrimination as well as fostering censorship and self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Paul Baker&amp;rsquo;s popular history, &lt;em&gt;Outrageous: The Story of Section 28 and Britain&amp;rsquo;s Battle for LGBT Education&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides a lucid and at times highly personal account of the rise and fall of Section 28, set against a backdrop of the turbulent moral and political conflicts of late 20th-century Britain. The book is at its best when narrating the popular resistance mobilised by the embattled LGBT community, ranging from mass public protests to pieces of audacious direct action. Oral history is used to relate two of the best known of these episodes, which &amp;ldquo;invaded&amp;rdquo; spaces at the heart of the establishment. In February 1988, members of &amp;ldquo;Lesbians against the Clause&amp;rdquo; evaded security and abseiled from the visitors&amp;rsquo; balcony in the House of Lords, disrupting the debate. The protestors (who in a nice touch, supplied the names of famous lesbians in history instead of their own) were arrested. The following month, another group of lesbian activists, frustrated at the way the media was covering stories about Clause 28, launched an incursion into a television studio, disrupting a live broadcast of the &lt;em&gt;Six O&amp;rsquo;Clock News&lt;/em&gt;. The ensuing scuffle generated the memorable headline &amp;ldquo;Beeb man sits on lesbian&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The latter part of the book covers the rocky road to the repeal of Section 28 in the early years of the 2000s; the fruit of sustained lobbying of LGBT advocacy organisations and activists. The delay in repeal &amp;ndash; six years from the election of Labour in 1997 &amp;ndash; demonstrates the difficulty in removing Section 28 in the face of resistant public opinion. There is brief coverage of the separate battle for repeal in Scotland in which a wealthy evangelical Christian businessman bankrolled a &amp;ldquo;referendum&amp;rdquo;. Accompanied by a spike in homophobic hate crime, it was claimed to show that a majority favoured keeping the legislation. However, mainstream politicians and the Electoral Reform Society cast doubt on the poll, and the associated &amp;ldquo;Keep the Clause&amp;rdquo; campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. This moment in Scottish history deserves its own in-depth account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;If there is a weakness to this book it is perhaps the failure to fully interrogate socially conservative ideology. Firstly, there might have been more consideration of the religious context of Section 28: the secularisation of English society since the 1960s, the declining power of Christian ideas about sexualities and the attempted counter-revolution by Christian moral conservatives in the 1980s. Notably, the pushback in this country failed to generate a religious revival similar to that witnessed in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Secondly, there is the murky issue of why vocal advocates of Section 28 in the 1980s seemed to genuinely believe that homosexuality was somehow to be equated with child abuse. Baker speculates that perhaps some of the members of the House of Lords who contributed to the debates had been &amp;ldquo;involved in coercive sexual experiences at boarding school which left them traumatised and confused&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but this theory only hints at one possible contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outrageous&lt;/em&gt; will not be the final word on the moral battles over sexual politics and regulation in late 20th-century Britain. It can be assumed that there was simply so much potential source material for this contemporary cultural history that plenty had to remain unsaid. What does make the cut is well chosen, and Baker&amp;rsquo;s writing style is capable of enlivening even the stodge of parliamentary debate. He has given us a witty, accessible and necessary book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The future of spycraft</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Interpreting a reconnaissance photo during the Cuban missile crisis, 1962" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/D990MF.jpg" height="773" alt="Interpreting a reconnaissance photo during the Cuban missile crisis" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In January 2022, US President Joe Biden declassified an extraordinary trove of intelligence to warn that Russia was about to invade Ukraine. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn&amp;rsquo;t believe him. Zelensky complained to reporters that the US was hyping the threat and hurting his economy. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the president of Ukraine, I&amp;rsquo;m based here and I think I know the details deeper than any other president,&amp;rdquo; he said. Within a month, 100,000 Russian troops attacked on three fronts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Zelensky has since become a heroic figure of courage and leadership. But he&amp;rsquo;s also human &amp;ndash; and his inability to see the invasion coming offers a powerful reminder of the challenges of intelligence analysis. Everyone knows, but we often forget, that predicting the future is hard. Experts loaded with data are often wrong. Doctors offer incorrect diagnoses and investors back the wrong companies. Intelligence is even harder, because data is scarce and adversaries are working hard to deceive. In foreign policy, the world out there is difficult to anticipate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s only part of the story. The other part &amp;ndash; which often gets overlooked &amp;ndash; is us: human brains are not wired to assess the future well. Psychology research finds that people rely on mental shortcuts to process the information bombarding them each day. These shortcuts are called cognitive biases. They enable faster thinking and efficient decision-making, like skimming Yelp reviews to pick a restaurant and voting on party-line tickets rather than carefully assessing each candidate for every local position. But cognitive biases are also prone to error, tricking our brains into thinking likely events are unlikely and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Certain biases have played an outsized role in intelligence, from China&amp;rsquo;s entry into the Korean War, and the Cuban missile crisis, to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq and Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness to believe Russia would invade. Events seem like surprises, even when they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Optimism bias and probabilities&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The most likely explanation for Zelensky&amp;rsquo;s dismissal of US intelligence warnings was that he didn&amp;rsquo;t want them to be true. He suffered from optimism bias, or a tendency to view information through the lens of wishful thinking. He&amp;rsquo;s got plenty of company. Optimism bias is everywhere. Researchers have found that people believe good events will happen to themselves more than others, that their own investments will outperform the average, that their favourite sports team has a higher chance of winning than it actually does. Optimism distorts the assessment of information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Politicians can be highly susceptible to proposals claiming favourable estimates of success, whether it&amp;rsquo;s humanitarian intervention in Somalia, war in Libya or renewed sanctions against Iran. The leaders of nearly every country involved in the First World War predicted a swift victory. &amp;ldquo;Give me 700,000 men and I will conquer Europe,&amp;rdquo; said General No&amp;euml;l de Castelnau, chief of staff for the French army at the outbreak of the war. Castelnau got 8.4 million men &amp;ndash; more than ten times the number he said he needed &amp;ndash; but Europe wasn&amp;rsquo;t conquered. It was decimated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Humans are not objective, no matter how hard we try to be. Researchers have found that people are wedded to their initial beliefs and will cling to them even in the face of contrary evidence. In Roman times, the imperial physician Galen was so confident in his remedies that no evidence could prove him wrong. He wrote, &amp;ldquo;All who drink of this treatment recover in a short time, except those whom it does not help, who all die. It is obvious, therefore, that it fails only in incurable cases.&amp;rdquo; Francis Bacon warned of the dangers of confirmation bias in 1620, writing, &amp;ldquo;The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion . . . draws all things else to support and agree with it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;We are also terrible with probabilities. Ever wonder why people are more afraid of dying in a shark attack than a car crash, even though fatal car accidents are about 60,000 times more likely? It&amp;rsquo;s not because people are stupid. The problem is availability bias: people naturally assume something they can easily recall is more likely to occur. Vivid, horrifying events (like shark attacks in the news) are generally easier to remember than everyday occurrences (like car accidents) even though they&amp;rsquo;re statistically less likely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;And intelligence analysts are human, like everyone else. We can see the powerful grip of recent experience in how different intelligence analysts viewed information about whether &amp;ldquo;the Pacer&amp;rdquo; walking around a suspicious Pakistani compound in 2011 was Osama bin Laden. Estimates about whether they had found the al-Qaeda leader ranged from 40 to 95 per cent. Those who had lived through the intelligence failure of overestimating Saddam&amp;rsquo;s WMD programs were more sceptical of the intelligence and issued lower probability estimates that the Pacer was bin Laden, while those coming off recent counterterrorism successes issued more optimistic assessments. What you predict depends on what you&amp;rsquo;ve experienced. It was only after US Navy Seals raided the compound that the evidence was in: they had found bin Laden after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p5"&gt;Thinking like the enemy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Good intelligence analysis also involves understanding how others think. Here, too, psychology research reveals why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to get inside the minds of others. One of the most challenging problems is called the fundamental attribution error, which is the tendency to believe that others behave badly because of their personality, while we behave badly because of factors beyond our control. Or put more simply, people often jump to blaming others while letting themselves off the hook. Drivers think that someone cutting them off must be a jerk, rather than wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s an emergency requiring them to drive that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In foreign policy crises, one country often overestimates the hostile motives of another, or underestimates how threatening its own actions could appear, or both. In the First Gulf War and the Iraq War, both the US and Iraq largely misunderstood the other&amp;rsquo;s view. Iraq underestimated the United States&amp;rsquo; risk tolerance following the Cold War and 9/11, and the US failed to see that Saddam was much more concerned about the Iranian threat than the American one. In both 1990 and 2003, an incomplete picture of the other side&amp;rsquo;s intentions and motives led to costly conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Trying to think like your adversary can backfire too, thanks to a process called mirror-imaging, which is the tendency to estimate how someone else will behave by projecting what you would do in the same situation. Framing your assessment with &amp;ldquo;If I were Xi Jinping,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;If I were a Russian intelligence officer&amp;rdquo; is one the greatest pitfalls in intelligence analysis and foreign policy decision making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The Cuban missile crisis of 1962 saw one of the most dangerous instances of mutual mirror-imaging, leading the world to the nuclear brink. American analysts failed to weigh the costs and benefits of a nuclear missile deployment to Cuba through Soviet eyes. And the Soviets appeared to make the same mistake when estimating how the US would react to its secret gambit. Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. called the Cuban missile crisis &amp;ldquo;the most dangerous moment in human history&amp;rdquo;. Why? Because each side believed the other thought like they did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Improving analysis to prevent nuclear catastrophe isn&amp;rsquo;t just a matter of history. Great power competition is back. Russia and China are trying to rewrite the international order along authoritarian lines. Their nuclear arsenals are expanding and modernising at alarming rates. And war is raging once again in the heart of Europe. Today, Nato is grappling with how it can help Ukraine defeat Russia without provoking World War III. The stakes are high, the policy challenges are complex, and intelligence analysis is pivotal to success. What have we learned about how humans think and how we can do better?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;After the Iraq WMD intelligence failure, the US Intelligence Community (IC) launched several initiatives to improve analysis. One was commissioning a study by academics from different fields to examine ideas in the social sciences and recommend ways for the IC to adopt them. I was one of the experts on the study, and I jumped at the chance. One of our recommendations was that the Intelligence Community needed to test its analytic methods in a rigorous way to see whether, how and why some approaches worked better than others. There are about 20,000 analysts in US intelligence agencies making thousands of estimates about geopolitical developments every year. And yet these agencies had never assessed which forecasts were right, which weren&amp;rsquo;t, and why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Inside the mind of a superforecaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Several intelligence officials ran with the idea of testing. They approached one of our panel members, Phil Tetlock, a leading scholar on expert judgment. Tetlock had recently finished a 20-year study examining how well experts forecasted the future. It was the first large-scale scientific experiment of judgment ever conducted. In it, Tetlock asked a group of nearly 300 experts to make thousands of predictions about economic and political issues of the day: nearly 82,000 predictions in all. His main finding was depressing. The average expert was about as accurate as a dart-throwing chimpanzee, and their predictions were about the same as random guessing. The chimpanzee discovery made headlines. Less noticed was Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s other finding: predicting the future wasn&amp;rsquo;t just lucky guessing. Some people did much, much better than average. He called them superforecasters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2011, the IC launched a forecasting tournament to explore what makes some people better forecasters than others. Over the next four years, five teams competed, answering questions every morning ranging from the price of oil at a given time to the prospects of conflict between China and Japan in the East China Sea. There were nearly 500 questions in all. The winner was the team with the best accuracy at predicting things that did not happen as well as things that did. Tetlock and his colleague Barbara Mellers put together a team of thousands of volunteers called the Good Judgment Project. The University of Michigan and MIT each fielded a team. The Intelligence Community did, too. The fifth team was a control group. &amp;ldquo;By varying the experimental conditions, we could gauge which factors improved foresight, by how much, over which time frames,&amp;rdquo; Tetlock later reflected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;By the end of the second year, the results were staggering: Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s volunteer team was winning by a lot. They outperformed other university-affiliated teams at Michigan and MIT by such large margins (30-70 per cent), the other schools were dropped from the competition. Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s team also beat professional intelligence analysts with access to classified data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The best of the best on Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s team, the superforecasters, weren&amp;rsquo;t geniuses with multiple PhDs. They were artists and scientists, students and retirees, &amp;ldquo;Wall Streeters and Main Streeters&amp;rdquo;, as Tetlock put it. Tetlock found that the secret to success wasn&amp;rsquo;t sky-high brilliance or a &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/em&gt;-like mastery of news and facts. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t what superforecasters knew. It was how they thought. Superforecasters are far more open-minded, curious, careful and self-critical than the average person. They believe that reality is complex, nothing is certain or inevitable, and that ideas should always be subjected to evidence, testing and updating. They have what Tetlock calls &amp;ldquo;Dragonfly eyes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the ability to see a problem with the 30,000 lenses of a dragonfly&amp;rsquo;s eye. While high-functioning groups harness the wisdom of different perspectives that each member brings, superforecasters can harness the wisdom of different perspectives from within, all by themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Perhaps most encouraging, Tetlock and his colleagues have since found in their experiments that superforecasting skills can be learned through training, practice, measurement and feedback. One basic 60-minute tutorial improved accuracy by ten per cent through a tournament year. That may not seem like a lot, but imagine if you had a ten per cent better chance of getting a promotion at work than all the other candidates, or your financial adviser could guarantee a ten per cent better return on your investments. When it comes to forecasting important things, ten per cent can be larger than you think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The future of intelligence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Humans are also getting help from machines. Advances in artificial intelligence offer potentially game-changing capabilities to process volumes of data at radically new speeds and scales, identify patterns across data sooner and more easily, and empower human analysts in new ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In 2020-21, I served on an expert task force that examined future intelligence challenges and opportunities arising from emerging technologies. The task force&amp;rsquo;s research included dozens of interviews and deep-dive sessions with technology leaders and intelligence experts across the US government, private sector and academia. We found that artificial intelligence (AI) and its associated technologies (such as cloud computing, advanced sensors and big data analytics) could transform every core intelligence mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;We also found that the greatest promise of AI comes from augmenting human analysts, not replacing them. By automating mundane tasks that absorb tremendous amounts of time, AI has the potential to free human analysts to concentrate on higher-level thinking that only humans can do well &amp;ndash; like assessing an adversary&amp;rsquo;s intentions, considering broader context, examining competing hypotheses and identifying what evidence may be missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Harnessing the power of AI to improve intelligence analysis won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. Even the most advanced AI algorithms have severe limitations, including the inability to explain how they reach results and the tendency to fail unexpectedly in the face of seemingly small changes &amp;ndash; like mistaking a picture of a sloth for a racing car when imperceptible changes are made to the image. AI also raises important ethical concerns. And adoption requires overcoming technical, bureaucratic and cultural hurdles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The future of intelligence analysis can be better than the past. Our greater knowledge of cognitive biases, combined with help from AI and training in superforecasting, offers tremendous promise. Notably, US intelligence agencies correctly anticipated Russia&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and issued public warnings, declassifying and sharing intelligence in real time to an unprecedented degree. The US Intelligence Community stuck by its assessment, even when Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s president doubted it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Physicist Richard Feynman once said that analysis is how we try not to fool ourselves. He&amp;rsquo;s right. Estimating the future will always be a hazardous occupation, especially in intelligence. The world outside is hard to predict, and the world inside our own minds is prone to error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But failure is not inevitable. Trying not to fool ourselves is a worthy endeavour, and evidence suggests we are likely to get better at it over time. We must continue to learn more about the processes and practices that make some individuals and groups more accurate than others, and embrace new technologies that enhance insight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an edited extract from Amy Zegart&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Spies, Lies and Algorithms&amp;rdquo; (Princeton University Press).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: The Slowworm’s Song</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6025/book-review-the-slowworms-song#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/slowworm.jpeg" height="500" alt="The Slowworm&amp;rsquo;s Song by Andrew Miller" width="313" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Slowworm&amp;rsquo;s Song (Sceptre) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;by Andrew Miller &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Stephen Rose, a former soldier who served in Northern Ireland and a recovering alcoholic, is haunted by his past. He lives a quiet life in Somerset, keeps his head down and works in a garden centre. Full of unspoken regret, he attempts to connect with Maggie, the adult daughter he barely knows, who lives in nearby Glastonbury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Slowworm&amp;rsquo;s Song&lt;/em&gt;, Andrew Miller&amp;rsquo;s ninth novel, is likely to win him further accolades. His 1997 debut &lt;em&gt;Ingenious Pain&lt;/em&gt; was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, while 2011&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Pure&lt;/em&gt; won the Costa Book of the Year award. Bristol-born Miller now lives with his daughter in Somerset, where his latest work is mainly set. Nodding to the book&amp;rsquo;s themes, Miller has dedicated it to his own daughter and father &amp;ndash; a Scotsman born in Belfast in 1925.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The book opens with a letter. Stephen&amp;rsquo;s fragile equilibrium is threatened when he is summoned to testify at an inquiry about an incident that took place in Northern Ireland in 1982. The letter is from Ambrose Carville, the &amp;ldquo;witness co-ordinator&amp;rdquo; of an organisation known as the Commission. Overwhelmed with anxiety, Stephen writes an account of his life as a record for his daughter. We learn of the early death of his mother and Stephen&amp;rsquo;s ill-fated decision, aged 19, to join the army, against his father&amp;rsquo;s Quaker beliefs. However, as Miller illustrates, Stephen&amp;rsquo;s prospects are limited. The army followed a brief spell at the local chicken processing plant. The grim environment is described in chilling detail: &amp;ldquo;In the killing rooms we dressed like trawler men expecting foul weather &amp;ndash; boots, waterproofs, sou&amp;rsquo;westers. Water or blood or both ran off every surface . . . A rotating blade cut their throats, though some of the birds, seeing what was coming, lifted their head clear at the last moment.&amp;rdquo; Several memories such as this are dropped into Stephen&amp;rsquo;s account and appear to be incidental &amp;ndash; but this is all part of Miller&amp;rsquo;s novelistic skill. Stephen merely escapes one world of violence for another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;After his tour of Northern Ireland ends in tragedy, Stephen&amp;rsquo;s army career is derailed. He eventually drifts to Bristol where he lives in a hippy squat, meets Evie and fathers a child. He is clearly traumatised but doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to confront his demons, so he buries them. On his release from a spell in prison, he discovers Evie has left with their daughter and his descent into alcoholism begins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Miller cut his teeth writing historical novels and this is clear in his depiction of army life in the early 1980s. Stephen&amp;rsquo;s training in Germany is well researched and portrayed, as is his regimented existence in Northern Ireland. He perfectly encapsulates Stephen&amp;rsquo;s frazzled nerves: &amp;ldquo;I was afraid I would drift apart, my limbs float off over the fields like zags of straw. By then, of course, I was full of strange imaginings. I was a house you would not want to visit. A house with an alarm going off in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The warzone of 1980s Belfast is interwoven with evocative depictions of rural Somerset. Miller lovingly details smalltown life and descriptions of the local Quaker meetings which promote silent reflection. The title of the book is taken from a lyric in Quaker poet Basil Bunting&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Briggflatts&lt;/em&gt;. A slowworm burrows and hides itself, and Bunting uses this image to suggest the freedom of quiet contemplation. For Stephen, the lyric recalls an untroubled period as a child, a moment of innocence with his father, a time when he was &amp;ldquo;not already ruined&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s surely no coincidence that &lt;em&gt;The Slowworm&amp;rsquo;s Song&lt;/em&gt; is published so close to the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Miller weaves a profound and poignant tale about shame, trauma and the possibility of redemption. At the heart of the novel is one man&amp;rsquo;s attempts to circumvent the wreckage of his life, which Miller conveys sympathetically and with deep psychological insight. He keeps us guessing as to Stephen&amp;rsquo;s fate until the book&amp;rsquo;s final pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Filming Kurt Vonnegut, the "Christ-loving atheist"</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6024/filming-kurt-vonnegut-the-christ-loving-atheist#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Still from the documentary " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/KURT-VONNEGUT_-UNSTUCK-IN-TIME-Still-1.jpg" height="711" alt="Still from 'Kurt Vonnegut: Unstuck in Time'" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;"When a person dies,&amp;rdquo; Kurt Vonnegut wrote in his 1969 masterwork &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;he only appears to die. He is very much alive in the past, present, and future, always has existed, always will exist.&amp;rdquo; Billy Pilgrim, the novel&amp;rsquo;s hero, learns this lesson on the planet Tralfamadore: &amp;ldquo;When a Tralfamadoran sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that person is just fine in plenty of other moments . . . Now, when I myself hear someone is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is &amp;lsquo;So it goes.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So it goes that Vonnegut isn&amp;rsquo;t dead. While his body may have expired in the year 2007, his books and ideas live on. And now his life has been captured in a new documentary, &lt;em&gt;Kurt Vonnegut: Unstuck in Time&lt;/em&gt;, currently streaming in the United States, the UK and Ireland. It&amp;rsquo;s been 40 years in the making, having started when Robert Weide &amp;ndash; now an Emmy award-winning director &amp;ndash; was 23 years old, and wrote to his literary idol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;That was back in 1982. Vonnegut responded and invited Weide to look him up the next time he was in New York. A friendship blossomed. Over the next 39 years, Weide would go on to direct the TV show &lt;em&gt;Curb Your Enthusiasm&lt;/em&gt;, as well as documentaries on some American comedians &amp;ndash; W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers. But it was only last year that the documentary on his literary idol finally hit the screens. It&amp;rsquo;s a deep dive into Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s life, his upbringing and creative output &amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s also about the friendship that the two men developed over nearly four decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Banned books and the Kurt Vonnegut museum&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Make friends. Welcome strangers. That&amp;rsquo;s what Kurt might say about the documentary. &amp;ldquo;We eventually starve,&amp;rdquo; Rodney Allen, a Vonnegut scholar and author of the book &lt;em&gt;Conversations with Kurt Vonnegut&lt;/em&gt;, says, &amp;ldquo;if we don&amp;rsquo;t feel love and don&amp;rsquo;t give love.&amp;rdquo; Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;love letters&amp;rdquo; were his books. In a career that spanned over 50 years, he published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays and five nonfiction works. Many of his books are still taught in schools in the United States, most notably &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt; and the lesser-known &lt;em&gt;Cat&amp;rsquo;s Cradle&lt;/em&gt;, a science-fiction satire that preys on the fear of witnessing Armageddon &amp;ndash; and worse, surviving it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that his work has always been popular. Many of his books were banned in his lifetime. &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt; has been objected to or removed from various schools a number of times. New York&amp;rsquo;s Island Trees School District, in a famous 1982 case, called it &amp;ldquo;anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy&amp;rdquo;. And the censorship hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone away. A school board in Republic, Missouri, decided to withdraw the book from its libraries in 2011.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;And yet, his spirit lives on. In his hometown of Indianapolis, the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library attracts visitors the world over. It houses such artefacts as his typewriter, reading glasses and his famous artwork &amp;ndash; often doodles of faces and stars &amp;ndash; loaned by the family. It also includes his Purple Heart, a US military decoration awarded to those wounded or killed while serving. Although Vonnegut may have laughed at the idea of anyone &amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo; from his life, the museum and library also offers classes, workshops and gathering spaces for the city. And when the libraries in Missouri withdrew &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five &lt;/em&gt;from their shelves, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library offered a free copy to all the students of the district.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;"We are doomed to be free"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;What message, if any, do we take away from the work and life of Kurt Vonnegut? The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; notes that he will &amp;ldquo;rightly be remembered as a darkly humorous social critic and premier novelist of the counterculture.&amp;rdquo; In 2015, he was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. But he has also been called, among other things, a &amp;ldquo;Christ-loving atheist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;He thought that nothing meant anything,&amp;rdquo; Allen says. &amp;ldquo;We are doomed to be free. It&amp;rsquo;s hard. He was for anything to give someone comfort.&amp;rdquo; That could mean watching movies with a box of hot buttered popcorn. It could mean walking the streets of Manhattan with your pals looking for a delicious sandwich. Or it could mean going to church.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Born in 1922, Kurt Vonnegut came from a long line of freethinkers. Clemens Vonnegut, his great-grandfather, helped found the Freethinker Society in Indianapolis in 1870, a rationalist organisation that attacked Biblical infallibility and advocated man&amp;rsquo;s moral freedom. Kurt majored in biochemistry at Cornell and considered himself a humanist. Later, he served for many years as the American Humanist Association&amp;rsquo;s honorary president. He observed that &amp;ldquo;being a humanist means trying to behave decently without expectation of rewards or punishments after you are dead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;His books, however, are soaked in Christian symbols and themes. Take, for instance, &lt;em&gt;Slapstick&lt;/em&gt;, where he invents a religion he calls &amp;ldquo;Church of Jesus Christ the Kidnapped&amp;rdquo;, founded on the principal that the Second Coming has already started, but that upon coming back to the world, Jesus was kidnapped by nefarious forces. Everyone in &lt;em&gt;Slapstick&lt;/em&gt; is looking for the kidnapped Christ, turning their heads every which way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As Chris Lafave, the curator of the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library, says of &lt;em&gt;Slapstick&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Vonnegut used religion as a somewhat sympathetic opiate for dealing with the pain of living. He did not want to be perceived as overly hostile to organised religion . . . nor do I think he wanted to be perceived as knowing all the answers.&amp;rdquo; Instead, he asked questions, and would laugh at the thought that there was some kind of &amp;ldquo;grand design&amp;rdquo; to life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;That laughter, raspy and cough-shortened because of all the cigarettes he smoked, reverberates throughout Weide&amp;rsquo;s documentary. Vonnegut liked a good joke. Life, itself, was a joke. And some punchlines hit hard. He famously survived the Second World War by hiding in a meat locker. An American prisoner of war in Nazi Germany, he hid there during the 1945 aerial bombing of Dresden that killed thousands of people &amp;ndash; a harrowing experience that helped give birth to &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt;. His war experiences form a large part of the documentary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;A lasting message of kindness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;"The world is sick with loneliness,&amp;rdquo; Edith Vonnegut says. &amp;ldquo;My dad believed in community. He longed for a tribe. He longed for primitive societies with relatives everywhere and everyone looking out for each other. Work on that &amp;ndash; the local level. You&amp;rsquo;ll find peace there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It seems like peace is hard to come by these days. America, the country Vonnegut fought for in the Second World War and wrote about extensively in his wild-dreamed books, is being pulled apart at the seams. When &lt;em&gt;Unstuck in Time&lt;/em&gt; was released in the US last year, police officers were on trial over another killing of a Black man. Anti-vaxxers were harassing medical workers. School boards were having roaring debates over wearing masks in schools. Meanwhile, climate change is real, yet no one really knows what to do about it. There&amp;rsquo;s gun violence and food insecurity. Social media is making us less social. And we are continuing to pull &amp;ldquo;contentious&amp;rdquo; books off the shelves of our libraries and schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So it goes that Vonnegut isn&amp;rsquo;t dead and we need him more than ever. Because Vonnegut tries to be kind, and tries still to be kind &amp;ndash; as someone, right now, pulls &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt; off a library shelf in Philadelphia; as someone, right now, sits with their spouse in their living room to watch Weide&amp;rsquo;s new documentary. Vonnegut once said all he wanted to do was poison people&amp;rsquo;s minds with humanity. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s what we can learn from his life: how to be kind, and how to be poisonous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist autumn 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This one is written for psychologists and students, and is the book that I wished I had read when I was an undergraduate. It examines why psychologists do what they do and aims to inspire the next generation of researchers.  It’s a personal journey into my favourite aspects of psychology, exploring how research can reveal the hidden workings of the mind, boost critical thinking, debunk myths, and improve lives. Along the way, I explain how to think like a psychologist, spot a liar, uncover the truth about happiness, and much more.  Several colleagues have been very kind about it and I hope that you enjoy it too!</p>
<p>“This engaging yet scrupulous introduction is ideal for those who wonder what psychology is really about.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Uta Frith,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> University College London</span></strong></p>
<p>“Reading this one-of-a-kind book, you feel as if you’re in a personal conversation with Richard Wiseman, one of the world’s most creative psychologists. He beautifully explains how psychologists gain insight into the human mind, expertly regales you with findings that are fascinating and surprising, and uncovers some of the many ways in which psychology improves lives. Perfect for students and professionals alike.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Elizabeth Loftus, Past President, </span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic">Association for Psychological Science</span></strong></p>
<p>“A fantastic book. No one is better than Richard Wiseman to write about what psychology does and doesn’t offer. The quality of the writing and research reported is excellent.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Cara Flanagan,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> top-selling author of A level psychology textbooks</span></strong></p>
<p>“This wonderfully entertaining book celebrates why psychology really matters, calls for even more meaningful research, and presents a manifesto for change. A thought-provoking text that is deserving of serious consideration by both students and professional psychologists.”<br/><strong><span class="a-text-bold">Adrian Owen, OBE, neuroscientist and author</span><span class="a-text-italic">,</span><span class="a-text-bold a-text-italic"> Western University</span></strong></p>

<p>First, I have co-authored (with Prof Caroline Watt) an article in PeerJ about the psychology of the impossible. It takes a look at research into impossible experiences across many different areas (including magic, dreaming, children’s play, and science fiction), examining how these experiences inspire creativity and have changed the world. It is free and can be be seen by clicking <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/13755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth and final issue of our Hocus Pocus comic has landed! This comic celebrates magic, mystery and the mind, and this issue is all about levitation. It has stories about stage magic, the Indian rope trick and seance room trickery. It has been enormous fun working with the creative team of Jordan Collver, Rik Worth and Owen Watts. The comic has been selling out fast and this issue is available now at <a href="https://www.propdog.co.uk/hocus-pocus-levitation">Propdog</a>.</p>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoD is back in business!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
