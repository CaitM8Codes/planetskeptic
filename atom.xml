&lt;p class="lead"&gt;I have addressed the &lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2014/10/10/cancers-arent-atavisms/"&gt;nonsense&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/05/13/davies-and-lineweaver-are-back-on-the-atavisms-bandwagon/"&gt;cancer as an atavism&lt;/a&gt; multiple &lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/07/17/paul-davies-is-not-a-medical-doctor/"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; here, and I even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s3Dgjb4y3w"&gt;made a video&lt;/a&gt; about it. Paul Davies is a medical crackpot, and his pal Charley Lineweaver is just as goofy, but it seems they noticed me, and I got a nice polite email from Lineweaver about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi PZ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just came across your video&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='282' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2s3Dgjb4y3w?version=3&amp;#038;rel=1&amp;#038;fs=1&amp;#038;autohide=2&amp;#038;showsearch=0&amp;#038;showinfo=1&amp;#038;iv_load_policy=1&amp;#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plead innocent of subscribing to the Haeckelian view that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Development stages recapitulate adult evolutionary stages&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at 14:38 of your video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remove the word &amp;#8220;adult&amp;#8221; then I would agree more with the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be interested in our two recent papers (attached).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as a biologist, you might be interested in an online video course&lt;br /&gt;
I just put up at   arewealone.us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s got a lot of biology in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find any egregious mistakes, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours for better science,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charley Lineweaver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I would note that removing one word doesn&amp;#8217;t help: &amp;#8220;Development stages recapitulate evolutionary stages&amp;#8221; is just as bad as &amp;#8220;Development stages recapitulate adult evolutionary stages&amp;#8221;. Development does not recapitulate the evolutionary history of the organism. Are we going to claim that mammals evolved from an ancient ancestor with a trophoblast that attached to a larger organism to leech off its fluids? Of course not. Mammalian extra-embryonic membranes are great examples of an evolutionary novelty appearing at a time in development that does not reflect a phylogenetic sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for his claim that cancers are atavistic reversions to a primitive state, see the links I posted above. Enough said. It&amp;#8217;s garbage science. I&amp;#8217;m just mildly horrified that yes, he sent me two more papers on the subject, published in 2021, and the idea is still getting published in respectable journals. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll dig into those papers some other time, but I think it&amp;#8217;s sufficient to dismiss them out of hand since they provide no new information, and are just more exercises in frantic handwaving. Flap, flap, flap, oh look, we made another paper. Flap, flap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was mildly intrigued by the web site he mentioned, calling it an &amp;#8220;online video course&amp;#8221;, which it isn&amp;#8217;t. It also doesn&amp;#8217;t have much biology in it. But you be the judge: visit &lt;a href="https://www.arewealone.us/"&gt;arewealone.us&lt;/a&gt; for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very nice of him to include a video summary of the &amp;#8220;course&amp;#8221;, titled &amp;#8220;The Course in 7 Minutes&amp;#8221;. Great, I can spare 7 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DhqeoamR-_0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t even give it 7 minutes, I&amp;#8217;m afraid. I skipped a lot, missing nothing of substance, because all it is is an excerpt from Beethoven&amp;#8217;s Fifth played while random images flash by. There is no content there. There are no words, no explanations, not even an attempt to stitch any kind of story or explanation to it. It&amp;#8217;s an incoherent mess. It is an accurate summary of the &amp;#8220;course&amp;#8221;, I&amp;#8217;ll give him that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dug deeper, and he does have kind of a syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Week 1  –  What does “Are We Alone?” Mean?&lt;br /&gt;
Week 2  –  Our Evolution Over 20 Million Years&lt;br /&gt;
Week 3  –  Our Evolution Over the Past 500 Million Years&lt;br /&gt;
Week 4  –  Our Evolution Over the Past 3 Billion Years&lt;br /&gt;
Week 5  –  Our Evolution Over the Past 4 Billion Years&lt;br /&gt;
Week 6  –  Origins of Life: What is Life?&lt;br /&gt;
Week 7  –  Intelligent Extraterrestrials?&lt;br /&gt;
Week 8  –  More Conversations with Experts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of those entries is a link to more videos, and once again, we descend into chaos. Lineweaver&amp;#8217;s approach seems to be to ask various of his science friends to let him interview them, and he drops by and sets up a camera in their office and asks a bunch of questions, like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="creationist"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This video-based course probes the question “Are we alone?” Unlike SETI scientists, Mars rovers and planet-hunting astronomers, we take a biological approach and ask: “How did WE get here?” Like salmon swimming upriver to the pond where they were born, we are led upstream from whence we came. We take a pilgrimage into the past to the origin of life 4 billion years ago. During this evolutionary odyssey with astrobiologist Charley Lineweaver, we ask: Who is “we”? Why did our brains get so big? How did life get started? Are viruses alive? What is life? Answers to these questions may help us get from How DID life start? to How DOES life start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a confusing collection of short (typically 5-6 minutes) video interviews. There is no synthesis. There are no answers, not even an attempt to assemble some kind of consensus. I watched a few and then gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were asked, &amp;#8220;are we alone?&amp;#8221;, my answer would be something like, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know, but probably not. I think the prebiotic chemistry that led to life is probably universal, so it could be common, but we&amp;#8217;ve got an n of 1 so far. If we found signs of ancient life on Mars, though, that would increase the probability of life of some sort being common.&amp;#8221; That&amp;#8217;s all we&amp;#8217;ve got so far. I also think that anyone who says yes, absolutely, or no, absolutely, isn&amp;#8217;t worth talking to further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would turn the questions about, though, and ask how Charley Lineweaver, an honorary associate professor at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics and Research School of Earth Science at the Australian National University, a man with an advanced education that is entirely in physics, who has a PhD in physics from Berkeley, gets to call himself an astro&lt;em&gt;biologist&lt;/em&gt;, and does that mean I get to call myself an astro&lt;em&gt;physicist&lt;/em&gt;, despite an education that was almost exclusively in biology, and despite having a position as a biology professor? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait. He also says he is &amp;#8220;the son of a high school biology teacher&amp;#8221;, so I guess he inherited his parent&amp;#8217;s qualifications. With that logic, that means that my father&amp;#8217;s line of work means I get to call myself a diesel mechanic now. Or maybe an &lt;em&gt;astro&lt;/em&gt; diesel mechanic?&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">Right now, Minnesota has a conservative/centrist Democrat as governor. It would be nice if we had a reasonable set of alternatives to vote for in the next election, but I fear I’m going to have to vote for gun-nut Walz again, because <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/minnesota-gop-reconvenes-back-candidate-150826201.html?fr=yhssrp_catchall">the Republicans have announced who they’re putting on the ballot</a>: Scott Jensen, an MD from Chaska, one of those suburban towns that ring Minneapolis/St Paul and that spawn horrible creatures like Bachmann who embarrass us with their open endorsement idiocy.</p>
<p>Guess what his positions are: he thinks COVID wasn’t as bad as the government says it is, and didn’t warrant the disruption of our economy. When all the piles of dead people were pointed out to him, he <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/episode/2022/03/15/republican-gubernatorial-candidate-dr-scott-jensen">trivialized them and claimed that the numbers were inflated</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>I think that what we have, when you say killed, I would say that COVID-19 may well have played a part. I would say that if this is a person who’s dying of stage 4 colon cancer, and COVID was diagnosed in the last 48 to 72 hours and it was put down as a COVID death I think that’s problematic. </p></blockquote>
<p>How nice to know as I get older, the value of the days of my life are less and less valuable.</p>
<p>You can trust Dr Jensen, though! He’s an authority!</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>I studied epidemiology in 1976 and ‘77 when I was in dental school.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow. He took a class more than 40 years ago, so now he’s an expert.</p>
<p>He’s also anti-choice. He wants to ban <em>all</em> abortions, with no exceptions for rape or incest.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>I would try to ban abortion, I think that we’re we’re basically in a situation where we should be governed by … there is no reason for us to be having abortions going out. We have tremendous opportunities and availability of birth control. We don’t need to be snuffing out lives that if left alone will produce a viable newborn, that may go on to be the next Albert Einstein. We can be so much better than we’ve been. We do not need to be having Hillary Clinton casually discuss the value and the reasonableness of late third trimester abortions, when you’ve got literally, you’ve got a life that’s a few inches away from passing through a birth canal and being the source of tremendous love. And we’re saying no, if mom changes your mind, she can go ahead and slice and dice it and be done with it. I don’t think that’s where we want to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess our lives are on a sliding scale, from incredibly precious before birth to casually discardable in your old age. What’s most important isn’t the life you’ve lived, but rather the potential of the days you have remaining.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll be punching Walz’s name in the next election.</p>

<p class="lead">Texas is screwing the rest of the country, again. They passed a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/05/12/just-how-incredibly-fucked-up-is-texas-social-media-content-moderation-law/">law against internet “censorship”</a> that is nothing but ludicrous aggravation about certain people (e.g., Donald Trump) getting moderated and banned, so the conservatives are pushing through a law that will have the trolls and spammers dancing in the streets.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>CENSORSHIP PROHIBITED. (a) A social media platform may not censor a user, a user’s expression, or a user’s ability to receive the expression of another person based on:<br/>
(1) the viewpoint of the user or another person;<br/>
(2) the viewpoint represented in the user’s expression or another person’s expression; or<br/>
(3) a user’s geographic location in this state or any part of this state.<br/>
(b) This section applies regardless of whether the viewpoint is expressed on a social media platform or through any other medium.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but even I can see problems here. I’ll let <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/05/12/just-how-incredibly-fucked-up-is-texas-social-media-content-moderation-law/">someone else explain it</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, let’s break this down. It says that a website cannot “censor” (by which it clearly means moderate) based on the user’s viewpoint or geographic location. And it applies even if that viewpoint doesn’t occur on the website.</p>
<p>What does that mean in practice? First, even if there is a good and justifiable reason for moderating the content — say it’s spam or harassment or inciting violence — that really doesn’t matter. The user can simply claim that it’s because of their viewpoints — even those expressed elsewhere — and force the company to fight it out in court. This is every spammer’s dream. Spammers would love to be able to force websites to accept their spam. And this law basically says that if you remove spam, the spammer can take you to court.</p>
<p>Indeed, nearly all of the moderation that websites like Twitter and Facebook do are, contrary to the opinion of ignorant ranters, not because of any “viewpoint” but because they’re breaking actual rules around harassment, abuse, spam, or the like.</p>
<p>While the law does say that a site must clearly post its acceptable use policy, so that supporters of this law can flat out lie and claim that a site can still moderate as long as it follows its policies, that’s not true. Because, again, all any aggrieved user has to do is to claim the real reason is due to viewpoint discrimination, and the litigation is on.</p>
<p>And let me tell you something about aggrieved users: they always insist that any moderation, no matter how reasonable, is because of their viewpoint. Always. And this is especially true of malicious actors and trolls, who are in the game of trolling just to annoy in the first place. If they can take that up a notch and drag companies into court as well? I mean, the only thing stopping them will be the cost, but you already know that a cottage industry is going to pop up of lawyers who will file these cases. I wouldn’t even be surprised if cases start getting filed today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Great. I know I posted a comment policy for this little ol’ site, but it’s buried in the archives somewhere. Guess I’ll have to dig it and make it more prominent.</p>
<p>I have another grievance with this law, though. I should be able to block people on the basis of their viewpoint! If someone starts commenting about how women don’t deserve to be regarded as equals of men, for example, I ought to be able to say, “No, we’re not going to tolerate that nonsense here. Bye.” The law doesn’t apply to places like Freethoughtblogs — it sets a cap, where you have to have over 50 million monthly users for it to go into effect — so I’m not about to get sued by the hundreds of people on my blocklist, but in general, a lot of the big social media sites are going to become unusable if all the trolls are set free, and you know the authors of the bill would love to go after every website left of center.</p>
<p>Also bad: they want to liberate spammers.</p>
<blockquote><p>And, that’s not all. Remember last week when I was joking about how Republicans wanted to make sure your inboxes were filled with spam? I had forgotten about the provision in this law that makes a lot of spam filtering a violation of the law. I only wish I was joking. For unclear reasons, the law also amends Texas’ existing anti-spam law. It added (and it’s already live in the law) a section saying the following:</p>
<blockquote class="creationist">
<p>Sec. 321.054. IMPEDING ELECTRONIC MAIL MESSAGES PROHIBITED. An electronic mail service provider may not intentionally impede the transmission of another person’s electronic mail message based on the content of the message unless:</p>
<p>(1) the provider is authorized to block the transmission under Section 321.114 or other applicable state or federal law; or</p>
<p>(2) the provider has a good faith, reasonable belief that the message contains malicious computer code, obscene material, material depicting sexual conduct, or material that violates other law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that literally says the only reasons you can “impede” email is if it contains malicious code, obscene material, sexual content, or violates other laws. Now the reference to 321.114 alleviates some of this, since that section gives services (I kid you not) “qualified immunity” for blocking certain commercial email messages, but only with certain conditions, including enabling a dispute resolution process for spammers.</p>
<p>There are many more problems with this law, but I am perplexed at how anyone could possibly think this is either workable or Constitutional. It’s neither. The only proper thing to do would be to shut down in Texas, but again the law treats that as a violation itself. What an utter monstrosity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in the old days, when Pharyngula was run off a Macintosh in my lab and I had full access to every nut and bolt in the server software, I had all kinds of protections in place to automatically block spammers. A few times, as an experiment, I’d turn off the filters and was astonished at how many bad actors were constantly probing, trying to hack in or flood the system with spam — hundreds per second. And I was just a tiny little PowerMac sitting in a little lab somewhere. </p>
<p>I just checked my email spam folder, which gets purged every week: 830 messages trying to sell me CBD Gummies, extended warranties, real estate, lawn care products, and oh, cool, an offer to be named a joint author on a paper to be submitted to an Indian research journal for only a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p>The internet cannot operate without extensive content moderation. The judges and legislators who signed off on this law are clearly incompetent and unaware, and are probably a gang of Republicans terrified of “cancel culture”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views.” So begins a draft opinion by Associate Justice Samuel Alito, leaked from the US Supreme Court on May 2, 2022. If confirmed, this judgement would overrule the Court’s past decisions to establish the right to access abortion. In Alito’s words, “the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives”. The Court’s opinion rests on a strictly historical interpretation of the US Constitution: “The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.” His extraordinary text repeatedly equates abortion with murder.<br/>
The Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution has been the main foundation underpinning the right of American women to an abortion. That 1868 Amendment was passed during the period of American Reconstruction, when states’ powers were being subjected to certain limitations. The goal of the Amendment was to prevent states from unduly restricting the freedoms of their citizens. That guarantee of personal liberty, so the Supreme Court had previously held, extended to pregnant women, with qualifications, who decided to seek an abortion. Alito rejected that reasoning. He argued that for any right not mentioned in the Constitution to be protected, it must be shown to have had deep roots in the nation’s history and tradition. Abortion does not fulfil that test. Worse, Roe was an exercise in “raw judicial power”, it “short-circuited the democratic process”, and it was “egregiously wrong” from the very beginning. It was now time, according to Alito, “to set the record straight”.<br/>
What is so shocking, inhuman, and irrational about this draft opinion is that the Court is basing its decision on an 18th century document ignorant of 21st century realities for women. History and tradition can be respected, but they must only be partial guides. The law should be able to adapt to new and previously unanticipated challenges and predicaments. Although Alito gives an exhaustive legal history of abortion, he utterly fails to consider the health of women today who seek abortion. Unintended pregnancy and abortion are universal phenomena. Worldwide, around 120 million unintended pregnancies occur annually. Of these, three-fifths end in abortion. And of these, some 55% are estimated to be safe—that is, completed using a medically recommended method and performed by a trained provider. This leaves 33 million women undergoing unsafe abortions, their lives put at risk because laws restrict access to safe abortion services.<br/>
In the USA, Black women have an unintended pregnancy rate double that of non-Hispanic White women. And the maternal mortality rate for Black women, to which unsafe abortion is an important contributor, is almost three times higher than for white women. These sharp racial and class disparities need urgent solutions, not more legal barriers. The fact is that if the US Supreme Court confirms its draft decision, women will die. The Justices who vote to strike down Roe will not succeed in ending abortion, they will only succeed in ending safe abortion. Alito and his supporters will have women’s blood on their hands.<br/>
The 2018 Guttmacher–Lancet Commission on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights For All concluded that these rights, which included the right to safe abortion services and the treatment of complications from unsafe abortion, were central to any conception of a woman’s wellbeing and gender equality. The availability of an essential package of sexual and reproductive health interventions should be a fundamental right for all women—including, comprehensive sexuality education; access to modern contraceptives; safe abortion services; prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmissible diseases; prevention and treatment for gender-based violence; counselling for sexual health; and services for infertility. What kind of society has the USA become when a small group of Justices is allowed to harm women, their families, and their communities that they have been appointed to protect?<br/>
The route forward is unclear and perilous. This Court’s argument suggests possible future attacks on a raft of other civil rights, from marriage equality to contraception. Despite urgent pleas from some members of Congress, the long-overdue encoding of Roe into law by the Biden administration is highly unlikely. That a Court is about to force through a health policy supported by only 39% of Americans is dysfunctional. Indeed, if the Court denies women the right to safe abortion, it will be a judicial endorsement of state control over women—a breathtaking setback for the health and rights of women, one that will have global reverberations.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Steven Pinker giving a lecture for Humanists UK (Wikimedia Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Steven_Pinker.jpg" height="835" alt="Steven Pinker" width="1252" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Steven Pinker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a tour de force training manual on how to think. Lessons in logical deduction, in avoiding cognitive biases and probability blunders, and in how to recognise fallacies all provide stimulus for vital mental spring-cleaning. Not merely instructive, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationality&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is also an affirmation of many of the most fundamental humanist commitments: the simple beauty of the recursive nature of reason, the indispensability of rationality to deliberative democracy, the celebration of science, ethics and law as the greatest achievements of human rationality.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;aspires to do more than just explain, define and describe its eponymous concept. Its full subtitle asks not just &amp;ldquo;What [rationality] is&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;Why it seems scarce, Why it matters&amp;rdquo;. And it isn&amp;rsquo;t a utopian tract, arguing for human beings as perfect rational actors who go astray only when manipulated or misled. In many forms, Pinker says, rationality is counterintuitive &amp;ndash; we often need to engineer it. So, bookending the chapters that deal with the many aspects of the nature of rationality is Pinker&amp;rsquo;s most urgent call: to understand that rationality does matter, that it needs defending, and that we must advance it.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s focus is a natural extension of the Canadian-American&amp;rsquo;s inquiries to date. As a public intellectual and committed member of the humanist movement &amp;ndash; as well as a cognitive psychologist and psycholinguist &amp;ndash; Pinker&amp;rsquo;s work, especially his 2011 book &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(2018), has argued consistently and forcefully for the importance of science, reason and humanism to the advancement of our species. As Chief Executive of Humanists UK, I was especially keen to discuss the book with Pinker &amp;ndash; particularly the idea, as he summarised it to me, that &amp;ldquo;good things only happen as a result of human ingenuity and reason deployed toward humanistic goals&amp;rdquo;. I enthusiastically agree. But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to entice someone like me to embrace and celebrate the case for rationality. What about those who are not yet convinced, who may be the very people fighting for social change?&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the reasons that I&amp;rsquo;m active in the humanist movement,&amp;rdquo; he tells me, &amp;ldquo;is I think we can provide reasons why some goals are better than others by pointing out how they are consistent with other values that virtually everyone claims to believe.&amp;rdquo; Yet for Pinker&amp;rsquo;s aim of advancing rationality to be meaningfully fulfilled, it does seem to me that we must do more than rationally point out the inconsistencies in the thinking of others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Making use of myth?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Towards the end of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Pinker classifies beliefs into two types. The first belong in our &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; mindset. We arrive at and sustain these beliefs by reasoning about facts in our direct experience: water will boil at 100 degrees; cooking food will make it edible and nourishing. As these examples imply, beliefs of the reality type are also those that are essential to our everyday lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beliefs of the second type &amp;ndash; those in our &amp;ldquo;mythology&amp;rdquo; mindset &amp;ndash; operate in a different zone. They relate to the worlds beyond our direct experience: the long ago, the far away, the metaphysical. The functions of these beliefs are different from the beliefs in our reality mindset, and broader. They provide entertainment, moral lessons, a sense of meaning, social solidarity and more. Conspiracy theories, superstitions, comforting falsehoods, religions and tribalisms all live in our mythology mindset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As inheritors of the enlightenment tradition, committed to its dynamic continuation, we are duty-bound &amp;ndash; so &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; argues &amp;ndash; to make sure that as many of our beliefs as possible fall into the &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; mindset. But I realised, reflecting on the book, that my own commitment to rationality has a considerable amount of the mythological about it.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I remember the first time I read a legal judgement. I can recall the admirable clarity with which the judge assessed the evidence presented to her. The arguments lawyers had made were considered, and &amp;ndash; step by logical step &amp;ndash; a judicious conclusion was reached. I found the experience of reading her words enormously satisfying. I didn&amp;rsquo;t just regard the rationality of her process as an effective way of getting to the truth. I felt a sort of pleasure as the judgement unfolded and took shape. At the end, I felt an aesthetic appreciation at something having been done properly.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It reminded me of my favourite work of theatre, Aeschylus&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Oresteia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Its final scene is an enactment of the first ever court, presided over by the goddess Athena, where adversarial truth-seeking justice replaces blood guilt and vengeance. Written two and a half millennia ago, it depicted the mythical world of centuries before that, providing an inspiring origin story for rational adjudication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Thinking about that scene and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Oresteia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; brings to mind what Einstein said about the Greeks, that they were the first to &amp;ldquo;overcome man&amp;rsquo;s insecurity before himself and before nature&amp;rdquo; and the first who &amp;ldquo;wrought a system of thought whose conclusions no one could escape&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a beautiful way of describing both the art of reasoning and its profound consequences. What the broadcaster and humanist Jacob Bronowksi called this Greek &amp;ldquo;assertion of confidence&amp;rdquo; evokes the 20th-century scientific confidence that people like Bronowski and Einstein represent. I see the centuries-long chain of men and women who have carved out a space for truth and justice in an indifferent universe &amp;ndash; their effort, their commitment, their inspiring struggle. In this timeless community, as the humanist philosopher Harold Blackham put it, &amp;ldquo;Nothing is exempt from human question. There is no immemorial tradition, no revelation, no authority, no privileged knowledge . . . which is beyond question because [it is] beyond experience and which can be used as a standard by which to interpret experience. There is only experience to be interpreted in the light of further experience, the sole source of all standards of reason and value, forever open to question.&amp;rdquo; Rationality is the golden thread that runs through so much that makes the human story vital and vivid in my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ll this may lack the sensuousness of Proust&amp;rsquo;s madeleine, but it&amp;rsquo;s plain that my own commitment to rationality at least in part resides in the category of mythological belief, a weaving together of all these narratives and more. This mythology even has its own magic. The three little words &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s be reasonable&amp;rdquo; always have the power to recall me to calmness. &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; I think, &amp;ldquo;we should be reasonable. I was being unreasonable and overheated. I should stop that.&amp;rdquo; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to let Athena down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;This is very personal, but it is not merely by way of autobiography. I am not the only one whose most powerful motivations come from my &amp;ldquo;mythological&amp;rdquo; beliefs, nor the only person who is more likely to be rational if the case for doing so can be made more vivid and warm. So, to return to my question arising from Pinker&amp;rsquo;s new book: if we do need to find ways to promote rationality &amp;ndash; and it won&amp;rsquo;t do to just tell people it is fact-based and true &amp;ndash; should we make use of the mythology mindset, and not just the principles exhorted in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? I put this to Pinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do we want to have humanist preachers rolling back their eyes and pumping copies of Spinoza&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span class="s1"&gt;Ethics&lt;/span&gt; on the pulpit?&amp;rdquo; he responds. &amp;ldquo;Probably not.&amp;rdquo; But, he says, &amp;ldquo;we do need something. We are human. We are motivated by ideals, images, heroes. I think that is reasonable to the extent that we know how to bottle them so that they don&amp;rsquo;t infect our understanding of reality. If it&amp;rsquo;s a way to engage our emotions toward ends that we can justify on humanist grounds, then it&amp;rsquo;s probably wise, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a challenge that we ought to step up to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expressed the hope that this could be achieved through &amp;ldquo;mythologies&amp;rdquo;, but Pinker is much more comfortable with the idea that rhetoric will provide motivation: &amp;ldquo;Maybe we have to study the cases of successful political leadership and rhetoric that managed to engage people&amp;rsquo;s emotions toward goals that we all can best justify.&amp;rdquo; He singles out Martin Luther King, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barack Obama. &amp;ldquo;It is an art that I think probably requires a rare combination of talents &amp;ndash; intellectual and interpersonal and emotional. I do what I&amp;rsquo;m capable of doing, which is making the case. It ain&amp;rsquo;t Martin Luther King. But, you know, maybe it would inspire some future version of Martin Luther King!&amp;rdquo;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In fact, the prose of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; frequently inspires, and there are many passages that would qualify as required reading on any curriculum of &amp;ldquo;rationalist myth-making&amp;rdquo;, if such a thing were thought desirable after all. But I come to my next question, on advancing the case for rationality. In his book, Pinker argues that being rational has an image problem and that this is one cause of the current crisis of reason. To be rational is not seen as &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;; it&amp;rsquo;s an unattractive thing to aspire to. This may be true, but it&amp;rsquo;s not my biggest concern. Perhaps I am defeatist, but I have taken it as read that many people are going to behave irrationally a lot of the time and that rationality will never be the predominant fashion. What worries me most today is the possibility that the people most inspired by justice, equality and human dignity may be averse to the idea of rationality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Rationalism and social change&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Pinker takes aim in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; at what he sees as an unhelpful trend: that young people on university campuses are pursuing social justice while adhering to &amp;ldquo;fashionable academic movements&amp;rdquo; that &amp;ldquo;hold that reason, truth and objectivity are social constructions that justify the privilege of dominant groups&amp;rdquo;. Because the students aligned with these movements also, he says, believe that &amp;ldquo;western philosophy and science are parochial, old-fashioned, and naive to the diverse ways of knowing found across periods and cultures&amp;rdquo;, Pinker places them outside of the rational.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t think rationality is a parochial cultural product. But I do see that it can be preached in aid of the privilege of dominant groups, especially economically dominant ones, and I understand why the people Pinker is talking about feel that way.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The plea of &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s be reasonable&amp;rdquo; from friend to friend might annoy you in the instant, but it does no harm. Between colleagues who share a certain discipline it may be vital, recalling us both to a shared standard. But a plea to be reasonable in the context of the struggle for equality or justice has less palatable associations. I, the rational actor, am calling on you to bring yourself into line. The implication is that you are too emotional, perhaps overly demanding. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious why the suspicion arises that rationality works against the interests of the less powerful and the vulnerable. This is worrying, especially if we have a particular obligation to persuade those committed to humanistic goals that human reason is the way to realise their hopes. So I ask how we can make rationality appealing to those who promote social justice, democracy and human rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinker responds that it is rational arguments, not angry protestors, that have historically triggered social change, disputing the idea advanced by his campus radicals that progress is &amp;ldquo;a story of struggle, with the downtrodden rising up and overcoming their oppressors&amp;rdquo;. His general theory of social progress is that &amp;ldquo;the first domino [is] a reasoned argument&amp;rdquo;. A philosopher wrote a text or manifesto and &amp;ldquo;eventually the conclusion was absorbed into the conventional wisdom and common decency of a society, erasing the tracks of the argument that brought it there&amp;rdquo;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We agree, however, that rationality is not the only tool required to achieve moral progress and that, as the book clearly states, there is no iron law of history. Human societies are not laboratories and no firm conclusions can be drawn about what &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo;. Nonetheless, Pinker strongly prefers the rational argument theory. I am not so sure. Even the Enlightenment-soaked founding fathers of the US didn&amp;rsquo;t reason George III out of his malfeasance. They overthrew him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, Pinker does persuade me that we have a strong argument for convincing progressives of the importance of rationality to achieving social change. &amp;ldquo;The rights of the downtrodden, the oppressed and the less privileged ought to be fostered and I for one am not willing to say that&amp;rsquo;s an irrational argument, quite the contrary,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s ultimately a rational one, stemming from the principle of the equality of all humans. This itself is an inherently rational proposition, because it simply hinges on the fact that the pronouns &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo; have no logical status. The idea &amp;lsquo;Whatever I claim for myself, I have to grant to you equally&amp;rsquo; is just built into rational discourse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Pinker says much of the need to re-engineer our world for rationality, from working to valorise it in popular culture to building it further into our school curricula. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful manifesto: we do need to build and maintain resilient rationality-based institutions in every area of our common life. But I am left thinking that the main path out of our present difficulties may be the one that he expresses later &amp;ndash; and quite beautifully &amp;ndash; in our conversation. Putting rationality at the very heart of the case we make for our love and care for each other is what can in turn give rationality itself back its heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Deep fakes: the new front in the disinformation wars</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5965/deep-fakes-the-new-front-in-the-disinformation-wars#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/zelensky_lecturn.jpg" height="1281" alt="President Zelensky was the target of a deep fake video" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In a media landscape in which the truth often seems to get lost in noise and disinformation, the increasing use of deepfakes is a particularly worrying trend. Synthetic video content &amp;ndash; that is, video which is wholly or partly generated by artificial intelligence &amp;ndash; has been in widespread use since at least 2017. Until now, however, it has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/7/20902215/deepfakes-usage-youtube-2019-deeptrace-research-report"&gt;largely been used&lt;/a&gt; for non-consensual pornography, targeting women by using their likeness without their consent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;This year, this developing technology &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60780142"&gt;has been weaponised&lt;/a&gt; in the Russia-Ukraine war. In March, a deepfake video was released, apparently showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons. It was unsuccessful. After the TV channel Ukraine 24 was hacked so that its website displayed the video, Zelensky was alerted and posted a Facebook video explaining that it was a fake. Twitter and YouTube were quick to announce that they were tracking and removing the video where it was being shared, as it breached their rules on deceptive synthetic media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;However, as a &lt;a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/09/05/campaigns-must-prepare-for-deepfakes-this-is-what-their-plan-should-look-like-pub-79792"&gt;playbook for defeating deepfakes &lt;/a&gt;that the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace released in 2019 put it, while digital fakery can, for now, be detected pretty easily, &amp;ldquo;People have a visceral reaction to video and audio. They believe what their eyes and ears are telling them &amp;ndash; even if all signs suggest that the video and audio content is fake.&amp;rdquo; Since that report, artificial intelligence has advanced, substantially increasing the realism of deepfakes and cutting the resources required to create them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;How do we face this coming tide of disinformation? New technology is part of the picture. In late 2020, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) &lt;a href="https://governmentciomedia.com/darpa-launches-new-programs-detect-falsified-media#:~:text=The%20Defense%20Advanced%20Research%20Projects,falsified%20media%2C%20such%20as%20deepfakes."&gt;launched a Media Forensics programme&lt;/a&gt; to develop new prototypes to identify and combat falsified media. They use detection algorithms, which analyse media content to determine if manipulation has occurred; and fusion algorithms, which combine information across multiple detectors to create an &amp;ldquo;integrity score&amp;rdquo; for each media asset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But as Nina Schick, author of &lt;em&gt;Deepfakes: The Coming Infocalypse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepfakes-porn-politics"&gt;pointed out recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; magazine, &amp;ldquo;our crisis of information will not be for technology to solve alone. Any technological solutions will be useless unless we humans are able to adapt to this new environment where fake media is commonplace.&amp;rdquo; This will require &amp;ldquo;inoculation&amp;rdquo; through digital-literacy and awareness training, along with concerted action from government, military and civil groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;We need to prepare now for this rising threat to our information eco-system. At the moment, it is relatively easy to spot deepfake videos. As the recent video of Zelensky shows, such fakes can be countered with a prompt response. But as technology advances, it is only a matter of time before we will need additional tools and strategies in order to distinguish a deepfake from the real thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a3-a7 a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a-all a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Will the killing of a schoolteacher have any effect on Pakistan's blasphemy laws?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5966/will-the-killing-of-a-schoolteacher-have-any-effect-on-pakistans-blasphemy-laws#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="GHRD protest against blasphemy laws, 2018" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/GHRD_Protest-_22nd_sept_2018_Geneva2.jpg" height="1200" alt="GHRD protest, 2018" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In Pakistan, blasphemy is a crime that carries the death sentence &amp;ndash; but many of those accused do not make it as far as sentencing, instead being murdered by vigilantes. According to the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies, &lt;a href="https://crss.pk/blasphemy-cases-in-pakistan-1947-2021/"&gt;at least 89 citizens &lt;/a&gt;have been murdered in killings related to blasphemy cases since Pakistan was established in 1947. There were five last year alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Even against this grim backdrop, the &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dga85/woman-teacher-killed-blasphemy-dream-pakistan"&gt;recent murder of Safoora Bibi,&lt;/a&gt; a teacher at an all-girls religious school in Pakistan, is striking for its particularly horrific nature and the rarity of the killers being women: a female colleague and two of the victim&amp;rsquo;s former students have been accused. The girls told police that a relative dreamed that Bibi had committed blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad. Police are investigating whether the killing was in fact related to a personal feud. This is often at the root of blasphemy allegations in Pakistan, since the potential punishment is so high and the burden of proof so low (accusers can even refuse to repeat the alleged blasphemy for fear of blaspheming themselves).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Last December, Priyantha Kumara, a Sri Lankan general manager of a garment factory in Sialkot, a city in Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s Punjab region, was &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/3/sri-lankan-factory-manager-lynched-and-set-on-fire-in-pakistan"&gt;bludgeoned to death by a mob&lt;/a&gt; after reportedly removing posters that had sections from the Koran written on them. Many people, including the president of the local chamber of commerce, maintain that Kumara was in fact targeted by his factory&amp;rsquo;s workers over a personal grudge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;According to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, about &lt;a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2019%20Pakistan%20Blasphemy.pdf"&gt;80 people in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; are in prison for blasphemy, with at least half facing a life sentence or death. There have been no executions since the moratorium on the death penalty 14 years ago. However, there is some evidence that the death penalty emboldens ordinary citizens to carry out vigilante killings in Pakistan. Some of the goriest mob lynchings occurred after the moratorium was introduced. Perpetrators of these vigilante killings are rarely brought to justice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Whatever the motive of the women who killed Safoora Bibi, attacks based on blasphemy accusations look set to continue. With Pakistan mired in a broader political crisis after Imran Khan was ousted, a change to the law is not on the agenda: in the last 15 years, politicians who proposed reform have been threatened and even killed. As long as the country has some of the strictest blasphemy laws in the the world, we will continue to see innocent people murdered by their fellow citizens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a3-a7 a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a-all a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Turning our backs on the vulnerable</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5964/turning-our-backs-on-the-vulnerable#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Ukrainian women and children refugees at a checkpoint" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ukranian_women_and_children.jpg" height="695" alt="Ukrainian refugees at a checkpoint" width="1043" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It is increasingly obvious to the British population, and the world at large, that the UK government is going out of its way to avoid its moral and international obligations towards refugees. On 27 April, the Nationality and Borders Act finally passed through parliament, despite evidence that it risks criminalising asylum seekers and denying their right to reunion with their families already in the country. Meanwhile, the Homes for Ukraine scheme &amp;ndash; through which individuals, charities and business can sponsor refugees fleeing the Russia-Ukraine war &amp;ndash; has grabbed headlines while falling behind on targets, as Ukrainians struggle to actually obtain the visas required, with many of the spare rooms offered remaining empty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The immigration bill had been stuck in parliament since last July, and to force it through the government dropped one of the more controversial aspects: the so-called &amp;ldquo;push-back&amp;rdquo; policy that would allow the UK to stop asylum seekers in the Channel and send their dinghies back to France. However, the new legislation still penalises refugees entitled to asylum in the UK for having reached the country via &amp;ldquo;illegal&amp;rdquo; means. The government has repeatedly claimed that the aim is to crack down on people-smuggling gangs and to prevent deaths at sea. However, they were&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/fury-as-patels-borders-bill-found-misleading-on-safe-routes-for-migrants"&gt; forced to admit &lt;/a&gt;in April that the bill contained no provision for safe and legal routes for asylum seekers into Britain. Therefore this argument appears to be disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Thus far, &lt;a href="https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/bond-and-over-150-organisations-lobby-government-to-scrap-cruel-rwanda-asylum-plan.html"&gt;160 charities and campaign groups&lt;/a&gt; have branded the bill &amp;ldquo;shamefully cruel&amp;rdquo;. The UNHCR, meanwhile, has raised concerns that the law will undermine the Refugee Convention, along with Britain&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;longstanding global cooperation on refugee issues&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Particular concerns have been raised over the new legislation allowing for the removal of refugees to other countries. Some critics have questioned the feasibility of the &amp;pound;120 million deal with Rwanda for offshore housing of asylum seekers, given the legal challenges such a scheme is likely to face. But the possibility of such a development has prompted outrage. The move has been seen as further evidence of Britain seeking to abandon its international obligations, and to shirk its ethical responsibility to provide safe refuge to people fleeing war and persecution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Meanwhile, a whistleblower working for the Homes for Ukraine scheme &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/homes-for-ukraine-whistleblower-says-uk-refugee-scheme-is-designed-to-fail"&gt;has claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the policy was &amp;ldquo;designed to fail&amp;rdquo;, in order to limit the numbers of Ukrainians entering the country. Announced in the Commons as advancing Britain&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;long and proud history&amp;rdquo; of supporting the most vulnerable &amp;ldquo;in their darkest hours&amp;rdquo;, the scheme was criticised from the start for requiring asylum seekers toapply for a visa. This bureaucratic process &amp;ndash; in which people are sometimes expected to travel hundreds of miles to passport or visa offices &amp;ndash; drastically limits and slows a process intended to aid victims of war who may be in immediate danger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The Refugee Council has &lt;a href="https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/homes-for-ukraine-scheme-refugee-council-response/"&gt;expressed concern &lt;/a&gt;about the prospect of housing traumatised people with individuals who had not been through any robust checks or training, while it&amp;rsquo;s still unclear what will happen to refugees after the six-month stint with sponsors comes to an end. This latest whistleblower leak, claiming that the system was designed to &amp;ldquo;keep the numbers down&amp;rdquo;, seems to confirm suspicions that limitations aren&amp;rsquo;t a bug, but rather a feature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Taken in the round, the least cynical of observers might conclude that the UK government&amp;rsquo;s priority is simply to keep refugee numbers low. Thus far, appeals to moral and international commitments have been ignored, as has the opinion of the British public, whose views in a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/migrants-asylum-rwanda-boris-johnson-b2058114.html"&gt;recent YouGov poll&lt;/a&gt; showed the majority opposed the Rwanda deal, with 27 per cent &amp;ldquo;strongly opposed&amp;rdquo;. So much for Britain&amp;rsquo;s much-trumpeted &amp;ldquo;long and proud history&amp;rdquo; of providing refuge for the vulnerable &amp;ndash; at least where the current government is concerned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: What Strange Paradise</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5955/book-review-what-strange-paradise#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-07-at-15.01.46.jpg" height="758" alt="What strange paradise" width="942" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Along the far end of the port of Lesbos, I watch two Afghan boys push battered mountain bikes against a wind that drives in from the water, past a military vessel emblazoned with an EU flag. Farther out at sea, the forms of violence &amp;ndash; from the elements or at the hands of those commanding such vessels &amp;ndash; being delivered to others like these boys are difficult to think about. Yet it is into just such a world that Omar El Akkad draws us. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Set on an unnamed Aegean island, as well as in Egypt and on the fickle waters in between, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;What Strange Paradise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; traces the journey of a young Syrian boy across the Mediterranean to Europe. Nine-year-old Amir inadvertently finds himself aboard a smuggler&amp;rsquo;s rickety vessel in Alexandria whose wreckage is ultimately washed up on a European beach. The novel is structured into interlacing chapters of before and after, which recount Amir&amp;rsquo;s hazardous passage and the similarly perilous adventure following his arrival.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Central to the latter is the novel&amp;rsquo;s other key protagonist, the teenage Vanna: a second-generation northern European migrant whose family owns a failed guesthouse on the tourist-laden island. It is Vanna who first encounters Amir after his apparent brush with death. She becomes his accomplice in a mission to deliver him from the hands of the local police and asylum system to the mainland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It is a Manichean world of azure sunlit beaches and blackened nights on a tormenting sea, where those seeking safety are ruthlessly exploited by smugglers and then rounded up at gunpoint by the authorities on arrival. Yet it is illuminated by individual acts of solidarity and heroism. El Akkad&amp;rsquo;s portrait of contemporary asylum-seeking &amp;ndash; its violence, mercilessness and tedium, relieved by flashes of altruism &amp;ndash; gives the uninitiated vivid insight into the realities of what is commonly called the EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;migrant crisis&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, the opening passage in which Amir&amp;rsquo;s small body lies prostrate in the sand is an obvious reanimation of the image of the Kurdish toddler Alan Kurdi, whose tiny corpse unleashed a tide of global attention when it appeared in 2015. Yet El Akkad simultaneously plays with the boundaries of social realism, stretching them such that the story takes on a fable-like hue. It is unsurprising then that the author expresses a love of alchemy in writing, describing the book as a repurposing of the tale of Peter Pan: Vanna the young Wendy on the threshold of adulthood and escapism, and Captain Hook manifest in the novel&amp;rsquo;s steely Colonel Kethros, who, with his amputated leg, doggedly pursues the two children across the island.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The novel is thus also distinctly cinematic, populated by archetypes (the villainous smuggler, the conflicted young officer, the maternal Muslim woman) and driven by fast-paced action and pithy dialogue. At times, this dynamic can feel on the verge of trite. Kethros suffers from PTSD from military service in the Balkans, but this background of trauma is underdeveloped, while the fable-like simplicity in parts of the novel sits at odds with the nuances of its realism elsewhere, such as Vanna&amp;rsquo;s complex relationship with her distant mother. Nonetheless, the novel is interwoven with truths of such universal resonance, told with poignancy, that the reader often pauses between lines. Most resonant is El Akkad&amp;rsquo;s characterisation of the human relationship to place and to those perceived as outsiders. Vanna&amp;rsquo;s body, for example &amp;ndash; with its white skin, blue eyes and blond hair &amp;ndash; speaks to Amir of &amp;ldquo;luxury, betterment, possibility&amp;rdquo;. The novel explores how her Aryan body is dealt with differently to the dark-skinned migrants, many of them destined for the sea floor, among the &amp;ldquo;million interlocking bodies who&amp;rsquo;d braved this passage before&amp;hellip; and come to rest at the bottom, sick with the secrets of their own unallowed mourning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel holds a mirror to the absurdity and cruelty of the EU migration system, while framing events in Europe against the vaster scale of disaster around the globe. As such, it is a meditation on human behaviour when pressed to its extremes: a study of universal relevance in which El Akkad weaves his tales while playing many roles, as Scheherazade does in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One Thousand and One Nights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: raconteur, provocateur &amp;ndash; and, ultimately, jurist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The results are in!</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoD is back in business!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
