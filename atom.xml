<p class="lead">Siggy has a very good essay up about a subject I care about: <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/atrivialknot/2022/05/05/video-essays-are-like-blogs-but-more-so/">Blogs vs. YouTube</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Blogging has been declining. I don’t have much evidence, aside from Google trends, but it’s fairly obvious from personal experience. For example, atheist blogs used to be a huge cultural force, with big celebrities and countless indie blogs, and now it’s sort of a backwater with a few networks of marginal relevance, and a mostly dead indie space. And no other blogosphere has replaced what atheist blogging once was.</p>
<p>Maybe his just has to do with my personal circles? As a reality check I tried looking up the question. I learned, according to Google, that blogging is bigger than ever, and is still a great way to make money by advertising your product! Okay, so I should specify that I’m not interested in all blogs, because marketing blogs can go die in a fire. I’m talking about personal blogs, and more specifically essay blogs. Essay blogs are declining, that’s what I meant.</p>
<p>Essays aren’t dead though, because it is now popular to present essays in video format. The video essay is a booming genre, and I for one think it’s great, for the same reason essay blogs are great.  But there are also some significant differences.</p></blockquote>
<p>They make a lot of good points, but I’d add that the barriers to entry for video essays are much higher. Sure, you can do some of it on the cheap, witness all the cell phone camera videos, but the big timers have production skills and are deploying good lighting and even sets. There are also new presentation skills you have to know — being able to speak quickly and smoothly is not a universal ability. I know I’m more comfortable taking an hour or two to write than just getting in front of a camera and talking for 10 minutes. I also don’t have to put on makeup to write something over coffee (not that I put on makeup for any of my videos).</p>
<p>I’ll also disagree with Siggy on one thing: drama is not more difficult on YouTube. In some ways it’s worse. Take some right-winger who is good at just spewing noise and doesn’t bother to actually research what they say (say, Sargon, or Steven Crowder, who make gobs of money on noise), and they can generate lots of drama, much of it consisting of guys yelling at each other. Tim Pool and Alex Jones are nothing but masturbatory auto-generated drama! I manage to avoid much of it by the simple expedient of favoring videos that are under a half hour long. While there are some people who are really good at long format, in-depth conversations, the most successful people on YouTube seem to be cheesy motormouths who can yammer for hours, usually about gossipy trash-talk, or squeaking as they play video games. If you aren’t putting in more time to research what you’re going to say than in saying it, you probably aren’t worth listening to.</p>
<p>Also, one thing the two approaches have in common is they’ve both been saddled with the most hideous names. Blog? Vlog? Bletch.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the decline of blogs, I’d argue, is the efforts of the big services to concentrate control in their hands. When blogs were big, we were using RSS readers and news feeds, which were distributed mechanisms for customizing and personalizing access. Now everybody is at the mercy of The Algorithm, whatever that is, and goes to a centralized site like YouTube that uses their software to guess what you’d like to see, and often guesses wrong.</p>

    <title>The corruption is next door. Wake up!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/05/10/the-corruption-is-next-door-wake-up/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/church.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/church-121x150.jpg" alt="" width="121" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-66495" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/church-121x150.jpg 121w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/church-243x300.jpg 243w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/church-768x950.jpg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/church-500x619.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/church.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Conservatives are desperately trying to change the subject. They want to avoid talking about their potential success in banning abortion and instead whine about those naughty leakers who exposed an imminent Supreme Court decision, or point fingers at protesters who stand peacefully outside the homes of Supreme Court justices, shaming them. They&amp;#8217;d rather not discuss their actions to criminalize women&amp;#8217;s health, something they&amp;#8217;d been working towards for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADF (Alliance Defending Freedom, an evangelical Christian organization, and today&amp;#8217;s grand misnomer) was crowing about &lt;a href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/adf-plans-first-trimester-abortion-restrictions-then-total-bans-as-it-fights-roe-in-the-courts/"&gt;getting here four years ago&lt;/a&gt;.  They figured that the election of Donald Trump had opened the gates and they were going to get everything they wanted. They were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a plan to make Roe irrelevant or completely reverse it,” said Kevin Theriot, vice president of ADF’s Center for Life. Denise Burke, senior counsel at ADF, said that she is “really excited” about the strides that are being made to “eradicate Roe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a strategic plan, that is a comprehensive, start-to-finish, from when we’re considering legislation all the way up to the Supreme Court, to challenge Roe,” said Burke. Among the reasons for ADF’s optimism is the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and so many Trump nominees to the federal appeals courts, which ADF believes will lead to courts granting approval to state laws further restricting access to and ultimately banning abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t a one-off surprise at all. It&amp;#8217;s everything they aspire to. Listen to Jerry Falwell brag that he&amp;#8217;d been working on revoking women&amp;#8217;s rights for 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MalsOLSFvX0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They (I&amp;#8217;ll get to who &amp;#8220;they&amp;#8221; are in a moment) aren&amp;#8217;t done yet.  &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/05/roe-abortion-miscarriage-crime-murder-prosecution/"&gt;Miscarriage shall be a crime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a humid morning in early October, Brittney Poolaw sat in an Oklahoma courtroom waiting on a verdict. Instead of the jail uniform she’d donned over the past 18 months, she wore a yellow and white blouse. After less than three hours of deliberation, the jury returned with their decision: Poolaw was guilty of first-degree manslaughter. She was sentenced to four years behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Poolaw, a 20-year-old and a member of the Wichita Tribe, had not driven recklessly or shot a gun. She’d had a miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At least&lt;/em&gt; one in four pregnancies end in a miscarriage &amp;#8212; it may be as high as one in two. You probably know women who have had miscarriages while trying to have a baby (I know of several, personally). Now imagine them thrown in jail for it. Imagine them being accused of manslaughter. This is what they want, and it&amp;#8217;s just the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; want to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/08/abortion-tate-reeves-mississippi-contraception/"&gt;ban contraception&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) on Sunday refused to rule out the possibility that his state would ban certain forms of contraception, sidestepping questions about what would happen next if Roe v. Wade is overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;ve already started. A Louisiana law bans IUDs and IVF, and calls these acts of, not manslaughter, but homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;People have highlighted the fact that the Louisiana abortion bill (arguably) bans IUDs and IVF, but can we talk about the fact that it says that any federal law or court ruling protecting abortion is null and void and that any state judge who overturns it will be impeached? &lt;a href="https://t.co/2ABNk51PtR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2ABNk51PtR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ethan Corey (@EthanSCorey) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EthanSCorey/status/1523339036026454016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really have to look at that law&amp;#8217;s provisions to lock this act into existence, without any possibility of ever being overturned. It&amp;#8217;d be hilarious if it weren&amp;#8217;t so evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any federal statute, regulation, treaty, executive order, or court ruling that purports to supdersede, stay, or overrule this Section shall be in violation of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Louisiana and is therefore void.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to the powers granted to the Legislature by Article X, Part III, of the Constitution of Louisiana, any judge of this state who purports to enjoin, stay, overrule, or void any provision of this section shall be subject to impeachment or removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; are like children, and they have even grander plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governor of &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/05/04/gov-greg-abbott-supreme-court-case-requiring-education-undocumented-children/9652463002/"&gt;Texas want to stop educating kids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gov. Greg Abbott wants Texas to challenge a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that requires states to offer free public education to all children, including those lacking legal immigration status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ruling, known as Plyler v. Doe, struck down a Texas law that had denied state funding to educate children who had not been &amp;#8220;legally admitted&amp;#8221; to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been averting our eyes and lying to ourselves for decades. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; couldn&amp;#8217;t possibly be this bad, could they? It&amp;#8217;s just a few people posturing for their constituents or their congregation, they couldn&amp;#8217;t possibly succeed, and you&amp;#8217;re probably looking at the ominous possibilities that those danged liberals bring up, saying &amp;#8220;Nah, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; can&amp;#8217;t ban contraception, they can&amp;#8217;t destroy the public school system, they can&amp;#8217;t take over the government, they can&amp;#8217;t establish a theocratic state, it&amp;#8217;ll never happen,&amp;#8221; and like always, it&amp;#8217;s always easier to reassure ourselves that it can&amp;#8217;t happen here than to act to prevent it from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/05/roe-abortion-miscarriage-crime-murder-prosecution/"&gt;an uncompromising philosophy&lt;/a&gt; that requires them to do everything possible to control &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…as Dana Sussman, deputy executive director of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, says: “Not only did Roe vs. Wade establish that there’s a constitutional right to abortion, it also rejected the idea that fetuses are people under the Constitution.” The draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, is steeped in language that paints fetuses—no matter what stage of development—as people. And when we lend credence to the idea of fetal personhood, it creates “a situation in which, when there is perceived harm to a fetus, it can be a victim of a crime. You can’t add fetuses to the community of individuals who are entitled to constitutional rights without diminishing the rights of the person carrying that fetus,” Sussman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evil idea is nonsense, unsupported by science. A person does not magically appear at the instant of conception; it&amp;#8217;s not black or white, no baby, then &amp;lt;blink&amp;gt; baby. Fetal development is a progressive process that takes a single cell with all the autonomy of a shed speck of dander to a squirming infant over the course of months, and at the expense of the mother&amp;#8217;s body and work…and that only begins years of responsibility to make it an independent person. They&amp;#8217;ve absorbed this lie that full human beings are created at conception and that a fetus therefore has all the rights that its mother has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this foolishness come from? Here&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/08/abortion-tate-reeves-mississippi-contraception/"&gt;a clue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue has also prompted Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, the House’s lone antiabortion Democrat, to clarify his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My faith will not allow me to support a ruling that would criminalize teenage victims of rape and incest,” Cuellar said in a recent statement. “That same faith will not allow me to support a ruling that would make a mother choose between her life and her child’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s their faith, their religion. Ironically, the Christian Bible doesn&amp;#8217;t even take the absolutist position &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; do &amp;#8212; these beliefs don&amp;#8217;t come from a god, but from generation after generation of male prophets and preachers &lt;em&gt;interpreting&lt;/em&gt; their holy book to say what they desire it to say, and endorse their possession and control of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that tells you who &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are. They are not The Other, they are not outsiders, they are not freakish cultists. They live among us. They are your aunts and uncles, parents and cousins. They&amp;#8217;re your neighbors. Look around your community &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s guaranteed to be pockmarked with a diverse assortment of churches, protected to an excessive degree by the law, given freedom from taxation or any kind of regulation, thriving like unchecked cancers in every town. Some of them are filled with decent people who care about civil rights for everyone, but in others…right now, at this instant, they are celebrating a new era of oppression, and are planning to elect more town council members, more school board members, more representatives and senators, more people who will tell everyone else that they must obey, they must follow, they must do as they&amp;#8217;re told. Women will serve, gay people will be punished, miscegenation must be eradicated, children will be indoctrinated, everyone must accept that &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; beliefs, no matter how ridiculous, are Truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are us. These oppressive laws are not built on a secular or rational foundation, they are entirely the product of peculiar religious beliefs of a minority that we&amp;#8217;ve encouraged to flex and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insanity is going to continue on. We can fight back and elect better representatives, kick out some incompetent judges, pass laws that, for instance, end those screaming masses outside women&amp;#8217;s health care clinics, but ultimately the solution has to be … tax the churches. End the special privileges given to religion. Stop the politicization of the pulpit. You want to endorse politicians, lobby for more restrictive laws, campaign against the heathen? You aren&amp;#8217;t a church, you&amp;#8217;re a Political Action Group, and should be regulated in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring back separation of church and state. Acknowledge that freedom of religion is one thing, a good thing, but that abuses of that freedom are the root cause of our current damnation. Educate our children about reality as we can see it, not blind mythology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deep fakes: the new front in the disinformation wars</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5965/deep-fakes-the-new-front-in-the-disinformation-wars#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/zelensky_lecturn.jpg" height="1281" alt="President Zelensky was the target of a deep fake video" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In a media landscape in which the truth often seems to get lost in noise and disinformation, the increasing use of deepfakes is a particularly worrying trend. Synthetic video content &amp;ndash; that is, video which is wholly or partly generated by artificial intelligence &amp;ndash; has been in widespread use since at least 2017. Until now, however, it has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/7/20902215/deepfakes-usage-youtube-2019-deeptrace-research-report"&gt;largely been used&lt;/a&gt; for non-consensual pornography, targeting women by using their likeness without their consent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;This year, this developing technology &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60780142"&gt;has been weaponised&lt;/a&gt; in the Russia-Ukraine war. In March, a deepfake video was released, apparently showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons. It was unsuccessful. After the TV channel Ukraine 24 was hacked so that its website displayed the video, Zelensky was alerted and posted a Facebook video explaining that it was a fake. Twitter and YouTube were quick to announce that they were tracking and removing the video where it was being shared, as it breached their rules on deceptive synthetic media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;However, as a &lt;a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/09/05/campaigns-must-prepare-for-deepfakes-this-is-what-their-plan-should-look-like-pub-79792"&gt;playbook for defeating deepfakes &lt;/a&gt;that the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace released in 2019 put it, while digital fakery can, for now, be detected pretty easily, &amp;ldquo;People have a visceral reaction to video and audio. They believe what their eyes and ears are telling them &amp;ndash; even if all signs suggest that the video and audio content is fake.&amp;rdquo; Since that report, artificial intelligence has advanced, substantially increasing the realism of deepfakes and cutting the resources required to create them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;How do we face this coming tide of disinformation? New technology is part of the picture. In late 2020, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) &lt;a href="https://governmentciomedia.com/darpa-launches-new-programs-detect-falsified-media#:~:text=The%20Defense%20Advanced%20Research%20Projects,falsified%20media%2C%20such%20as%20deepfakes."&gt;launched a Media Forensics programme&lt;/a&gt; to develop new prototypes to identify and combat falsified media. They use detection algorithms, which analyse media content to determine if manipulation has occurred; and fusion algorithms, which combine information across multiple detectors to create an &amp;ldquo;integrity score&amp;rdquo; for each media asset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But as Nina Schick, author of &lt;em&gt;Deepfakes: The Coming Infocalypse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepfakes-porn-politics"&gt;pointed out recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; magazine, &amp;ldquo;our crisis of information will not be for technology to solve alone. Any technological solutions will be useless unless we humans are able to adapt to this new environment where fake media is commonplace.&amp;rdquo; This will require &amp;ldquo;inoculation&amp;rdquo; through digital-literacy and awareness training, along with concerted action from government, military and civil groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;We need to prepare now for this rising threat to our information eco-system. At the moment, it is relatively easy to spot deepfake videos. As the recent video of Zelensky shows, such fakes can be countered with a prompt response. But as technology advances, it is only a matter of time before we will need additional tools and strategies in order to distinguish a deepfake from the real thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a3-a7 a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a-all a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Will the killing of a schoolteacher have any effect on Pakistan's blasphemy laws?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5966/will-the-killing-of-a-schoolteacher-have-any-effect-on-pakistans-blasphemy-laws#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>

According to the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies, &lt;a href="https://crss.pk/blasphemy-cases-in-pakistan-1947-2021/"&gt;at least 89 citizens &lt;/a&gt;have been murdered in killings related to blasphemy cases since Pakistan was established in 1947. There were five last year alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Even against this grim backdrop, the &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dga85/woman-teacher-killed-blasphemy-dream-pakistan"&gt;recent murder of Safoora Bibi,&lt;/a&gt; a teacher at an all-girls religious school in Pakistan, is striking for its particularly horrific nature and the rarity of the killers being women: a female colleague and two of the victim&amp;rsquo;s former students have been accused. The girls told police that a relative dreamed that Bibi had committed blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad. Police are investigating whether the killing was in fact related to a personal feud. This is often at the root of blasphemy allegations in Pakistan, since the potential punishment is so high and the burden of proof so low (accusers can even refuse to repeat the alleged blasphemy for fear of blaspheming themselves).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Last December, Priyantha Kumara, a Sri Lankan general manager of a garment factory in Sialkot, a city in Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s Punjab region, was &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/3/sri-lankan-factory-manager-lynched-and-set-on-fire-in-pakistan"&gt;bludgeoned to death by a mob&lt;/a&gt; after reportedly removing posters that had sections from the Koran written on them. Many people, including the president of the local chamber of commerce, maintain that Kumara was in fact targeted by his factory&amp;rsquo;s workers over a personal grudge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;According to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, about &lt;a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2019%20Pakistan%20Blasphemy.pdf"&gt;80 people in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; are in prison for blasphemy, with at least half facing a life sentence or death. There have been no executions since the moratorium on the death penalty 14 years ago. However, there is some evidence that the death penalty emboldens ordinary citizens to carry out vigilante killings in Pakistan. Some of the goriest mob lynchings occurred after the moratorium was introduced. Perpetrators of these vigilante killings are rarely brought to justice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Whatever the motive of the women who killed Safoora Bibi, attacks based on blasphemy accusations look set to continue. With Pakistan mired in a broader political crisis after Imran Khan was ousted, a change to the law is not on the agenda: in the last 15 years, politicians who proposed reform have been threatened and even killed. As long as the country has some of the strictest blasphemy laws in the the world, we will continue to see innocent people murdered by their fellow citizens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a3-a7 a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a-all a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Turning our backs on the vulnerable</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5964/turning-our-backs-on-the-vulnerable#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Ukrainian women and children refugees at a checkpoint" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ukranian_women_and_children.jpg" height="695" alt="Ukrainian refugees at a checkpoint" width="1043" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It is increasingly obvious to the British population, and the world at large, that the UK government is going out of its way to avoid its moral and international obligations towards refugees. On 27 April, the Nationality and Borders Act finally passed through parliament, despite evidence that it risks criminalising asylum seekers and denying their right to reunion with their families already in the country. Meanwhile, the Homes for Ukraine scheme &amp;ndash; through which individuals, charities and business can sponsor refugees fleeing the Russia-Ukraine war &amp;ndash; has grabbed headlines while falling behind on targets, as Ukrainians struggle to actually obtain the visas required, with many of the spare rooms offered remaining empty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The immigration bill had been stuck in parliament since last July, and to force it through the government dropped one of the more controversial aspects: the so-called &amp;ldquo;push-back&amp;rdquo; policy that would allow the UK to stop asylum seekers in the Channel and send their dinghies back to France. However, the new legislation still penalises refugees entitled to asylum in the UK for having reached the country via &amp;ldquo;illegal&amp;rdquo; means. The government has repeatedly claimed that the aim is to crack down on people-smuggling gangs and to prevent deaths at sea. However, they were&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/fury-as-patels-borders-bill-found-misleading-on-safe-routes-for-migrants"&gt; forced to admit &lt;/a&gt;in April that the bill contained no provision for safe and legal routes for asylum seekers into Britain. Therefore this argument appears to be disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Thus far, &lt;a href="https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/bond-and-over-150-organisations-lobby-government-to-scrap-cruel-rwanda-asylum-plan.html"&gt;160 charities and campaign groups&lt;/a&gt; have branded the bill &amp;ldquo;shamefully cruel&amp;rdquo;. The UNHCR, meanwhile, has raised concerns that the law will undermine the Refugee Convention, along with Britain&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;longstanding global cooperation on refugee issues&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Particular concerns have been raised over the new legislation allowing for the removal of refugees to other countries. Some critics have questioned the feasibility of the &amp;pound;120 million deal with Rwanda for offshore housing of asylum seekers, given the legal challenges such a scheme is likely to face. But the possibility of such a development has prompted outrage. The move has been seen as further evidence of Britain seeking to abandon its international obligations, and to shirk its ethical responsibility to provide safe refuge to people fleeing war and persecution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Meanwhile, a whistleblower working for the Homes for Ukraine scheme &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/homes-for-ukraine-whistleblower-says-uk-refugee-scheme-is-designed-to-fail"&gt;has claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the policy was &amp;ldquo;designed to fail&amp;rdquo;, in order to limit the numbers of Ukrainians entering the country. Announced in the Commons as advancing Britain&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;long and proud history&amp;rdquo; of supporting the most vulnerable &amp;ldquo;in their darkest hours&amp;rdquo;, the scheme was criticised from the start for requiring asylum seekers toapply for a visa. This bureaucratic process &amp;ndash; in which people are sometimes expected to travel hundreds of miles to passport or visa offices &amp;ndash; drastically limits and slows a process intended to aid victims of war who may be in immediate danger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The Refugee Council has &lt;a href="https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/homes-for-ukraine-scheme-refugee-council-response/"&gt;expressed concern &lt;/a&gt;about the prospect of housing traumatised people with individuals who had not been through any robust checks or training, while it&amp;rsquo;s still unclear what will happen to refugees after the six-month stint with sponsors comes to an end. This latest whistleblower leak, claiming that the system was designed to &amp;ldquo;keep the numbers down&amp;rdquo;, seems to confirm suspicions that limitations aren&amp;rsquo;t a bug, but rather a feature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Taken in the round, the least cynical of observers might conclude that the UK government&amp;rsquo;s priority is simply to keep refugee numbers low. Thus far, appeals to moral and international commitments have been ignored, as has the opinion of the British public, whose views in a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/migrants-asylum-rwanda-boris-johnson-b2058114.html"&gt;recent YouGov poll&lt;/a&gt; showed the majority opposed the Rwanda deal, with 27 per cent &amp;ldquo;strongly opposed&amp;rdquo;. So much for Britain&amp;rsquo;s much-trumpeted &amp;ldquo;long and proud history&amp;rdquo; of providing refuge for the vulnerable &amp;ndash; at least where the current government is concerned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Don’t take offense at the Salem Hypothesis!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/05/09/dont-take-offense-at-the-salem-hypothesis/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Every time I mention the Salem Hypothesis, as I did in <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/05/07/something-is-wrong/">recent video</a>, I get a bunch of complaints from engineers that <em>they</em> aren’t creationists. I know. Most engineers are not creationists, or even necessarily prone to creationism. That’s not what the Salem Hypothesis says.</p>
<p>Here’s what <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Salem_Hypothesis">RationalWiki</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Salem Hypothesis is the observation of an apparent correlation between the engineering trade and creationist beliefs (possibly due to crank magnetism, this can also include climate-change denial and other crackpot beliefs).</p>
<p>The hypothesis suggests that people who claim science expertise, whilst advocating creationism, tend to be formally trained as engineers (with the possible exception of chemical engineers).</p>
<p><strong>This hypothesis does not address whether engineers tend to be creationists (the converse)</strong>; however, it has been speculated that engineering predisposes people to a creation-science view.[citation needed]</p>
<p>There is some evidence that this characterization of respected members of the esteemed engineering profession can actually be extrapolated out to fundamentalism and quackery of all kinds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/03/salem-conjecture.html">Larry Moran and Bruce Salem</a> explaining further.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/Bruce_Salem.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/Bruce_Salem-122x150.jpeg" alt="" width="122" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-66489" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/Bruce_Salem-122x150.jpeg 122w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/Bruce_Salem.jpeg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px"/></a>The Salem Conjecture was popularized by Bruce Salem on the newsgroup talk.origins. It dates to before my time on that newsgroup (1990) and I haven’t been able to find archives to research the exact origin. The conjecture was explained by Bruce on numerous occasions, here’s a statement from Sept, 5, 1996.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My position is not that most creationists are engineers or even that engineering predisposes one to Creationism. In fact, most engineers are not Creationists and more well-educated people are less predisposed to Creationism, the points the statistics in the study bear out. My position was that <strong>of those Creationists who presented themselves with professional credentials, or with training that they wished to represent as giving them competence to be critics of Evolution while offering Creationism as the alternative, a significant number turned out to be engineers</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I know it’s subtle, but it’s not attacking engineers, it’s saying that <em>creationists who claim scientific authority</em> often turn out to be engineers, and not at all qualified.</p>
<p>I’d add a corollary: if they’re not engineers, they often turn out to be MDs or dentists.</p>
<p>Anyway, I also got email from an engineer who understood the distinction.</p>
<blockquote><p>My name is [redacted] and I am a Mechanical Engineer and graduate from Michigan State University. I am not a creationist, but I did find out I was working with at least 2 young earth creationists. In a building of ~15,000 people at the former FCA/Chrysler headquarters that isn’t surprising. It was my first exposure to such ideas in person. My circle of friends/coworkers couldn’t believe someone had those ideas.</p>
<p>After watching some of your discussions I see they all seem to use the same tactics. I’d use their numbers for the Grand Canyon v Mount St. Helens river carving time and their numbers would work out to make the Earth older than 6,000 years, so they’d jump to a different topic without admitting the error. They’d deny evolution say it was never observed. I’d tell them about MSU’s long running evolution project in the physics building so off to another topic, then another ad nauseam. </p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to give you at least a data point to help offset the Salem hypothesis. I wonder what makes us lean toward creationism, odd. Honestly, it’s kind of sad, as I got into engineering because I wanted to know how the real world actually works. I cant imagine chaulking it up to a sky daddy and not thinking about it. </p></blockquote>
<p>Just for laughs, though, here’s a <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/the-salem-hypothesis-is-true-and-thats-great-for-id/" rel="nofollow">creationist who thinks the Salem Hypothesis is just great</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Perhaps the reason that engineers are more likely to be critical of evolution, is because evolution actually is more of a question of engineering than biology, as it deals with the development of the most intricate, purposeful systems available. Thus, the field of study most likely to be able to correctly analyze this question would, in fact, be engineers.</p></blockquote>
<p>See? Not knowing anything about biology is an advantage for certain kinds of engineers who want to pontificate on evolution.</p>

    <title>Book review: What Strange Paradise</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5955/book-review-what-strange-paradise#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-07-at-15.01.46.jpg" height="758" alt="What strange paradise" width="942" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Along the far end of the port of Lesbos, I watch two Afghan boys push battered mountain bikes against a wind that drives in from the water, past a military vessel emblazoned with an EU flag. Farther out at sea, the forms of violence &amp;ndash; from the elements or at the hands of those commanding such vessels &amp;ndash; being delivered to others like these boys are difficult to think about. Yet it is into just such a world that Omar El Akkad draws us. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Set on an unnamed Aegean island, as well as in Egypt and on the fickle waters in between, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;What Strange Paradise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; traces the journey of a young Syrian boy across the Mediterranean to Europe. Nine-year-old Amir inadvertently finds himself aboard a smuggler&amp;rsquo;s rickety vessel in Alexandria whose wreckage is ultimately washed up on a European beach. The novel is structured into interlacing chapters of before and after, which recount Amir&amp;rsquo;s hazardous passage and the similarly perilous adventure following his arrival.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Central to the latter is the novel&amp;rsquo;s other key protagonist, the teenage Vanna: a second-generation northern European migrant whose family owns a failed guesthouse on the tourist-laden island. It is Vanna who first encounters Amir after his apparent brush with death. She becomes his accomplice in a mission to deliver him from the hands of the local police and asylum system to the mainland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;It is a Manichean world of azure sunlit beaches and blackened nights on a tormenting sea, where those seeking safety are ruthlessly exploited by smugglers and then rounded up at gunpoint by the authorities on arrival. Yet it is illuminated by individual acts of solidarity and heroism. El Akkad&amp;rsquo;s portrait of contemporary asylum-seeking &amp;ndash; its violence, mercilessness and tedium, relieved by flashes of altruism &amp;ndash; gives the uninitiated vivid insight into the realities of what is commonly called the EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;migrant crisis&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, the opening passage in which Amir&amp;rsquo;s small body lies prostrate in the sand is an obvious reanimation of the image of the Kurdish toddler Alan Kurdi, whose tiny corpse unleashed a tide of global attention when it appeared in 2015. Yet El Akkad simultaneously plays with the boundaries of social realism, stretching them such that the story takes on a fable-like hue. It is unsurprising then that the author expresses a love of alchemy in writing, describing the book as a repurposing of the tale of Peter Pan: Vanna the young Wendy on the threshold of adulthood and escapism, and Captain Hook manifest in the novel&amp;rsquo;s steely Colonel Kethros, who, with his amputated leg, doggedly pursues the two children across the island.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The novel is thus also distinctly cinematic, populated by archetypes (the villainous smuggler, the conflicted young officer, the maternal Muslim woman) and driven by fast-paced action and pithy dialogue. At times, this dynamic can feel on the verge of trite. Kethros suffers from PTSD from military service in the Balkans, but this background of trauma is underdeveloped, while the fable-like simplicity in parts of the novel sits at odds with the nuances of its realism elsewhere, such as Vanna&amp;rsquo;s complex relationship with her distant mother. Nonetheless, the novel is interwoven with truths of such universal resonance, told with poignancy, that the reader often pauses between lines. Most resonant is El Akkad&amp;rsquo;s characterisation of the human relationship to place and to those perceived as outsiders. Vanna&amp;rsquo;s body, for example &amp;ndash; with its white skin, blue eyes and blond hair &amp;ndash; speaks to Amir of &amp;ldquo;luxury, betterment, possibility&amp;rdquo;. The novel explores how her Aryan body is dealt with differently to the dark-skinned migrants, many of them destined for the sea floor, among the &amp;ldquo;million interlocking bodies who&amp;rsquo;d braved this passage before&amp;hellip; and come to rest at the bottom, sick with the secrets of their own unallowed mourning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel holds a mirror to the absurdity and cruelty of the EU migration system, while framing events in Europe against the vaster scale of disaster around the globe. As such, it is a meditation on human behaviour when pressed to its extremes: a study of universal relevance in which El Akkad weaves his tales while playing many roles, as Scheherazade does in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One Thousand and One Nights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: raconteur, provocateur &amp;ndash; and, ultimately, jurist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How do we warn future generations about our toxic waste?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5958/how-do-we-warn-future-generations-about-our-toxic-waste#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-07-at-16.16.58.jpg" height="811" alt="Martin Rowson illustration" width="1252" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;With the world edging towards climate catastrophe, it is small wonder that many countries are once again looking at nuclear power. The reason is obvious: a plentiful source of energy with no direct CO2 emissions provides a clear route to helping the world reach its emissions targets.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It is not without serious risks, of course, as the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island meltdowns demonstrate. But to focus only on present-day dangers is to miss the larger problem, for nuclear waste remains radioactive for at least 10,000 years. And because we can&amp;rsquo;t simply banish it from this earth by blasting it into space, where it might contaminate the atmosphere, we have to store it somewhere, to be left undisturbed. That raises the question of how we tell people, ten millennia from now, where we&amp;rsquo;ve put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking to the future is a &amp;ldquo;blind spot&amp;rdquo; for humans, says Vincent Ialenti, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Southern California and The Berggruen Institute, and author of &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Time Reckoning: How Future Thinking Can Help Earth Now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &amp;ldquo;We have ancient brains, and are focused on shorter time spans, like 24-hour news cycles or quarterly earnings. Many of us, through social media, are even stuck in fast-paced, dopamine-modulating information echo chambers.&amp;rdquo; If this short-termism makes thinking about the future hard, then the prospect of communicating with someone 10,000 years from now likely feels far beyond our capacities.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;One issue is the language we would communicate in: there&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee that English, Spanish or Mandarin will exist long into the future. &amp;ldquo;Languages evolve faster than that, or they die out,&amp;rdquo; Ialenti explains. &amp;ldquo;Try reading &lt;span class="s1"&gt;Beowulf&lt;/span&gt; in Old English. That was only written down about 1,000 years ago, in an earlier form of the same language we&amp;rsquo;re speaking now. And it&amp;rsquo;s incomprehensible.&amp;rdquo; Even more so, perhaps, think how little the word &amp;ldquo;internet&amp;rdquo; would mean even to someone living in the 1970s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures are out of the question, too. &amp;ldquo;Take a skull and crossbones,&amp;rdquo; Ialenti says, widely used to indicate poisonous substances. &amp;ldquo;In some cultural settings, that means rebirth. In others, it means death. In others, it just means pirates. So, what&amp;rsquo;s it going to mean in the future? Signage can change as fast as language. Before the Second World War, the swastika had a totally different meaning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know whether past civilisations tried to speak to us in the present. What we do know is that if they did, their efforts were not immediately discernable. This could either be through misunderstanding or simply a tendency to dismiss the knowledge of our ancestors, rather than embracing their wisdom. &amp;ldquo;There are oral stories about lost islands and ancient sea rises in Australia, passed down for 10,000 or so years by Aboriginal Australians, that have been corroborated by climate research,&amp;rdquo; Ialenti says. &amp;ldquo;And guess what? The colonial administrators didn&amp;rsquo;t listen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;&amp;lsquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;s work in England&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;There are other instances, too. &amp;ldquo;Along the coast of Japan, there are centuries-old &amp;lsquo;tsunami stone&amp;rsquo; slabs that read &amp;lsquo;High dwellings are the peace and harmony of our descendants. Remember the calamity of the great tsunamis. Do not build any homes below this point&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; Yet a nuclear plant was still built in a tsunami zone in coastal Fukushima, and these messages were only left a few hundred years ago &amp;ndash; barely 5 per cent of the timespan a nuclear waste warning would need to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This poses another issue: the durability of the message itself. Weathering has made stone tablets and ceramics as little as 1,000 years old indecipherable, while the metals that are most likely to survive exposure to wind and rain, such as gold and silver, are also the ones most likely to be stolen. In the 1990s, Sandia National Laboratories &amp;ndash; tasked with investigating safe methods of disposing of the United States&amp;rsquo; nuclear waste &amp;ndash; attempted to solve this problem by devising large monoliths as a warning, suggesting the US government build &amp;ldquo;menacing earthworks&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;landscape of thorns&amp;rdquo; with concrete spikes designed to give a sense of fear and foreboding.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yet these more abstract messages don&amp;rsquo;t always work either. &amp;ldquo;Look at Stonehenge,&amp;rdquo; Ialenti says, citing archaeologist Rosemary Joyce&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Future of Nuclear Waste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;In 1599, the poet Samuel Daniel described it as a &amp;lsquo;huge, dumb heap&amp;rsquo;. One hundred years later, Isaac Newton believed it was an antecedent of Solomon&amp;rsquo;s Temple. In the early 19th century, William Blake called it &amp;lsquo;Satan&amp;rsquo;s work in England&amp;rsquo;. Today, you have the UNESCO World Heritage perspective. We have to be cautious: a monument doesn&amp;rsquo;t project the same meaning throughout eternity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such challenges mean that many countries have simply decided to avoid the problem of future warnings altogether. In Finland, experts concluded it could be more strategic to avoid building monuments to warn future generations about its Onkalo waste repository, due to become operational sometime in the mid-2020s. &amp;ldquo;The Finns didn&amp;rsquo;t do any of those imposing American constructions,&amp;rdquo; Ialenti says. &amp;ldquo;They plan to put their nuclear waste repository on a resource-poor islet in Western Finland, backfill it, not mark it, and try to intentionally forget about it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And yet, given the scale of the problem when it comes to communicating with the future, it&amp;rsquo;s small wonder the dilemma posed by nuclear waste has encouraged scholars to think outside the box &amp;ndash; perhaps, it might be argued, a little too far outside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Myth, ritual &amp;ndash; and radioactive cats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;In 1980, the US government assembled a panel of experts to talk to the future. Since the Second World War, nuclear waste from reactors had been amassing around the world. It was buried underground or otherwise disposed of at the bottom of the sea, presenting an invisible and deadly threat of radiation poisoning to anyone nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The panel, named the Human Interference Taskforce, included an archaeologist, a psychologist, a long-term climatologist and experts in verbal and non-verbal communication. It was tasked with finding ways to warn people millennia from now of the waste, and to prevent them from accessing it. In 1984 the taskforce reported back. Their solutions were, to put it mildly, imaginative. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;One of the taskforce&amp;rsquo;s most prominent members was linguist Thomas Sebeok, a specialist in non-human communication. In addition to his contributions to the official report, he also wrote an independent report in 1984, &amp;ldquo;Communication Measures To Bridge Ten Millennia&amp;rdquo;, which considered messages that had successfully survived across thousands of years, from folklore, legend and religion. He proposed keeping the uninitiated away from nuclear repositories through creating false narratives, drawing on the tools of myth and ritual. These secrets would then be entrusted to a select group of experts. &amp;ldquo;A ritual annually renewed can be foreseen,&amp;rdquo; Sebeok wrote, &amp;ldquo;with the legend retold year-by-year (with, presumably, slight variations). The actual &amp;lsquo;truth&amp;rsquo; would be entrusted exclusively to &amp;ndash; what we might call for dramatic emphasis &amp;ndash; an &amp;lsquo;atomic priesthood&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were major problems with the idea, Sebeok admitted: first, no culture in human history had ever attempted such a massive con as creating a fake, government-sponsored religion to scare off trespassers. It would also create a ruling class, further fragmenting human society between those with knowledge and those without. And, finally, the only examples where false narratives had been spread &amp;ndash; such as the idea of a curse to protect Pharoah burial sites in Egypt &amp;ndash; had either been completely ignored or served as encouragement to tomb raiders. &amp;ldquo;I can see an archaeologist being like, okay, [a curse] makes it ten times more interesting!&amp;rdquo; jokes Ialenti. &amp;ldquo;Sometimes frightening aesthetics just draw people in even more. I mean, people listen to heavy metal music all the time, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebeok&amp;rsquo;s idea was included in a poll of alternative ways to communicate messages about nuclear waste storage, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Zeitschrift f&amp;uuml;r Semiotik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Journal of Semiotics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Also featured were two other concepts that deserve special mention.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The first was from semioticians Fran&amp;ccedil;oise Bastide and Paolo Fabbri, who proposed deliberately forgetting the locations to prevent a disparity of knowledge in society. Instead, they advocated creating a biological marker to detect &amp;ndash; and avoid &amp;ndash; radiation. Cats, the duo argued, had been domesticated by humans for thousands of years but had no discernible purpose. Bastide and Fabbri advocated selectively breeding cats so that their skin changed colour when in contact with radiation, thereby serving as a warning to humans to leave.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;Such an animal species should dwell within the ecological niche of humans,&amp;rdquo; the duo wrote, &amp;ldquo;and its role as a detector of radiation should be anchored in cultural tradition by introducing a suitable name (for example &amp;lsquo;ray cat&amp;rsquo;) and suitable proverbs and myths.&amp;rdquo; Sadly, the ability to breed Geiger-counter felines does not exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Captain Picard's flute&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The final idea of note was by Polish science fiction writer Stanisław Lem, the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Solaris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. At first, he suggested creating &amp;ldquo;information plants&amp;rdquo;, grown near atomic sites, whose DNA code could be deciphered to reveal the dangers present. But this idea was convoluted &amp;ndash; it assumed adventurers would sequence the plants&amp;rsquo; genetic code, or that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cross-fertilise and spread beyond the initial area. Lem&amp;rsquo;s second idea was far simpler: to create satellites that could orbit the Earth, transmitting stored information. In effect, he was proposing to create an external hard drive for the planet, backing up human knowledge in case of disaster, such as a nuclear war.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This idea of a &amp;ldquo;back up&amp;rdquo; is already being explored. It&amp;rsquo;s inspired science fiction, such as &amp;ldquo;The Inner Light&amp;rdquo; featured in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, where a probe sent from a dying world fires an energy beam that strikes Captain Picard, transmitting to him the memories of a person&amp;rsquo;s life. Far from having ill intent, the probe is simply a message into the future, hoping that a long-destroyed culture is remembered. Through Picard, something as simple as how to play a flute was preserved.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s this kind of legacy that the Arch Mission Foundation, a US non-profit hoping to preserve human knowledge, is aiming to deliver. &amp;ldquo;There are a lot of risks outside of our control on our planet: nuclear threats, biological threats, pandemics and the dangers of misinformation,&amp;rdquo; explains Matthew Hoerl, the organisation&amp;rsquo;s co-founder and executive director. &amp;ldquo;But there&amp;rsquo;s no comprehensive backup for our knowledge &amp;ndash; it all exists on flash drives, hard drives or the cloud. If something were to happen, it would be gone like that. And we feel it&amp;rsquo;s important to record our existence for the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project has already gone extra-terrestrial in its efforts to create an archive for humanity: in 2019, it sent its Lunar Library to the Moon on board an Israeli lander, with a complete copy of the English &lt;span class="s1"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/span&gt;, photos, relics and a vault of the secrets to magician David Copperfield&amp;rsquo;s tricks, stored on optical data discs.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer the most important question: how do you make sure your message survives? &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee it can,&amp;rdquo; Hoerl admits. &amp;ldquo;There are two issues: the message and the format. The bigger the message, the more it needs to be compressed, which makes it increasingly difficult to decode. Future beings won&amp;rsquo;t have a copy of Windows! So we&amp;rsquo;ve identified ultra-durable storage formats that are analogue, so the message can be viewed with very limited decoding. In the beginning, the message is viewable through simple magnification: even a few drops of water is enough. It includes a full Rosetta Stone of 327 languages and an instruction manual on how to build a microscope. So, as long as some language survives, we hope the message in the archive can be reconstructed in that way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Messages in molecules&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;And yet it could be another branch of science &amp;ndash; chemistry &amp;ndash; that already holds the answer to how humans can speak through the millennia. Scientists know that large molecules can only be formed through interaction with a biological entity; that&amp;rsquo;s how they increase their molecular complexity. If you find a molecule that&amp;rsquo;s bigger than a certain size, therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s evidence that life must have existed. Carbon dioxide, for instance, could form without life on any planet in the universe; DNA could not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking this concept, Lee Cronin, a professor at the University of Glasgow, is examining whether we can use our knowledge of chemistry to leave messages for future generations that can&amp;rsquo;t exist in nature. Cronin has been working on reverse-engineering large molecules, working out how to send messages with them by chopping them up and using their constituent parts. &amp;ldquo;There will be common elements,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;common parts I use again and again, like Lego bricks.&amp;rdquo; By then analysing these molecules using standard techniques, such as mass spectroscopy, predictable chemical patterns and shifts can be made to occur, allowing you to use molecules as a form of code. &amp;ldquo;You can put in different messages, using different molecules.&amp;rdquo; &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This won&amp;rsquo;t help, Cronin concedes, unless you know that you are supposed to read the message. But he is also considering how humans could leave longlasting evidence of their presence &amp;ndash; not just of life on Earth, but of an advanced civilisation. &amp;ldquo;If life on Earth is about to be extinguished, I want to leave a warning sign on Earth for aliens,&amp;rdquo; Cronin says. &amp;ldquo;So, what could you do [with chemistry]? Well, what about leaving a molecule in the atmosphere, something that says &amp;lsquo;We were here&amp;rsquo;? You could take every element on the periodic table that forms a bond, and make a molecule out of it. Carbon, phosphorus, silicon, whatever, just daisy chain them together! You&amp;rsquo;d then have a huge macro-molecule, and the assurance that its discoverer will know that there&amp;rsquo;s no way that it was naturally occurring.&amp;rdquo;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;If this sounds outlandish, scientists are already capable of detecting just such a molecule on exoplanets thousands of light years away by using near-infrared telescopes. And once his &amp;ldquo;beacon&amp;rdquo; molecule has attracted attention, Cronin says, increasingly complex molecules next to it could be used to create and explain a cypher. &amp;ldquo;Essentially you could have molecules as decryption devices,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;You could write a relatively short chemical message, maybe a few thousand words, that would be visible from space using an infrared telescope.&amp;rdquo; With today&amp;rsquo;s technology, then, we could write a greeting in our atmosphere visible across the galaxy. The downside, however, is that such a message would take thousands of years to reach other stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not have a thousand years to solve this challenge. The advent of nuclear war and the pressing dangers of climate change mean that our civilisation is under greater threat than ever. If we survive, the least we can do is ensure that future generations don&amp;rsquo;t make our mistakes. But some remain pessimistic at the chances of this happening. &amp;ldquo;Human societies do not have the skills to communicate long term,&amp;rdquo; Ialenti concludes. &amp;ldquo;We still need to cultivate within ourselves a greater societal time-literacy, and that could take generations.&amp;rdquo; Until then, all we can do is try our best and hope someone, thousands of years from now, is listening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books.

Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
