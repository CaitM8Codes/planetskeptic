    <title>What kind of sick coward murders 14 children?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/05/24/what-kind-of-sick-coward-murders-14-children/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/24/school-shooting-uvalde-texas-updates/"&gt;mass shooting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said 14 students and a teacher were killed in a mass shooting at a school in the city of Uvalde on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott said Salvador Ramos, an 18-year-old Uvalde resident, entered the school with a handgun and may have been carrying a rifle. Inside the school, a gunman “shot and killed — horrifically, incomprehensibly” more than a dozen children and a teacher, said Abbott (R). The gunman is also dead, and it is believed that officers responding to the scene killed him, Abbott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is Texas, the response is not going to be sensible gun control. Instead, Attorney General Ken Paxton. wants to arm teachers. &lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt; guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Asked on Newsmax about his solution for school shootings, Texas AG Ken Paxton mentions arming teachers &lt;a href="https://t.co/3maBKJ7uR5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3maBKJ7uR5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/05/24/patriarchy-poisons-everything/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;This is Franklin Graham, evangelical leader of the Southern Baptist convention, son of Billy Graham, &lt;em&gt;yesterday&lt;/em&gt;, the 23rd of May. He&amp;#8217;s got his priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’M CALLING ON MCDONALD’S TO BRING BACK THE FRIED APPLE PIE IN AMERICA! I just arrived in Sheffield, UK, where I’ll be preaching this week &amp;amp; my 1st stop was—you can guess where—their local &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/McDonalds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@McDonalds&lt;/a&gt;! Yes, I had my Quarter Pounder with cheese—&amp;amp; of course a fried apple pie. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GHvTXpJa2t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GHvTXpJa2t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Franklin_Graham/status/1528808009442414592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s somewhat surprising about this is that the day before, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2022/05/22/southern-baptist-sex-abuse-report/"&gt;Washington Post broke the news of a major scandal among the Southern Baptists&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#8217;d think this should be a 5-alarm crisis for the evangelical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention on Sunday released a major third-party investigation that found that sex abuse survivors were often ignored, minimized and “even vilified” by top clergy in the nation’s largest Protestant denomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of nearly 300 pages include shocking new details about specific abuse cases and shine a light on how denominational leaders for decades actively resisted calls for abuse prevention and reform. They also lied to Southern Baptists over whether they could maintain a database of offenders to prevent more abuse when top leaders were secretly keeping a private list for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report — the first investigation of its kind in a massive Protestant denomination like the SBC — is expected to send shock waves into a conservative Christian community that has had intense internal battles over how to handle sex abuse. The 13 million-member denomination, along with other religious institutions in the United States, has struggled with declining membership for the past 15 years. Its leaders have long resisted comparisons between its sexual abuse crisis and that of the Catholic Church, saying the total number of abuse cases among Southern Baptists was small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I don&amp;#8217;t think the campaign to bring back McDonald&amp;#8217;s fried apple pies is going to be an adequate distraction from the bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin, and the rest of the world, might want to &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22031737-final-guidepost-solutions-independent-investigation-report?responsive=1&amp;#038;title=1"&gt;read that 300 page report&lt;/a&gt;. It begins…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For almost two decades, survivors of abuse and other concerned Southern Baptists have been contacting the Southern Baptist Convention (“SBC”) Executive Committee (“EC”) to report child molesters and other abusers who were in the pulpit or employed as church staff. They made phone calls, mailed letters, sent emails, appeared at SBC and EC meetings, held rallies, and contacted the press…only to be met, time and time again, with resistance, stonewalling, and even outright hostility from some within the EC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our investigation revealed that, for many years, a few senior EC leaders, along with outside counsel, largely controlled the EC’s response to these reports of abuse. They closely guarded information about abuse allegations and lawsuits, which were not shared with EC Trustees, and were singularly focused on avoiding liability for the SBC to the exclusion of other considerations. In service of this goal, survivors and others who reported abuse were ignored, disbelieved, or met with the constant refrain that the SBC could take no action due to its polity regarding church autonomy – even if it meant that convicted molesters continued in ministry with no notice or warning to their current church or congregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a familiar story that we&amp;#8217;ve seen again and again. Women are harassed, they report the problem to a designated authority, said authority buries the report, the offenders continue to offend (maybe with the advantage of being reassigned to virgin territory), and the hierarchy responds to queries with &lt;q&gt;What? No, we don&amp;#8217;t have a sexual abuse problem. My files are empty of cases!&lt;/q&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ve seen it in the Catholic church, and also in smaller entities like the James Randi Educational Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the problem isn&amp;#8217;t religion. Maybe the real root of the problem is patriarchal social structures. We should start dismantling every organization that has a mob of men at the top, where processing reports of abuse is handled by a chain of men. That seems like a reasonable starting point to fixing an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative explanation: maybe Franklin Graham is right and the real problem is that McDonald&amp;#8217;s now bakes their apple pies, rather than frying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/McDonalds-Fried-Apple-Pie.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/McDonalds-Fried-Apple-Pie-500x406.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="406" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-66641" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/McDonalds-Fried-Apple-Pie-500x406.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/McDonalds-Fried-Apple-Pie-150x122.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/McDonalds-Fried-Apple-Pie-300x243.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/McDonalds-Fried-Apple-Pie-768x623.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/McDonalds-Fried-Apple-Pie.jpeg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>"Deep Deception" and policing without consent</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5970/deep-deception-and-policing-without-consent#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/deception.jpeg" height="636" alt="Deep deception" width="415" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;There was a blue notice on the desk. It said: &amp;ldquo;All police officers wearing plain clothes and all civil staff are required to display identification whilst in this building.&amp;rdquo; I guessed it was a salvaged official sign from a police building somewhere. But its presence on the welcome desk at this conference hall in central London was a symbol of defiance by a group of women and their supporters making a stand against inhumane state surveillance. Their slogan is &amp;ldquo;Police spies out of our lives&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The event was the book launch for &lt;em&gt;Deep Deception&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s authored by five women, Helen Steel (the only one to use her real name), Belinda, Alison, Lisa and Naomi &amp;ndash; all of whom gradually found out the men they thought were their partners were in fact undercover police officers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 20 years since these left-wing activists discovered and exposed how undercover police officers had been infiltrating their groups and having sexual relationships with many women for years. Though the practice goes back to 1968, these women were being spied on from the 1990s to the 2010s. Their boyfriends suddenly disappeared, sometimes leaving a note, often after having or possibly staging breakdowns, leaving their distraught partners worried for their wellbeing. In some cases they had fathered children and abandoned them too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Yet only now can we appreciate how much we don&amp;rsquo;t yet know about the scale of these operations, as the police have continued to withhold the names and numbers involved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Deception&lt;/em&gt;, told in chronological order, reads like a kind of overlapping thriller, as each woman is trapped by a man following a system of training that had clearly developed over years. They often had a van, so they could take you home and meet your friends. They often got themselves quite senior within the organisation, giving them access to membership lists. In some cases they were involved in the planning and carrying out of crimes. Then there were the clues that only in hindsight read like red flags: on first seeing their place, the women noticed their new boyfriends had very few possessions. The officers usually moved in with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Media coverage has too often been only interested in the salacious details of the sexual relationships. As Lisa observed, it was like the fascination with serial killers. What motivates them? Before &lt;em&gt;Deep Deception&lt;/em&gt;, Helen, Alison and their solicitor Harriet Wistrich had met the creative team planning a BBC drama inspired by the spycops story, but were deeply unimpressed by what emerged: Peter Moffat&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Undercover &lt;/em&gt;(2016), starring Adrian Lester and Sophie Okonedo, ended up being a love story about a black undercover officer who was still married to the radical lawyer he&amp;rsquo;d targeted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Alison spoke out at the time: &amp;ldquo;To give the impression that the undercover relationships that inspired this drama were based on reciprocal love &amp;ndash; where no other woman is being cheated on and lied to &amp;ndash; is to misrepresent the deceitful individuals involved, and to misunderstand the power dynamics and sexual politics that underpinned them.&amp;rdquo; In fact, by 1996, officers working in the SDS unit &amp;ndash; the Special Demonstration Squad &amp;ndash; were required to be married before deployment, to ensure they had an external life to return to. The undercover cops called the women activists they slept with &amp;ldquo;wearies&amp;rdquo;, as in wearisome. In February 2022, a report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct into the misogynist and sexist culture at Charing Cross police station in central London found that male officers used the same term to describe female officers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;As a journalist, reading &lt;em&gt;Deep Deception&lt;/em&gt; was like having a veil lifted from my eyes. So many of the stories I&amp;rsquo;d covered over my career turned out to have had a covert police operation involved in manipulating and entrapping activists: the McLibel case, for example, where a leaflet opposing McDonalds was later found to have been co-written by an undercover police officer, or the mass arrests of green activists at Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station before their protest had even begun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;As Lisa said at the book launch, there is real sadness for the lost decade or more when climate change activism was derailed by these operations, given the warnings now being issued by the UN&amp;rsquo;s IPCC. The ongoing public inquiry into covert policing is only expected to complete taking evidence in 2025. These women are determined not to let this scandal disappear under the weight of time. There is still a reckoning due, with those officers yet to retire, and a wider awakening for a nation that has been too complacent about the very British idea of policing by consent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A new college in Poland aims to produce a godly elite</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5969/a-new-college-in-poland-aims-to-produce-a-godly-elite#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/coakley.jpeg" height="887" alt="Orthodox church in Warsaw" width="1323" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Joanna Kos formed her relationship with God in her mid-teens. A friend took her to a prayer group outside of school hours, and in that room in a little corner of Warsaw, the schoolgirl&amp;rsquo;s life changed forever. Faith, she told me, brought her peace and gave her confidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Her classmates soon noticed a change in their friend. Most people in the school identified as Catholic, but none attended mass on a regular basis. Going to the local church, however, had quickly become a part of Joanna&amp;rsquo;s weekly routine. Although everyone respected her new devotion, there was a problem, she told me when I met her at a central Warsaw caf&amp;eacute;. She often felt excluded from debates around certain topics, like abortion or equal marriage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;When friends were talking about LGBT issues I was always just sitting and listening and wanting to understand them,&amp;rdquo; she told me. &amp;ldquo;Before, when I tried to join the conversation, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t heard. Everyone was like: &amp;lsquo;Okay just shut up,&amp;rsquo; a bit like: &amp;lsquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know anything.&amp;rsquo; Perhaps I didn&amp;rsquo;t, but I still wanted to understand their points of view, and I wanted to have that chance to speak too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Now 20, Joanna is a slight woman with mousy hair and delicate features. She moves thoughtfully, her voice quiet. &amp;ldquo;The implications were that because I was [a practising] Catholic, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the world, that I was stupid or naive.&amp;rdquo; That sense of being shunned by liberal classmates for her conservative values stayed with Joanna. When the time came to choose a place for further education, she told me she wanted to go somewhere that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel &amp;ldquo;sentenced to silence&amp;rdquo;. A new institution caught her eye, the Collegium Intermarium in downtown Warsaw: the brainchild of Europe&amp;rsquo;s most controversial ultra-conservative lawyers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Collegium Intermarium: producing a new European elite?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The doors of the privately funded college swung open in May 2021. The promise to prospective students was that the institution would uphold &amp;ldquo;classical values&amp;rdquo; and be an answer to the global &amp;ldquo;crisis of academic life&amp;rdquo;. But the group that established the academy, the Education for Values Foundation, has strong links to Ordo Iuris &amp;ndash; an opaque legal organisation that has influenced the rolling back of women&amp;rsquo;s reproductive rights in Poland and supported anti-LGBTQ+ measures. It has also rejected the Istanbul Convention, a treaty that seeks to end violence against women, on the grounds that the convention promotes so-called &amp;ldquo;gender ideology&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;At present, the Collegium Intermarium offers just one undergraduate course, in law. Joanna is one of only 17 undergraduates currently enrolled, although the college has plans to expand into business management. Arounda hundred more students are engaged in part-time postgraduate studies, in subjects ranging from NGO management to the art of debate and &amp;ldquo;family policy in local authorities&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In its essence, the Collegium Intermarium is an attempt to groom the next generation of ultra-conservative thinkers, lawyers and policy-makers. And the college has ambitions that reach beyond Poland: its website declares that it wants to educate the &amp;ldquo;elite of the intermarium countries&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Intermarium&amp;rdquo; is Latin for &amp;ldquo;between the seas&amp;rdquo; and refers to a swathe of central Europe that lies between the Baltic, Black and Adriatic Seas. The ultimate goal appears to be to draw students from these ex-communist countries, which might be seen as more conservative and in opposition to the &amp;ldquo;liberal west&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It would be easy to dismiss this budding institution as a niche project on the fringes of academic life. But to do so would be to underestimate the influence Ordo Iuris and its associates have already had on shaping Poland&amp;rsquo;s moral economy. The chairman of the college&amp;rsquo;s board, Jerzy Kwaśniewski, who is also the President of Ordo Iuris, has been explicit about this goal. He told Polish media last year that Collegium Intermarium graduates will &amp;ldquo;shape the politics, law and identity of Europe&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;The influence of Ordo Iuris&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The ultra-conservative beliefs of Ordo Iuris, and by extension Collegium Intermarium, appear to be very much in line with the government&amp;rsquo;s own vision of Poland and its future. Since the Law and Justice party, or PiS, returned to power in 2015, they have introduced a series of extremely conservative policies. The party, led by Jarosław Kaczyński, has relentlessly pursued a narrative that Poland is caught in a values war with the liberal west who have destroyed the &amp;ldquo;traditional family&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Reproductive rights are a key battleground. In 2020, abortion in Poland was effectively outlawed after the government-controlled Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the procedure was unconstitutional in cases of foetal abnormality as it amounted to a &amp;ldquo;forbidden form of discrimination&amp;rdquo;. Today, abortion is only available in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother&amp;rsquo;s life is considered to be in serious danger. At least two women have already died in Poland after being denied lifesaving care as a consequence of this ruling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The case was brought to the Constitutional Tribunal by 119 conservative parliamentarians. But for years, Ordo Iuris had been seeding the ground for the roll-back of women&amp;rsquo;s reproductive rights. In 2016 they drafted a law that proposed a near total ban on abortion. The legislation kickstarted the iconic &amp;ldquo;Black Protests&amp;rdquo;, where women and men took to the streets to defend human rights. Although parliamentarians ultimately rejected the bill, Ordo Iuris used its strong connections with PiS to keep the issue of abortion on the national agenda.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ordo Iuris has also influenced the rolling back of LGBTQ+ rights across Poland. It developed a &amp;ldquo;pro-family&amp;rdquo; document, the &amp;ldquo;Local Government Charter of Family Rights&amp;rdquo;, to defend the &amp;ldquo;values confirmed&amp;rdquo; in the Polish Constitution. According to the charter, these include the &amp;ldquo;protection of marriage, being a union of a man and a woman&amp;rdquo; and the right to protect children against &amp;ldquo;demoralisation&amp;rdquo;. The charter has now been adopted by 39 local authorities. Ordo Iuris denies that the charter is discriminatory, as it does not mention LGBTQ+ people specifically. But activists have described local authorities who have adopted the charter as &amp;ldquo;LGBTQ-free zones&amp;rdquo; where their values and rights are not respected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Some of the new legislation also appears to be in tension with European law. In January, Poland&amp;rsquo;s lower house, the Sejm, passed a bill influenced by Ordo Iuris that would make it harder for the children of LGBTQ+ people to obtain a Polish passport, a move that runs counter to the European Court of Justice&amp;rsquo;s December ruling that requires all member states to issue &amp;ldquo;an identity card or a passport to a child who is a national of that member state and whose parents are two persons of the same sex&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In contrast to many other European countries, a significant proportion of young people in Poland appear to support this shift to cultural conservativism. While there has been a steep decline in religious practice among younger generations, the pivotal 2015 election saw a shift to the right, with two thirds of voters between 18 and 29 voting for right-wing parties. Since then, ultra-conservatives in the country have been keen to capitalise on this trend and make young people central to their long-term ambitions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Family, religion and the "European tradition"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Sitting in his Warsaw apartment, twirling a cigarette gently between his fingers, Filip Ludwin seems to find it comical that some people think the Collegium Intermarium&amp;rsquo;s intentions are nefarious. The dean of the law faculty, Ludwin is keen to distance the institution from Ordo Iuris. &amp;ldquo;We are interested in conducting broad research in all fields of [social] science,&amp;rdquo; he told me, peering over his rectangular glasses. &amp;ldquo;It means we are open to all [social] scientific issues. Ordo Iuris is mainly interested in social issues that are connected with a concrete vision of society, and they advocate for that vision . . . the two institutions are partially similar but it&amp;rsquo;s important to underline the differences between them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Like most of Poland&amp;rsquo;s ultra-conservatives, Ludwin is well-groomed and polite. He thinks before he speaks, avoids religious arguments and has a talent for dancing around answers to difficult questions. He dislikes the term &amp;ldquo;ultra-conservative&amp;rdquo; and feels the aims of the Collegium Intermarium have been widely misunderstood. &amp;ldquo;From our point of view, lawyers are not only professionals, but they should also have a deep humanistic and classical background too . . . We don&amp;rsquo;t omit practical aspects of [legal] studies, but a part of what we would like to present to our students is a broad humanistic, historical and philosophical background.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yet the institution&amp;rsquo;s dedication to &amp;ldquo;creating an academic community deeply rooted in European tradition and culture&amp;rdquo; appears to be motivated by ultra-conservative thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Neil Datta, the Secretary of the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, has tirelessly been calling attention to Ordo Iuris and its affiliates for years. From his office in Brussels he has done ground-breaking work on Europe&amp;rsquo;s ultra-conservative network and the money supporting it. &amp;ldquo;Ordo Iuris is a revamped expression of the much older network of &amp;lsquo;Tradition, Family, Property&amp;rsquo;, or TFP, and if you go into the history of TFP what you will find is several decades of trying to create institutions to educate children and young people, so this is the latest iteration of the same tendency,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;What strikes me about the Collegium Intermarium, and what makes it stand out, is that Ordo Iuris is a much stronger organisation than previous TFP organisations in other countries, so there is more potential for it to take off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;TFP is a global Catholic organisation accused of operating like a cult. In 1995 and 1999, for example, it was on the French National Assembly list of cult-like movements. Founded in Brazil by Plinio Corr&amp;ecirc;a de Oliveira in 1960, the movement has deeply conservative views on abortion and equal marriage. It&amp;rsquo;s also highly critical of relatively liberal pontiffs such as Pope Francis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ordo Iuris says it has no connection to TFP. However, connections stretch back to 2001, when the Father Piotr Skarga Association &amp;ndash; a Catholic organisation that says it was &amp;ldquo;inspired&amp;rdquo; by TFP &amp;ndash; founded the Father Piotr Skarga Foundation, which in turn created Ordo Iuris in 2013. Curiously, the Father Piotr Skarga Association, TFP and Ordo Iuris all use the same gold lion logo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Datta also points out that the Collegium Intermarium does not have to be particularly big to have a significant impact on European society. &amp;ldquo;When you look at the College of Europe in Belgium, it&amp;rsquo;s known for producing future elites [who] then go into the European institutions. Their graduating class is around 200 to 300 even though it was established in the 1950s,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;It looks like the ambition of the Collegium Intermarium is to create such an elite institution.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Teaching the next generation of ultra-conservatives&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;In the United States, the Patrick Henry College is another institution with aims to produce an elite. Situated in Purcellville, Virginia, &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rsquo;s Harvard&amp;rdquo;, as it has been nicknamed, was the alma mater of several of Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s administration, including the former White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farah. It attracted a range of conservative teaching staff, including Dr Stephen Baskerville, who worked at the college as professor of government until 2019.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Baskerville, known for his book &lt;em&gt;A Gentleman&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Manners, Sex, and Ruling the World&lt;/em&gt;, is a controversial figure, accused of making homophobic statements during his tenure at Patrick Henry College, and criticised for appearing alongside white supremacist activist Richard Spencer in 2013. Despite the conservative and Christian leanings of Patrick Henry College, Baskerville says he felt that his opinions were being stifled in the United States. Around this time, Ordo Iuris called to offer the 64-year-old a job as the head of state studies at the Collegium Intermarium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It was perfect timing, he told me. He had spoken at numerous conferences organised by Ordo Iuris and agreed with their worldview. &amp;ldquo;I felt like [in] the fields which I was publishing in, and the fields that I was teaching in, there were increasing demands to include political ideologies in the substance of what I was doing,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;This was necessary for career advancement or simple survival. It was very clear that people who did not subscribe to certain political ideologies were pushed to the margins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;I asked him whether political ideologies were evident at Collegium Intermarium, where he has been teaching Joanna and her classmates for the last year. He answered that it was hard to say what the views of his students are, as he doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;see the classroom as a place to express personal opinions&amp;rdquo;. The irony is that while the representatives for the Collegium Intermarium are quick to wax lyrical about academic freedom and open debate, all of its teaching staff appear to share the same ultra-conservative views. Many are ardent supporters of PiS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Ordo Iuris, meanwhile, has close links to the government. The group&amp;rsquo;s former president and co-founder Aleksander Stępkowski is currently the spokesperson for the Polish Supreme Court. Poland&amp;rsquo;s Minister of Culture Piotr Glinski and Minister of Education Przemyslaw Czarnek both attended the Collegium Intermarium&amp;rsquo;s launch event in 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Most of the ultra-conservatives I spoke to in Poland were keen to paint themselves as advocates of free speech and the victims of a liberal purge. Their voices weren&amp;rsquo;t heard, they said. The doors to global corridors of power were closed to them. Their anger at this state of affairs was palpable despite their polite exteriors. They apparently saw themselves not as dangerous ideological crusaders, but as human rights defenders and the guardians of Europe&amp;rsquo;s traditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It was a more developed version of how Joanna Kos felt in high school when she was excluded from lunchtime conversations because of her Catholic beliefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a conservative revolution happening in Poland, especially among young people,&amp;rdquo; says Milosz Hodun from the progressive NGO Liberal International, who is concerned about the college and the future impact of its alumni. &amp;ldquo;A lot of this is about educating the next generation of voters and giving them the skills to compete with the elites of other EU member states.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Not a day has gone by since her first class in October that Joanna has regretted her decision to enroll in the Collegium Intermarium. Her classmates are interesting and kind, she tells me. The teaching staff are accommodating, and she feels free to voice her opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;So will Joanna, with her law degree, go on to become a member of the new ultra-conservative elite in Poland, a new army of lawyers able to influence the direction of Europe? The future is uncertain, although she has already considered joining Ordo Iuris after she graduates. &amp;ldquo;Maybe I will, maybe I won&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Undoubtedly yes, and we should fight that as we would any other kind of fascism. Could we build a decarbonised world that not only replicates but exacerbates inequalities and human rights abuses endemic in our current fossil fuel economy? Again, it&amp;rsquo;s all too easy to imagine...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cashless conspiracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything is going digital, even money. But as &lt;strong&gt;Brett Scott&lt;/strong&gt; argues, we should be a little suspicious of the drive to stop us using &amp;ldquo;dirty cash&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And much like the missionaries who express incredulity that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to go to heaven, these firms think it&amp;rsquo;s outrageous that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to ascend to &amp;ldquo;the cloud&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; their world of hyper-connected and hyper-global digital markets that are supposed to free us from &amp;ldquo;inconvenience&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;friction&amp;rdquo;...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cynical saviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Corporations increasingly claim to back progressive causes. &lt;strong&gt;Carl Rhodes &lt;/strong&gt;explains how capitalism "going woke" is a threat to our democracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The implications for the future are considerable, as the democratic tradition that values equality, freedom and debate between participating citizens becomes over-whelmed by a corporate voice drown-ing out others in its soundbite-sized version of self-serving morality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fight for genetic justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cells of Henrietta Lacks were harvested without her consent and have proved vital to medical research. &lt;strong&gt;Semmi W. &lt;/strong&gt;talks to the Lacks family, who are suing one of the biotech companies making use of the cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was only in 1975 that the family discovered the fate of the cells, which had been harvested from tumours in Henrietta&amp;rsquo;s womb.

    <title>For the love of reason</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5959/for-the-love-of-reason#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Steven Pinker giving a lecture for Humanists UK (Wikimedia Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Steven_Pinker.jpg" height="835" alt="Steven Pinker" width="1252" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Steven Pinker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a tour de force training manual on how to think. Lessons in logical deduction, in avoiding cognitive biases and probability blunders, and in how to recognise fallacies all provide stimulus for vital mental spring-cleaning. Not merely instructive, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rationality&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is also an affirmation of many of the most fundamental humanist commitments: the simple beauty of the recursive nature of reason, the indispensability of rationality to deliberative democracy, the celebration of science, ethics and law as the greatest achievements of human rationality.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;aspires to do more than just explain, define and describe its eponymous concept. Its full subtitle asks not just &amp;ldquo;What [rationality] is&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;Why it seems scarce, Why it matters&amp;rdquo;. And it isn&amp;rsquo;t a utopian tract, arguing for human beings as perfect rational actors who go astray only when manipulated or misled. In many forms, Pinker says, rationality is counterintuitive &amp;ndash; we often need to engineer it. So, bookending the chapters that deal with the many aspects of the nature of rationality is Pinker&amp;rsquo;s most urgent call: to understand that rationality does matter, that it needs defending, and that we must advance it.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s focus is a natural extension of the Canadian-American&amp;rsquo;s inquiries to date. As a public intellectual and committed member of the humanist movement &amp;ndash; as well as a cognitive psychologist and psycholinguist &amp;ndash; Pinker&amp;rsquo;s work, especially his 2011 book &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(2018), has argued consistently and forcefully for the importance of science, reason and humanism to the advancement of our species. As Chief Executive of Humanists UK, I was especially keen to discuss the book with Pinker &amp;ndash; particularly the idea, as he summarised it to me, that &amp;ldquo;good things only happen as a result of human ingenuity and reason deployed toward humanistic goals&amp;rdquo;. I enthusiastically agree. But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to entice someone like me to embrace and celebrate the case for rationality. What about those who are not yet convinced, who may be the very people fighting for social change?&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the reasons that I&amp;rsquo;m active in the humanist movement,&amp;rdquo; he tells me, &amp;ldquo;is I think we can provide reasons why some goals are better than others by pointing out how they are consistent with other values that virtually everyone claims to believe.&amp;rdquo; Yet for Pinker&amp;rsquo;s aim of advancing rationality to be meaningfully fulfilled, it does seem to me that we must do more than rationally point out the inconsistencies in the thinking of others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Making use of myth?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Towards the end of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Pinker classifies beliefs into two types. The first belong in our &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; mindset. We arrive at and sustain these beliefs by reasoning about facts in our direct experience: water will boil at 100 degrees; cooking food will make it edible and nourishing. As these examples imply, beliefs of the reality type are also those that are essential to our everyday lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beliefs of the second type &amp;ndash; those in our &amp;ldquo;mythology&amp;rdquo; mindset &amp;ndash; operate in a different zone. They relate to the worlds beyond our direct experience: the long ago, the far away, the metaphysical. The functions of these beliefs are different from the beliefs in our reality mindset, and broader. They provide entertainment, moral lessons, a sense of meaning, social solidarity and more. Conspiracy theories, superstitions, comforting falsehoods, religions and tribalisms all live in our mythology mindset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As inheritors of the enlightenment tradition, committed to its dynamic continuation, we are duty-bound &amp;ndash; so &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; argues &amp;ndash; to make sure that as many of our beliefs as possible fall into the &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo; mindset. But I realised, reflecting on the book, that my own commitment to rationality has a considerable amount of the mythological about it.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I remember the first time I read a legal judgement. I can recall the admirable clarity with which the judge assessed the evidence presented to her. The arguments lawyers had made were considered, and &amp;ndash; step by logical step &amp;ndash; a judicious conclusion was reached. I found the experience of reading her words enormously satisfying. I didn&amp;rsquo;t just regard the rationality of her process as an effective way of getting to the truth. I felt a sort of pleasure as the judgement unfolded and took shape. At the end, I felt an aesthetic appreciation at something having been done properly.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It reminded me of my favourite work of theatre, Aeschylus&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Oresteia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Its final scene is an enactment of the first ever court, presided over by the goddess Athena, where adversarial truth-seeking justice replaces blood guilt and vengeance. Written two and a half millennia ago, it depicted the mythical world of centuries before that, providing an inspiring origin story for rational adjudication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Thinking about that scene and the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Oresteia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; brings to mind what Einstein said about the Greeks, that they were the first to &amp;ldquo;overcome man&amp;rsquo;s insecurity before himself and before nature&amp;rdquo; and the first who &amp;ldquo;wrought a system of thought whose conclusions no one could escape&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a beautiful way of describing both the art of reasoning and its profound consequences. What the broadcaster and humanist Jacob Bronowksi called this Greek &amp;ldquo;assertion of confidence&amp;rdquo; evokes the 20th-century scientific confidence that people like Bronowski and Einstein represent. I see the centuries-long chain of men and women who have carved out a space for truth and justice in an indifferent universe &amp;ndash; their effort, their commitment, their inspiring struggle. In this timeless community, as the humanist philosopher Harold Blackham put it, &amp;ldquo;Nothing is exempt from human question. There is no immemorial tradition, no revelation, no authority, no privileged knowledge . . . which is beyond question because [it is] beyond experience and which can be used as a standard by which to interpret experience. There is only experience to be interpreted in the light of further experience, the sole source of all standards of reason and value, forever open to question.&amp;rdquo; Rationality is the golden thread that runs through so much that makes the human story vital and vivid in my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ll this may lack the sensuousness of Proust&amp;rsquo;s madeleine, but it&amp;rsquo;s plain that my own commitment to rationality at least in part resides in the category of mythological belief, a weaving together of all these narratives and more. This mythology even has its own magic. The three little words &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s be reasonable&amp;rdquo; always have the power to recall me to calmness. &amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; I think, &amp;ldquo;we should be reasonable. I was being unreasonable and overheated. I should stop that.&amp;rdquo; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to let Athena down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;This is very personal, but it is not merely by way of autobiography. I am not the only one whose most powerful motivations come from my &amp;ldquo;mythological&amp;rdquo; beliefs, nor the only person who is more likely to be rational if the case for doing so can be made more vivid and warm. So, to return to my question arising from Pinker&amp;rsquo;s new book: if we do need to find ways to promote rationality &amp;ndash; and it won&amp;rsquo;t do to just tell people it is fact-based and true &amp;ndash; should we make use of the mythology mindset, and not just the principles exhorted in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? I put this to Pinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do we want to have humanist preachers rolling back their eyes and pumping copies of Spinoza&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span class="s1"&gt;Ethics&lt;/span&gt; on the pulpit?&amp;rdquo; he responds. &amp;ldquo;Probably not.&amp;rdquo; But, he says, &amp;ldquo;we do need something. We are human. We are motivated by ideals, images, heroes. I think that is reasonable to the extent that we know how to bottle them so that they don&amp;rsquo;t infect our understanding of reality. If it&amp;rsquo;s a way to engage our emotions toward ends that we can justify on humanist grounds, then it&amp;rsquo;s probably wise, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a challenge that we ought to step up to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expressed the hope that this could be achieved through &amp;ldquo;mythologies&amp;rdquo;, but Pinker is much more comfortable with the idea that rhetoric will provide motivation: &amp;ldquo;Maybe we have to study the cases of successful political leadership and rhetoric that managed to engage people&amp;rsquo;s emotions toward goals that we all can best justify.&amp;rdquo; He singles out Martin Luther King, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barack Obama. &amp;ldquo;It is an art that I think probably requires a rare combination of talents &amp;ndash; intellectual and interpersonal and emotional. I do what I&amp;rsquo;m capable of doing, which is making the case. It ain&amp;rsquo;t Martin Luther King. But, you know, maybe it would inspire some future version of Martin Luther King!&amp;rdquo;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In fact, the prose of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; frequently inspires, and there are many passages that would qualify as required reading on any curriculum of &amp;ldquo;rationalist myth-making&amp;rdquo;, if such a thing were thought desirable after all. But I come to my next question, on advancing the case for rationality. In his book, Pinker argues that being rational has an image problem and that this is one cause of the current crisis of reason. To be rational is not seen as &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;; it&amp;rsquo;s an unattractive thing to aspire to. This may be true, but it&amp;rsquo;s not my biggest concern. Perhaps I am defeatist, but I have taken it as read that many people are going to behave irrationally a lot of the time and that rationality will never be the predominant fashion. What worries me most today is the possibility that the people most inspired by justice, equality and human dignity may be averse to the idea of rationality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Rationalism and social change&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Pinker takes aim in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; at what he sees as an unhelpful trend: that young people on university campuses are pursuing social justice while adhering to &amp;ldquo;fashionable academic movements&amp;rdquo; that &amp;ldquo;hold that reason, truth and objectivity are social constructions that justify the privilege of dominant groups&amp;rdquo;. Because the students aligned with these movements also, he says, believe that &amp;ldquo;western philosophy and science are parochial, old-fashioned, and naive to the diverse ways of knowing found across periods and cultures&amp;rdquo;, Pinker places them outside of the rational.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t think rationality is a parochial cultural product. But I do see that it can be preached in aid of the privilege of dominant groups, especially economically dominant ones, and I understand why the people Pinker is talking about feel that way.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The plea of &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s be reasonable&amp;rdquo; from friend to friend might annoy you in the instant, but it does no harm. Between colleagues who share a certain discipline it may be vital, recalling us both to a shared standard. But a plea to be reasonable in the context of the struggle for equality or justice has less palatable associations. I, the rational actor, am calling on you to bring yourself into line. The implication is that you are too emotional, perhaps overly demanding. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious why the suspicion arises that rationality works against the interests of the less powerful and the vulnerable. This is worrying, especially if we have a particular obligation to persuade those committed to humanistic goals that human reason is the way to realise their hopes. So I ask how we can make rationality appealing to those who promote social justice, democracy and human rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinker responds that it is rational arguments, not angry protestors, that have historically triggered social change, disputing the idea advanced by his campus radicals that progress is &amp;ldquo;a story of struggle, with the downtrodden rising up and overcoming their oppressors&amp;rdquo;. His general theory of social progress is that &amp;ldquo;the first domino [is] a reasoned argument&amp;rdquo;. A philosopher wrote a text or manifesto and &amp;ldquo;eventually the conclusion was absorbed into the conventional wisdom and common decency of a society, erasing the tracks of the argument that brought it there&amp;rdquo;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We agree, however, that rationality is not the only tool required to achieve moral progress and that, as the book clearly states, there is no iron law of history. Human societies are not laboratories and no firm conclusions can be drawn about what &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo;. Nonetheless, Pinker strongly prefers the rational argument theory. I am not so sure. Even the Enlightenment-soaked founding fathers of the US didn&amp;rsquo;t reason George III out of his malfeasance. They overthrew him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, Pinker does persuade me that we have a strong argument for convincing progressives of the importance of rationality to achieving social change. &amp;ldquo;The rights of the downtrodden, the oppressed and the less privileged ought to be fostered and I for one am not willing to say that&amp;rsquo;s an irrational argument, quite the contrary,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s ultimately a rational one, stemming from the principle of the equality of all humans. This itself is an inherently rational proposition, because it simply hinges on the fact that the pronouns &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo; have no logical status. The idea &amp;lsquo;Whatever I claim for myself, I have to grant to you equally&amp;rsquo; is just built into rational discourse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rationality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Pinker says much of the need to re-engineer our world for rationality, from working to valorise it in popular culture to building it further into our school curricula. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful manifesto: we do need to build and maintain resilient rationality-based institutions in every area of our common life. But I am left thinking that the main path out of our present difficulties may be the one that he expresses later &amp;ndash; and quite beautifully &amp;ndash; in our conversation. Putting rationality at the very heart of the case we make for our love and care for each other is what can in turn give rationality itself back its heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Deep fakes: the new front in the disinformation wars</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5965/deep-fakes-the-new-front-in-the-disinformation-wars#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/zelensky_lecturn.jpg" height="1281" alt="President Zelensky was the target of a deep fake video" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In a media landscape in which the truth often seems to get lost in noise and disinformation, the increasing use of deepfakes is a particularly worrying trend. Synthetic video content &amp;ndash; that is, video which is wholly or partly generated by artificial intelligence &amp;ndash; has been in widespread use since at least 2017. Until now, however, it has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/7/20902215/deepfakes-usage-youtube-2019-deeptrace-research-report"&gt;largely been used&lt;/a&gt; for non-consensual pornography, targeting women by using their likeness without their consent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;This year, this developing technology &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60780142"&gt;has been weaponised&lt;/a&gt; in the Russia-Ukraine war. In March, a deepfake video was released, apparently showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons. It was unsuccessful. After the TV channel Ukraine 24 was hacked so that its website displayed the video, Zelensky was alerted and posted a Facebook video explaining that it was a fake. Twitter and YouTube were quick to announce that they were tracking and removing the video where it was being shared, as it breached their rules on deceptive synthetic media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;However, as a &lt;a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/09/05/campaigns-must-prepare-for-deepfakes-this-is-what-their-plan-should-look-like-pub-79792"&gt;playbook for defeating deepfakes &lt;/a&gt;that the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace released in 2019 put it, while digital fakery can, for now, be detected pretty easily, &amp;ldquo;People have a visceral reaction to video and audio. They believe what their eyes and ears are telling them &amp;ndash; even if all signs suggest that the video and audio content is fake.&amp;rdquo; Since that report, artificial intelligence has advanced, substantially increasing the realism of deepfakes and cutting the resources required to create them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;How do we face this coming tide of disinformation? New technology is part of the picture. In late 2020, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) &lt;a href="https://governmentciomedia.com/darpa-launches-new-programs-detect-falsified-media#:~:text=The%20Defense%20Advanced%20Research%20Projects,falsified%20media%2C%20such%20as%20deepfakes."&gt;launched a Media Forensics programme&lt;/a&gt; to develop new prototypes to identify and combat falsified media. They use detection algorithms, which analyse media content to determine if manipulation has occurred; and fusion algorithms, which combine information across multiple detectors to create an &amp;ldquo;integrity score&amp;rdquo; for each media asset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But as Nina Schick, author of &lt;em&gt;Deepfakes: The Coming Infocalypse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepfakes-porn-politics"&gt;pointed out recently&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; magazine, &amp;ldquo;our crisis of information will not be for technology to solve alone. Any technological solutions will be useless unless we humans are able to adapt to this new environment where fake media is commonplace.&amp;rdquo; This will require &amp;ldquo;inoculation&amp;rdquo; through digital-literacy and awareness training, along with concerted action from government, military and civil groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;We need to prepare now for this rising threat to our information eco-system. At the moment, it is relatively easy to spot deepfake videos. As the recent video of Zelensky shows, such fakes can be countered with a prompt response. But as technology advances, it is only a matter of time before we will need additional tools and strategies in order to distinguish a deepfake from the real thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a3-a7 a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a-all a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!&lt;/p&gt;

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
