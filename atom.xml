<p>It’s next week, the damned will need to get their tickets soon. Of course it’s in Texas.</p>
<p>It’s a one-day event, noon until 10pm, and look at all those people! Everyone is crammed into panels so they can shout over each other, a crucial part of being in Hell. They seem to have simply drafted a bunch of otherwise unknown nobodies from social media; I especially like the ones who don’t even go by an identifiable name, like Nuance Bro and Andrew, just Andrew, and oooh, Spectre. Spooky. They seem to have no qualifications other than a follower count and reliably regressive opinions.</p>
<p>You know, once upon a time I was one of those guys in great demand to appear at conferences, but then I became Mr Unpopular practically overnight because I spoke out against a rapist. I suppose I could have been there if only I’d abandoned human decency and all of my principles to be part of that mess, like a Peter Coffin (who is also going to be there.)</p>
<p>At least I can attend <a href="https://skepticon.org/">Skepticon</a> without any regrets…and yes, it’s happening this year, July 29-31, <em>in person</em> in St Louis. Look for a real announcement from the organizers sometime soon, but keep that weekend open.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Will-Davies-photo.jpg" height="365" alt="Will Davies" width="442" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor William Davies is a sociologist and political economist at Goldsmiths University in London. He has written widely on neoliberalism, happiness science, environmental politics and anti-expert politics. His latest book, "&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/unprecedented"&gt;Unprecedented? How COVID-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy&lt;/a&gt;" (Goldsmiths Press), authored by Davies, Sahil Jai Dutta, Nick Taylor and Martina Tazzioli, was published in March.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book, which you wrote together with colleagues from the Goldsmiths Political Economy Research Centre, makes clear that Covid has given greater clarity to several striking and uncomfortable truths about the workings of the British state and its economy: the central role played by a &amp;ldquo;shadow state&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;contract rentiers&amp;rdquo;; the shape and geography of inequality here. You&amp;rsquo;ve studied political economy and statecraft for decades. What, if anything, has struck you as especially remarkable over the past two years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One thing that&amp;rsquo;s been astonishing is that an economy that had long been organised around housing, as a driver of inequality, a focal point of macroeconomic policy and a cultural obsession, was able to become even more so, to the point where one now has to recognise that houses and households are the pivotal institution of British capitalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean this in a number of ways. Firstly, Covid-19 saw yet more house price inflation internationally, caused by the asset-purchasing programmes of central banks and a stamp duty holiday in the UK. But, by virtue of the injunction to &amp;ldquo;stay home&amp;rdquo; and the rapid expansion of digital platforms over the previous decade, "home" became a place of work, education, consumption, entertainment and retail. It also hugely intensified certain political dynamics of households, in terms of where financial surpluses and deficits occurred, and crucially where surpluses and deficits of time in the household occurred. In financial terms, this is evident in how certain households built up huge savings over the course of lockdowns, seeing as their opportunities to spend suddenly disappeared, whereas others fell more deeply into debt. But the issue of time was also significant: certain people (those furloughed, without children or caring responsibilities) found themselves with unprecedented levels of free time, to bake bread or watch Netflix, whereas others were under intense pressure to juggle responsibilities arising from home-schooling and home-working. Evidence shows graduate mothers were doing more work in the evenings and at night than any other demographic. None of these processes is entirely new, but they have been ramped up even further over the last two years. What we don&amp;rsquo;t know is what the longer-term legacies of (what we term in the book) &amp;ldquo;hyper-domestication&amp;rdquo; will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the UK &amp;ndash; both the government and the public &amp;ndash; responded as you would have expected?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Nobody knew what a policy response to such an event would look like, though one could have guessed that central bank asset-purchasing would be part of the mix, as so many economies in the Global North were already addicted to these policies. Beyond this, however, the last two years has been an astonishing revelation of what governments are actually capable of. Firstly, there is the use of their own balance sheets to borrow and spend, without raising the cost of borrowing, something that was deemed impossible for the previous decade. This paid for the furlough scheme, something that was also unimaginable only a few weeks before it was unveiled, but could now reshape how we think about welfare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there were the various local interventions. The Everyone In scheme, which initially aimed to get 5,000 people off the streets, but had by May 2021 moved 37,500 people into Covid-secure housing. The designation of &amp;lsquo;essential worker&amp;rsquo; status (for instance in terms of whether an employee&amp;rsquo;s child was offered a school-place) demonstrated that it is possible for policy-makers to distinguish social value, something that neoliberal intellectuals have spent a century denying. Even in schools, where things were very tough for teachers, they acquired a level of autonomy and demonstrated a service to local communities that teachers and unions have long argued for, but which have always been dismissed by central government and the press. In all these ways, the unthinkable became thinkable. &lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it about the particular nature of the pandemic itself, as opposed to other crises, that lent it what you describe as a &amp;ldquo;photosynthetic&amp;rdquo; function, &amp;ldquo;feeding tendencies that already existed, while also illuminating them&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This is a very interesting issue. We adopted the metaphor of "photosynthesis" because we recognised that the pandemic isn&amp;rsquo;t just an ordinary economic crisis. In many ways, it exacerbates tendencies that were already there (as in the example of the household economy and housing), but by virtue of it affecting everybody, had a powerful political effect in raising consciousness and visibility of these tendencies. Crises aren&amp;rsquo;t always like this. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was the biggest of its kind since the 1930s, and yet if you owned your own home, were retired, or employed in a senior position, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really hit you much. Thanks to policy choices, the costs were pushed towards the young, public sector workers, local government and those dependent on local government. The politics of the pre-Covid decade was shaped by these divergent experiences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Covid, some got rich out of it, many died, and nobody could entirely ignore it. It had a clarifying and politicising effect, the consequences of which I suspect we&amp;rsquo;ve not yet seen. The type of state, labour market, care infrastructure, society were unavoidable matters of concern, across ages, classes and geography. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One point the book makes early on, when discussing the cronyism in government around the awarding of Covid-related contracts, is that proximity to the British state &amp;ndash; if not the Conservative Party itself &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;now represents a business model&amp;rdquo;. Is this a marked change in the nature of government-to-business relations in the UK? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I think there were three things going on here. The first is that the British state has been a source of revenue for a whole industry &amp;ndash; public service outsourcing &amp;ndash; since the late 1980s. This has been well-documented by the likes of CRESC and Brett Christophers, who classifies &amp;ldquo;contract rentiers&amp;rdquo; as one of the major forms of rentiership at the heart of British capitalism. When a Minister has a major policy problem, you can count on two hands the possible consultancy firms and service providers who they will turn to to solve it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the post-Brexit Conservative Party and Johnson leadership is evidently far more relaxed about helping its donors and friends, from positions of power. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exaggerate the purity of British politics pre-Johnson, but we know that the state operates in a more clientelist way than it did only a few years ago, as is often associated with &amp;lsquo;populist&amp;rsquo; regimes. The third is that the emergency of Spring 2020 and onwards clearly deepened this tendency, as exhibited by the &amp;ldquo;VIP Lane&amp;rdquo; that was discovered through which Covid contracts were awarded without usual procurement procedures. So again, something &amp;ldquo;photo-synthetic&amp;rdquo; occurred, in that features of the British state that had become sedimented over the previous 30 years &amp;ndash; and others that were features of the past five years &amp;ndash; were suddenly thrown into the limelight, and amplified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also make the point that one of the great tragedies of the pandemic is the priority accorded to the nation and to national policy-making. Why is this to be lamented? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Because the pandemic is a singularly global event. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to conceive of anything that could have brought so many people, across so many national and cultural boundaries, into such simultaneity like this. That is a consequence of jet travel, and it is the first airborne pandemic since jet-based business travel and tourism engulfed the entire globe. That it has also occurred in the context of the internet and social media adds to the intensely global sensibility that it has generated, much as Benedict Anderson wrote of how &amp;ldquo;print capitalism&amp;rdquo; enabled the rise of nations in the 18th century, by bringing members of large territories into a single chronology of experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Responses would ideally be global as well, in terms of vaccination and protection of the vulnerable. Instead, we saw what Adam Tooze has described as an &amp;ldquo;Olympics of national governance&amp;rdquo;, in which each nation pursued its own distinctive path. I guess this had benefits from an experimental point of view, but it also saw drastic escalation of border controls, with dire consequences for refugees, and some frankly racist hierarchies of which nations were perceived to pose greatest risk to others. As Tooze has argued, none of this bodes well for the larger global crisis of climate breakdown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book notes the central role played by data and data platforms in critical decision-making processes around the Covid-19 response. How does this transform state power?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Data, in its 21st century digital form, has been crucial to pandemic responses in societies such as the UK. This is true for the somewhat botched track-and-trace system, in which the Covid-19 app, venue check-ins and ubiquitous QR codes became an attempt at rolling out surveillance. This was met with considerable hesitancy, made worse by anxieties surrounding the use of NHS data, meaning that the system never really delivered. In countries that experienced SARS, such as South Korea, such platform-based surveillance was far more advanced, with considerably greater state enforcement. Vaccine roll-out was enabled by data analytics provided by firms such as the controversial Palantir. Then there is the ongoing question about what access data and AI firms might attain as part of their services to the NHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These public-private partnerships are unlike many outsourcing contracts, as they grant private platforms and data analysts a form of sovereignty over us, not only in terms of surveillance, but in terms of making crucial decisions over our movements and freedoms. The geographer Louise Amoore has identified this in relation to electronic borders, operated by what she terms an &amp;ldquo;consultocracy&amp;rdquo;, that is, power and decisions in the hands of IT service providers. The capacity to sustain certain forms of movement and market, under exceptional conditions, is conditioned by the handing over of powers once unique to the state, into the hands of commercial data analysts. This is why companies like Palantir provoke such unease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The whole experience has polarised many over the question of public vs. state power. Anti-vaxxers and anti-mask wearers, often but not always rather &amp;ldquo;anti-state&amp;rdquo; in their orientation, are derided as selfish and self-sabotaging; those who comply with the rules are conversely seen as complicit in supporting a widening of state and para-state powers. Was there ever a safe middle line to tread between personal health and personal freedoms?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I think there was, but one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t become too seduced by hindsight. We can all look back on some of the excesses of lockdowns (closed playgrounds, bans on sitting down in parks) and wonder what the hell was anyone thinking. But there was intense fear at the time of something entirely novel. Nobody in a position of expertise was advising in favour of moderation, because the great fear was the situation witnessed in Lombardy, of hospitals completely overwhelmed. I think children&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing, education and longer-term prospects should have received far more attention and priority, but that reflects as much on warped generational priorities as anything else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As someone who was writing widely, long before the pandemic, on various manifestations of state overreach, how have you, in your own day-to-day life, grappled with this tension between accepting measures that are intended to protect public health &amp;ndash; mask wearing, handing over of high volumes of personal data, tighter border controls &amp;ndash; and relinquishing of personal freedoms? How have you thought this through and reasoned with its outcomes? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It's extremely difficult, because I have sufficient confidence in the scientists advising the government, and even sufficient confidence in many senior figures in the government, to accept that measures were introduced according to the best balance of evidence that they could come up with at the time. We know that measures were introduced too late in Britain in March 2020, and that had they been introduced sooner, then deaths would have been fewer and freedoms restored sooner, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different issue. We were broadly living in a very fallible utilitarian experiment, never conducted before, and I don&amp;rsquo;t believe anyone knew with very much confidence what was the best way to make trade-offs. In that sense of real-time decision-making, with a lot of &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo;, it did resemble a wartime scenario. Some measures, such as mask-wearing, became overloaded with moral symbolism on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to remain sceptical, without falling into traps of conspiracy theory. The difference between scepticism and cynicism is not always easy to maintain, but one thing that is always worth doing is identifying and calling out those who are themselves acting cynically and opportunistically, including politicians, businesses and other elites, who have exploited a collective tragedy for their own benefit. The Left was also guilty of this at times, arguing for things that resembled a &amp;ldquo;left-wing&amp;rdquo; agenda in certain respects (such as &amp;ldquo;zero Covid&amp;rdquo;) but which failed to acknowledge the facts of Britain&amp;rsquo;s situation. The claim that because the government is a Tory one, it actively wants to kill people, or that schools should never have opened until Covid had disappeared entirely, is not a useful way of understanding things in my view.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Eternal cleaning of the spotted soul</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-07-at-14.27.52.jpg" height="843" alt="Rowson cartoon" width="1252" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In my early childhood days at a Catholic boarding school in Droitwich, there were some miraculous stories that had particular appeal. There was the wonderful one about Jesus feeding a multitude on five loaves and two fishes. And feeding them so well that, according to Mark, there was enough left over for 12 baskets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was the intriguing tale about how the Virgin Mary miraculously made her way into heaven. As the priest in charge of our daily Religious Instruction carefully explained, Mary couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply ascend to heaven in the same manner as Jesus because she was not actually divine. So instead of being forced like everyone else to go through the natural process of physical decay and death, she was bodily &amp;ldquo;assumed into heaven&amp;rdquo;. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the priests who took our RI lessons seemed willing or able to elaborate on the physics of this doctrine, but I remember my 10-year-old classmate, Rollason, suggesting one night in the dormitory that Mary must have been literally sucked up to heaven through the operation of something like a celestial vacuum cleaner. Whoosh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet none of these stories engaged my attention so firmly as the Catholic account of the vicissitudes of the soul, which, we were told, did not die with the flesh but was held in suspension until being reunited with the body at the final resurrection.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Souls, we learned, were rather special internal organs. They were all too readily contaminated and stained by sin, and these stains were so black and so deep that they could only be washed away by regular visits to the confessional. (This story gained some of its imaginative appeal from the manner in which it symbolically matched with the fate of a fellow pupil, Riley, who was banished from school because he had a potentially fatal spot on his lung.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All through those early childhood days the absolute cleanliness of my soul was of more immediate daily concern than other more evident bodily manifestations, such as the appearance of pubic hair and facial spots.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But keeping a soul clean was an arduous business. For although confession promised to sweep away one&amp;rsquo;s sins, a nasty sinful stain could reappear merely by the espousal of a single dirty thought. So while one could readily remove the big black stain left by masturbation with some post-confessional penance &amp;ndash; half-a-dozen Our Fathers and a few score Hail Marys was the usual tariff &amp;ndash; once out of the confessional box, even a brief pleasurable thrill at the erotic noise made by Matron&amp;rsquo;s nyloned legs as she patrolled the dormitory was enough to once again mar the purity of that ever-so-sensitive internal organ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;It was Freud, or at least my teenage acquaintance with Freudian psychology, that finally freed me from the tyranny of the constantly stained soul. The news came from Vienna that the real psychic battle was not between the cleanliness of one&amp;rsquo;s soul and the ever-present allure of immoral thoughts and deeds, but between the instinctual desires of the id, a moralising agent known as the ego, and a poor psychic entity, the super-ego, which endeavoured, like the horses of Plato&amp;rsquo;s chariot (Freud&amp;rsquo;s metaphor), to mediate between the other two contenders for control.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This was welcome news. No longer was I the unhappy host of an all-too-easily stained soul, but a more complex creature. It was a model of internal psychic life that not only relegated dirty thoughts and actions to the id, but, more importantly, allocated all one&amp;rsquo;s oppressive moralising concerns about such naughty matters to the self-righteousness of the super-ego.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We do bad things. We think bad thoughts. We thoroughly despise ourselves for both our bad thoughts and our bad actions. And there really is no psychic detergent that will clear up all these contradictions. They are constantly present.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My childhood priests, immersed in their doctrinal certainties, had no time for such complexities. Their detergent model of psychic life was without ambiguity, free from all internal contradiction. How could they have been so simple-minded? Freud asked himself the exact same question. &amp;ldquo;Why is it,&amp;rdquo; he wrote, &amp;ldquo;that none of all the pious ever discovered psychoanalysis? Why did it have to wait for a completely godless Jew?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Our Own Worst Enemy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5946/book-review-our-own-worst-enemy#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Trump Supporter at Minneapolis Rally (Tony Webster / Flickr)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-03-at-14.44.19.jpg" height="898" alt="Trump voter" width="1330" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Blame for the populist irruptions which have beset many democracies in recent years has been widely distributed: bewildered observers have blamed bankers, politicians, academics, journalists, social media platforms &amp;ndash; apologies to anyone omitted. Most, however, have been reluctant to blame one fairly obvious cohort of culprits: voters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Nichols, a professor at the US Naval War College and contributor to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;USA Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and others, suffers no such squeamishness. Nichols is an old-school American conservative who believes that the responsibilities of a citizen are at least as important as their rights. His previous book, 2017&amp;rsquo;s tremendous &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Death of Expertise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was an indictment of the widespread abandonment of established knowledge in favour of quackery. His hugely entertaining (and vastly popular) Twitter feed often concerns itself with more prosaic manifestations of poor citizenship, notably slovenly deportment among aeroplane passengers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Our Own Worst Enemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; makes a persuasive case that all such symptoms have essentially the same cause: the wilful retreat, by a great many adult inhabitants of wealthy, safe and free countries, into a state of toddler-like fury at anything that contradicts, thwarts or upsets them. Trump&amp;rsquo;s victory in 2016 was the most obvious manifestation of this. A transcendentally ignorant, risibly unqualified blowhard and buffoon &amp;ndash; and arguably America&amp;rsquo;s worst unimprisoned citizen &amp;ndash; Trump presided over an administration of astonishing corruption and ineptitude. Last November, 74 million Americans declared that they wanted four more years of it. (Nichols, who was among those American conservatives who commendably denounced Trump, now believes that the entire Republican Party for which he once worked and voted requires urgent ushering into history&amp;rsquo;s dustbin.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The men who wrote the US constitution had a keen understanding of power&amp;rsquo;s corrosive effects, and therefore devised a means of distributing it so that nobody could have too much. But they also appreciated that institutions, however solid, will not maintain themselves. James Madison, who helped draft the constitution and later served as president, warned that &amp;ldquo;No theoretical checks &amp;ndash; no form of government can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.&amp;rdquo; John Adams, the second president, cautioned that &amp;ldquo;public virtue cannot exist in a nation without private virtue&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Nichols, it should be stressed, is not altogether a curmudgeonly Jeremiah, clad in a sandwich board, pronouncing imminent doom at irritated commuters. It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that he would agree entirely with H. L. Mencken&amp;rsquo;s assessment of Americans as &amp;ldquo;the most timorous, snivelling, poltroonish, ignominious mob of serfs and goose-steppers ever gathered under one flag in Christendom since the end of the Middle Ages&amp;rdquo;. Nor is he one of those tiresome posturing Spartans advocating the scouring moral benefits of warfare or other hardship. But &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Our Own Worst Enemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; does argue that the United States&amp;rsquo; prosperity &amp;ndash; unrivalled in human history &amp;ndash; has made a hefty and noisy sector of Americans if not soft, then soft in the head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The opening chapter, &amp;ldquo;A Hunger For Apocalypse&amp;rdquo;, is an especially astute diagnosis of what currently ails America &amp;ndash; and given the contagion of American manias, much of the west. People burdened with troubles and obstacles relatively tiny when compared to most of today&amp;rsquo;s world, and certainly almost all of history, are determined to perceive themselves as brutally oppressed and perched on the edge of disaster. Variations on such fantasies substantially drove the votes for Trump, Brexit and other populist causes, and were certainly a catalyst for the rabble without a clue who ransacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;There is a temptation to assume that Trump&amp;rsquo;s failure to win re-election in 2020 signified a breaking of this lunatic fever. It did not. Whether or not Trump seeks, or wins, re-election in 2024 &amp;ndash; and neither eventuality is unlikely &amp;ndash; the self-indulgent rage he both emboldened and exemplified is still at large, and is all the more hazardous for its unmooring from reality. &amp;ldquo;The diminishing of threats and the elevation of expectations,&amp;rdquo; writes Nichols, &amp;ldquo;coupled with the dullness of daily life in a society gorged on more forms of leisure than it can comprehend, is both the triumph of liberal democracy and a danger to it.&amp;rdquo; The great service performed by &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Our Own Worst Enemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is to remind us just how clear, and how present, that danger remains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Supernova__CGI_.jpg" height="547" alt="supernovae" width="720" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;To huge excitement, and with great anxiety, NASA&amp;rsquo;s James Webb Space Telescope launched into space on Christmas Day. At a cost of nearly $10 billion, it is the most expensive ever built. Yet for astronomers, its price is fully justified. The telescope will effectively be able to look back in time to the origins of the universe, shedding greater light on the earliest so-called &amp;ldquo;super-luminous supernovae&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; searingly bright stellar explosions that have only begun to be recorded in the past two decades.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It was in 1931 that Fritz Zwicky and Walter Baade of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who were researching &amp;ldquo;novae&amp;rdquo;, made the first claim about exploding stars that were bigger and more powerful than previously believed possible. Their study built on a discovery made eight years earlier by Edwin Hubble, who used the 2.5-metre Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson near Los Angeles to confirm that the mysterious &amp;ldquo;spiral nebulae&amp;rdquo; that scientists had been puzzling over since the 1850s were &amp;ldquo;galaxies&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; great islands of stars separate from our Milky Way and millions of light years away. Zwicky and Baade noticed that such galaxies sometimes hosted stellar explosions. Knowing these explosions were enormously far away yet still visible, the two astronomers concluded they belonged to a new class of &amp;ldquo;supernovae&amp;rdquo;, around 10 million times more luminous than standard novae.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;That turned out not to be the end of it. In 2005, scientists discovered the first &amp;ldquo;super-luminous supernova&amp;rdquo;, 100 times as powerful as the supernovae discovered by Zwicky and Baade. This was recognised as a distinct class of stellar explosion six years later. Astronomers were shocked. How could they possibly have missed the brightest ones?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;One reason super-luminous supernovae went unnoticed until the 21st century is that they account for only about one in every 10,000 supernovae. Another is that scientists searching for supernovae tended to concentrate on big galaxies, with astronomers reasoning that the more stars in a galaxy, the greater the chance there is of one going supernova. Nature, however, had other ideas: it put super-luminous supernovae in small, or &amp;ldquo;dwarf&amp;rdquo;, galaxies. Only with the advent of robotic telescopes with wide fields of view were dwarf galaxies caught in astronomers&amp;rsquo; nets. Suddenly, super-luminous supernovae started popping up. Around 100 have so far been discovered.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Not surprisingly, such cosmic mega-explosions occur only in very massive stars. The clue to what powers them may come from what happens in the lead-up to the explosion. The core of such a star actually implodes, shrinking catastrophically to form a super-compact object the size of Mount Everest but with a mass comparable to the Sun. Such a &amp;ldquo;neutron star&amp;rdquo; spins fast for the same reason an ice skater who pulls in her arms does: she conserves angular momentum. These stars can spin 1,000 times a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such an extraordinary flywheel has more than enough rotational energy to energise a super-luminous supernova, providing there is some way to transfer that energy to material exploding outwards. One such way is via an enormously strong magnetic field. And there is reason to believe such neutron stars can have a magnetic field between 100 billion and 100 trillion times as strong as a fridge magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it has taken almost two decades to find the first 100 super-luminous supernovae, the discovery rate will soon be boosted by the James Webb Space Telescope. With its 6.5-metre mirror, it will be able to detect super-luminous supernovae at greater distances and at earlier cosmic times. At the dawn of the universe, there were many more dwarf galaxies than today because they had not yet merged to form today&amp;rsquo;s giant galaxies. And there are theoretical reasons to believe that the first generation of stars to form after the Big Bang were monsters, possibly more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. Super-luminous supernovae could easily have been more common at the beginning of time.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This raises an interesting possibility: you are made of stardust. The iron in your blood, the calcium in your bones &amp;ndash; these elements were forged inside stars that lived and detonated before the Earth was born. They mingled with clouds of interstellar gas that later congealed to form the Sun and the Earth. Super-luminous supernovae could therefore have contributed a significant fraction of the elements in your body. In which case, there is no need to use a $10 billion telescope to see a piece of a super-luminous supernova. Just hold up your hand!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Faith in education</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5944/faith-in-education#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="A crucifix hangs on the wall of a Catholic school in Warwickshire in the UK (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-03-at-14.12.22.jpg" height="888" alt="Crucifix in a classroom" width="1330" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;To anyone trying to navigate it for the first time, England&amp;rsquo;s education system can seem like an old ship, endlessly patched and repatched by successive governments until the original structure has been lost and nothing moves without taking on water. Its Byzantine edifice of rules and regulations contains many a rotting timber &amp;ndash; not least the exceptional status given to faith schools. These are defined as schools of religious &amp;ldquo;character&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ethos&amp;rdquo;, or which may have formal links to a religious organisation. The National Secular Society (NSS), which campaigns against faith schools, estimates that about one in three schools in England and Wales, both independent and state-funded, can be so labelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These schools are permitted to select some or all of their students, as well as their staff, on the basis of their or their family&amp;rsquo;s religion. Then there is the curriculum. It may be no surprise that faith schools are allowed to teach religious education &amp;ldquo;within the tenets of their faith&amp;rdquo;. Yet this also applies to relationships and sex education, giving them leeway to insert bias and promote religious doctrine on important topics such as homosexuality, extra-marital sex and women&amp;rsquo;s rights.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Opponents are concerned about the extension of influence from churches, mosques and synagogues into schools &amp;ndash; particularly as, in addition to Ofsted inspections, faith schools are subject to statutory &amp;ldquo;religiosity inspections&amp;rdquo; by their sponsoring religious body. The problem becomes more worrying when it comes to unregistered faith schools, which are not regulated at all and which operate in a shadowy world on the margins of the law. Although they are far fewer in number, these schools can have a severe effect on the lives and future prospects of the children who pass through their doors.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;However, even when properly run, many faith schools fail adequately to serve the needs of their local communities &amp;ndash; a problem that grows more complex as England&amp;rsquo;s population becomes more diverse. Even if parents are happy for their children to be brought up within the narrow tenets of a particular faith and with limited exposure to different ways of thinking, it is far from clear that this is always done with children&amp;rsquo;s best interests in mind. We might question, then, why state faith schools &amp;ndash; funded in part or wholly by the taxpayer &amp;ndash; are still able to be established with apparent ease, regardless of the wishes of locals and prospective parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case of one such school, which opened in September just south of Peterborough, illustrates the complexity and depth of the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p1"&gt;A "Catholic ethos" in the school curriculum&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;St John Henry Newman Catholic primary school was developed to serve a growing housing development in the town of Hampton Water. Its &amp;ldquo;Catholic ethos&amp;rdquo;, according to its sponsor, the Catholic Diocese of East Anglia, &amp;ldquo;will permeate all areas of the curriculum and underpin the school&amp;rsquo;s work and objectives&amp;rdquo;. It is a voluntary aided (VA) school, benefitting from the funds set aside by the government in 2019 for 14 new VA faith schools, to add to the 2,640-odd already established in England.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Local opinion seems not to have been factored in. A consultation was conducted by Peterborough city council, but among those who gave a Hampton postcode, 127 opposed the school. Only 17 were in favour. &amp;ldquo;Hampton Water is a very diverse community,&amp;rdquo; said Tracy Butler, a resident who campaigned against the school. &amp;ldquo;We have lots of different faiths; we also have residents of no faith at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The reasons behind the approval have never been made clear. &amp;ldquo;The Department of Education have on multiple occasions . . . refused to provide any information about how they assess these proposals,&amp;rdquo; says Alastair Lichten, co-ordinator of No More Faith Schools. As such, it is difficult to tell how far St John Henry Newman, or JHN, is symptomatic of a wider trend. Even so, a pressing question remains: why has the UK government supported a new wave of faith schools, permitting them to open in parts of the country whose inhabitants they may not represent?&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anger in Hampton Water is likely to have been compounded by the way the school was funded. Ten per cent of the capital costs were raised through a charge on local facilities, levied by the council on developers and passed on to purchasers. This means that, in buying a property in the housing development, residents will have helped to pay for the school, despite not knowing what type it would be.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This could happen anywhere, so that young families moving to a new housing development in England might end up paying for a faith school their children are not qualified to attend. At JHN, as at other VA schools, the remaining 90 per cent of capital costs, and 100 per cent of running costs, are being funded by the state. In other words, we&amp;rsquo;re all paying for religious privilege.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true that the Diocese has committed an additional &amp;pound;250,000 to projects at JHN. However, foremost among these are a chapel and &amp;ldquo;a crucifix on the outside wall of the school&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; hardly symbols of inclusivity. According to Lichten, JHN will be &amp;ldquo;the most discriminatory new school that has opened in England in about 10 years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government has typically justified faith schools on the grounds that they improve academic results and increase parents&amp;rsquo; choice. In a 2014 Commons debate on Catholic schools, the Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, praised their &amp;ldquo;high performance&amp;rdquo;, which he attributed to their &amp;ldquo;ethos and character&amp;rdquo; (Hinds himself attended a Catholic grammar school). The evidence, however, is less clear. A 2016 report by the Education Policy Institute found that while pupils in state faith schools did do better academically than their peers at non-faith schools, the gap was much smaller when controlling for factors such as socioeconomic background and prior attainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Religious groups have certainly latched on to the diversity argument. In the case of JHN, the Diocese said that a new Catholic school would &amp;ldquo;enhance choice and diversity of education provision for parents within the Hampton area&amp;rdquo;. What will actually happen, says Butler, is that the school will end up selecting children from Catholic families living further away in preference to local children from non-Catholic families. As a resident, she sees JHN as &amp;ldquo;a huge missed opportunity for integration&amp;rdquo;. People moved into the area &amp;ldquo;hoping that their children would all be able to go to school together&amp;rdquo;, she says.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yet the government seems unperturbed, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t even bother to monitor the effectiveness of faith-selective admissions. In response to a Freedom of Information request by the NSS in 2020, the Department for Education (DfE) admitted that it &amp;ldquo;does not hold information on which schools select on the basis of religion as an element of their admissions criteria&amp;rdquo;. They do not seem to be concerned that religious organisations may be using the school system in England to extend their power, largely at the expense of those who do not share their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;The grip of the Church of England&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;It is no coincidence that the organisation to take the greatest advantage of this means of influence is the Church of England, the established church of this country. The C of E is the biggest sponsor of faith schools, and is currently running 4,644 state schools, around three-quarters of which are primary schools. It estimates that around 15 million adults alive today will have attended one of its schools in the course of their education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask most people about their experience of attending an Anglican school, a common view is that it &amp;ldquo;didn&amp;rsquo;t do me any harm&amp;rdquo;, or that all it really teaches is &amp;ldquo;being nice to people&amp;rdquo;. There is little doubt that the C of E is, for historical reasons, the best assimilated into mainstream British culture. But by the same token, most of its so-called &amp;ldquo;Christian values&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; faith and piety aside &amp;ndash; are no longer seen as distinctively Christian, but rather as near-universal. Anglicanism in particular does not form part of the identity of most British people, especially in younger age groups: only 1 per cent of 18-to-24 year-olds identify themselves with the creed, according to the NSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed to be playing on the mind of Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, when he urged the General Synod, in a paper presented in June, to adopt &amp;ldquo;a bolder commitment to Christian education and ministry with children, young people and students,&amp;rdquo; emphasising the need for &amp;ldquo;youth evangelism&amp;rdquo;. Clearly it is a question of survival.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The so-called &amp;ldquo;religiosity inspections&amp;rdquo; are a key tool in this drive to proselytise. State-funded faith schools must be inspected by their sponsoring religious body every five years. According to Matthew Hill, a former head teacher who contributed to a recent NSS report on the subject, schools have to show not only that their values are &amp;ldquo;rooted in an exclusively Christian narrative&amp;rdquo;, but that they are working closely with the local church. He has also seen inspectors questioning primary school children, some as young as five, on theology. &amp;ldquo;Some were asked about the Trinitarian nature of God,&amp;rdquo; he said. A 2020 NSS report examined 40 &amp;ldquo;religiosity&amp;rdquo; reports on schools produced by two C of E dioceses in 2019. It found that over half &amp;ldquo;conflated successful [religious education] with promoting or eliciting Christian viewpoints&amp;rdquo;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yet in Hill&amp;rsquo;s experience, few parents realise the difference between a religiosity inspection and a standard Ofsted inspection. The inspections thus put enormous pressure on heads to &amp;ldquo;ramp up the evangelism. . . If the school used to be an excellent church school and now it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;requires improvement&amp;rsquo; church school, that&amp;rsquo;s not good PR.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The C of E&amp;rsquo;s involvement in education isn&amp;rsquo;t only confined to the promotion of the Christian faith. In order to protect its own privileges, the organisation seems to feel compelled to defend all religions against the encroachments of secular democracy. This approach has even extended to unregistered faith schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Disadvantaging minorities&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;By law, all schools for children aged 5 to 16, both state-funded and independent, must register with the DfE and submit to regular inspections. However, &lt;br /&gt;according to statutory guidance, &amp;ldquo;out-of-school settings&amp;rdquo; that provide cultural, religious and other types of &amp;ldquo;study support&amp;rdquo; only need register as schools if they are operating for at least 18 hours a week, and teach five or more children. Some organisations, including Charedi (ultra-Orthodox Jewish) and fundamentalist Islamic and Christian groups, use this provision to their advantage. While claiming to operate for less than the 18-hour limit, or outside normal hours, they in fact run as full-time religious schools. According to an updated report on unregistered schools published by Ofsted in November 2021, children attending them are &amp;ldquo;at risk because there is no formal external oversight of safeguarding, health and safety or the quality of education provided&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very secretiveness of these unofficial schools makes it hard to estimate how many there are, let alone the numbers of students. However, recent data from Ofsted showed that 90 out-of-school settings in Britain with a Christian, Jewish or Muslim faith have been investigated for potential illegality over the course of the last five years. There is additional concern that children whose parents claim they are in elective home education (EHE) are actually at unregistered schools, and that this figure has increased since the Covid-19 lockdowns made EHE more common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in 2015, when radicalisation was high on the political agenda, the existence of these schools &amp;ndash; in particular their potential rejection of &amp;ldquo;British values&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; was of sufficient concern for the government to launch a consultation on ways to regulate out-of-school settings where these provided &amp;ldquo;intensive education&amp;rdquo;. However, as reported in the&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Catholic Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2017, Justin Welby, as Archbishop of Canterbury, personally lobbied &amp;ldquo;senior members of the government&amp;rdquo; not to change the law, while Caroline Spelman MP approached the Cabinet on behalf of the Church Commissioners.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The fear of both Anglican and Catholic interests was that a law change would subject Sunday schools and Bible study groups to unwelcome meddling. The lobbying was effective. As the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Catholic Herald&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; put it: &amp;ldquo;Very quickly, and very quietly, the government dropped the idea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, however, the existence of unregistered schools has continued to receive media attention, thanks in part to campaigns by the NSS and Humanists UK. Ofsted inspectors have also made some progress in closing the schools. However, despite promising signs, the government has yet to tighten the law sufficiently to stop them altogether &amp;ndash; and, according to Ofsted figures, there have only been five successful prosecutions. The DfE issued guidance in 2020 on the proper conduct of out-of-school settings, including &lt;span class="s1"&gt;yeshivas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="s1"&gt;madrasas&lt;/span&gt;, but it is non-statutory and voluntary &amp;ndash; in other words, it is all but useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, an unknown number of children may still be receiving education solely at unregistered religious schools, and potentially suffering a range of harms, from ideological indoctrination to ignorance of basic life skills, to safety risks and even physical abuse.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In October last year, for instance, a father and daughter, Arshad and Nadia Ali, were convicted for a second time of running an unregistered Islamic school in south London. Ofsted identified a number of safeguarding failures at Ambassadors High School, as it was known, including a failure to properly vet the adults working with the children, and insufficient fire safety provisions. Inspectors had previously found that &amp;ldquo;the headteacher had no plan or strategy to promote fundamental British values, or encourage respect for other people&amp;rdquo;. It is difficult to imagine how students who attend such institutions will be able to relate to people of different backgrounds with whom they may have to work and live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another example is the unregistered schools known to operate in Charedi communities, particularly in the London boroughs of Hackney and Haringey. These communities tend to keep themselves largely isolated from wider society in order to preserve their fundamentalist religious practices. However, their inner workings have been brought to light by the Jewish organisation Nahamu, whose website describes its members as &amp;ldquo;deeply involved in the religious Jewish community&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;concerned about increasing levels of extremist discourse and obscurantism&amp;rdquo; within it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Eve Sacks, board member at Nahamu, explains, Charedi schools are &amp;ldquo;almost exclusively for boys over 13&amp;rdquo;. They provide no secular education. &amp;ldquo;Mainly they learn the Talmud and they might also learn the Torah,&amp;rdquo; she says. The boys speak in Yiddish, a vernacular language, and learn to read Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic. The focus is not on writing essays: &amp;ldquo;literally what are they doing is just reading text&amp;rdquo; and receiving lectures from rabbis on how to interpret it, Sacks says. They may be doing this for as much as 12 hours a day, five and a half days a week.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ironically, the girls &amp;ndash; who are forbidden to learn the Torah &amp;ndash; receive a better education, albeit a limited and segregated one, in independent but registered faith schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One consequence of this system is that the boys grow up barely able to speak English. Sacks has been approached by Charedi men in their twenties who want to go to university but cannot fill in an application form. &amp;ldquo;And I think, my goodness, you were really wronged there.&amp;rdquo; The lack of education in secular subjects in any language means that their choice of profession is very limited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Abuse of children in faith schools&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Another problem is safeguarding. In 2019, Amanda Spielman, Ofsted Chief Inspector, was tipped off about a pamphlet entitled &amp;ldquo;Encouragement to teachers and guidance for parents&amp;rdquo;. The pamphlet was written in Hebrew and published with the approval of &amp;ldquo;senior rabbinical figures&amp;rdquo; within the Charedi community, some of whom were thought to be serving teachers at unregistered schools. In her evidence to a statutory government enquiry on child protection, Spielman related that much of the pamphlet came across as &amp;ldquo;a manifesto for corporal punishment&amp;rdquo;. Its author states that &amp;ldquo;force&amp;rdquo; should be used on students &amp;ldquo;to knock down the strength of the evil inclination &amp;ndash; to put fear on them &amp;ndash; to make them submissive because submission is the foundation to revoke their own opinion and receive the faith&amp;rdquo;. In one unregistered faith school, inspectors found that isolation and forced standing for long periods were used as sanctions even on &amp;ldquo;young children&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when they are told about the issues at unregistered schools, however, public authorities have often been reluctant to intervene, not least because of worries that they will be accused of racism. But this attitude, argues Sacks, is misguided. It is little better than saying that &amp;ldquo;everybody&amp;rsquo;s entitled to get GCSEs unless you&amp;rsquo;re a Charedi Jew&amp;rdquo;. What is truly &amp;ldquo;antisemitic&amp;rdquo; is depriving these children of the opportunity to have a basic secular education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these problems, it is Sacks&amp;rsquo; impression that &amp;ldquo;a reasonably large percentage of the community&amp;rdquo; are happy with their unofficial system, which aims to turn boys into &amp;ldquo;scholars&amp;rdquo; and girls into &amp;ldquo;good wives and mothers&amp;rdquo;. If, however, parents wish to send their children into a mainstream school, they risk being shunned. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re excluded from your synagogue and none of your relations talk to you and everybody gossips about you when you&amp;rsquo;re in the street.&amp;rdquo; For the few who choose to leave the community altogether, moving into mainstream British society is very difficult. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like being an immigrant even though it&amp;rsquo;s the country you&amp;rsquo;ve been brought up in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no easy answers to the numerous problems posed by faith schools, even those that are registered. A partial solution advocated by the NSS and others would be to remove their right to select students on the basis of their religion. This would at least ensure they are serving their local area. At the same time, continuing to allow for religiously selective independent schools, but all the while giving Ofsted real powers to regulate them and requiring them to follow a basic secular curriculum, would at least provide some protection for students&amp;rsquo; autonomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be that, as the C of E and other advocates of faith schools argue, going to such a school, in addition to satisfying religious parents, does not inevitably harm a child or prevent him or her from making friends with children from families of other cultural and philosophical persuasions. There may even be meaningful reasons why some faith schools, at least well-established ones, can provide a higher quality of education than non-faith schools. However, these arguments have to be weighed against the benefits of integrating children into wider British society and exposing them to new ideas in the most impressionable part of their lives. There also remains the question of whether it is appropriate for religious organisations to be wielding so much power behind the scenes through their influence over the school system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it is difficult to see how the knotty problem of faith schools will ever be disentangled as long as politicians and public authorities continue to defer to religion and shrink from scrutinising minority groups. In the balancing act between the rights of parents and children, which every state has to make, deference to religious interests almost inevitably favours parents, whose minds are made up, over children, who have yet to discover things.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;Children are children,&amp;rdquo; says Terri Haynes, a Peterborough councillor and teacher. &amp;ldquo;They might have Catholic parents, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them Catholic.&amp;rdquo; Yet this is how they are treated by faith schools, with or without their parents&amp;rsquo; consent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A breakthrough might come with a written national constitution founded on secular principles of universal application. This is something that Britain, unlike France or the US, has never had. Yet unfortunately, this prospect seems increasingly distant in a land of such creaking antiquity. In the long term, though, it is hard to see how separating the education system more clearly from religious interests could fail to benefit those whom it ought, above all, to serve: the students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoD is back in business!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
