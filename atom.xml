<p class="lead">I said I was going to optimize my classroom management for flexibility, but this is ridiculous. I’m supposed to be teaching a lab right now, but the science building caught fire.</p>
<p>It was more of a tiny smolder, but we did get a lot of smoke in the building. I heard that plumbers were soldering some pipes in the ceiling, and something caught fire, and now the fire department kicked everyone out of the building and are trying to make sure there is nothing else burning in that space before they let us back in. “A few more hours,” the fire person said. So I had to cancel lab.</p>
<p>Now the next few days are wrecked for me, because I’m trying to accommodate a lot of busy students and persuade them to come in at some other time so we can get this cross started. I’m going to have to provide supervised lab access all day tomorrow and Thursday.</p>
<p>I swear, this job is trying to break me, but honestly, I’m already broken.</p>

They’ve consolidated their power.</p>
<blockquote><p>The wealth of the world’s 10 richest men has doubled since the pandemic began. The incomes of 99% of humanity are worse off because of COVID-19. Widening economic, gender, and racial inequalities—as well as the inequality that exists between countries—are tearing our world apart. This is not by chance, but choice: “economic violence” is perpetrated when structural policy choices are made for the richest and most powerful people. This causes direct harm to us all, and to the poorest people, women and girls, and racialized groups most. Inequality contributes to the death of at least one person every four seconds. But we can radically redesign our economies to be centered on equality. We can claw back extreme wealth through progressive taxation; invest in powerful, proven inequality-busting public measures; and boldly shift power in the economy and society. If we are courageous, and listen to the movements demanding change, we can create an economy in which nobody lives in poverty, nor with unimaginable billionaire wealth—in which inequality no longer kills.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s only a small ‘elite’.</p>
<blockquote><p>The world’s small elite of 2,755 billionaires has seen its fortunes grow more during COVID-19 than they have in the whole of the last fourteen years—fourteen years that themselves were a bonanza for billionaire wealth.<br/>
This is the biggest annual increase in billionaire wealth since records began. It is taking place on every continent. It is enabled by skyrocketing stock market prices, a boom in unregulated entities, a surge in monopoly power, and privatization, alongside the erosion of individual corporate tax rates and regulations, and workers’ rights and wages—all aided by the weaponization of racism.<br/>
These trends are alarming. By not vaccinating the world, governments have allowed the conditions for the COVID-19 virus to dangerously mutate. At the same time, they have also created the conditions for an entirely new variant of billionaire wealth. This variant, the billionaire variant, is profoundly dangerous for our world.<br/>
New figures and analysis released in December 2021 by the World Inequality Lab reveal that since 1995, the top 1% have captured 19 times more of global wealth growth than the whole of the bottom 50% of humanity. Inequality is now as great as it was at the pinnacle of Western imperialism in the early 20th century. The Gilded Age of the late 19th Century has been surpassed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The good news: we’ll only need a small number of guillotines to take care of that group.</p>
<p>The bad news: they control the media, and have succeeded in brainwashing hundreds of millions to act against their own interests and prop up the oligarchs. It’s shocking how thoroughly they’ve convinced the mob to spurn vaccination, the most effective tool to control the pandemic. It’s as if the media moguls and politicians are finding it advantageous to promote death and disease.</p>

    <title>Book review: The Best Catholics in the World</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5915/book-review-the-best-catholics-in-the-world#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/irel.jpg" height="810" alt="Cover for The Best Catholics in the World" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Catholics in the World:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Irish, The Church and the End of a Special Relationship &lt;/strong&gt;(Penguin)&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; by &lt;/span&gt;Derek Scally&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Pope John Paul II visited Ireland in 1979, he drew an audience of over a million &amp;ndash; around a third of the country&amp;rsquo;s population &amp;ndash; to mass in Dublin. Barely three decades later, the moral and political authority of the Catholic Church in Ireland had collapsed, destroyed most of all by devastating revelations of clerical sex abuse and cover-up. How and why Ireland lost faith in the Catholic Church, and how it feels about Catholicism now, is the subject of this book. Derek Scally is a Berlin-based Irish journalist who returned to his homeland to explore how his and his country&amp;rsquo;s Catholic past &amp;ldquo;went from rigid reality to vanishing act&amp;rdquo; and to &amp;ldquo;reflect on the trauma that remains&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Post-independence Ireland was not quite a de jure theocracy, but for many decades it was certainly a de facto one. The 1937 Constitution of Ireland explicitly recognised the &amp;ldquo;special position&amp;rdquo; of the Roman Catholic Church &amp;ldquo;as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of its citizens&amp;rdquo;. This provision was removed in 1972, but the might of the Catholic Church in Ireland lay less in formal constitutional power and more in the societal influence it wielded, particularly over education and health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This influence was seen in episodes like the &amp;ldquo;mother and child&amp;rdquo; scheme controversy in 1948, when the socialist health minister No&amp;euml;l Browne had to resign after his healthcare programme was deemed contrary to Catholic teaching. From 1937 to 1995 divorce and remarriage were not permitted in Ireland. For many decades contraception and abortion were also prohibited (even now, following the 2018 referendum, access to abortion remains fairly restricted). Censorship was also extensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasons why the Catholic Church came to have the whip hand over Irish society are complex. In the 19th century parts of the Irish independence movement had non-sectarian &amp;ndash; or even, to use later parlance, secularist &amp;ndash; leanings. The 1790s Irish independence leader Wolfe Tone famously sought to &amp;ldquo;unite Catholics and dissenters&amp;rdquo; and the authors of the 1867 Proclamation of the Irish Republic declared in favour of &amp;ldquo;absolute liberty of conscience, and the complete separation of church and state&amp;rdquo;. But after partition and independence in 1922 the Catholic Church manoeuvred itself into a societally dominant role. The version of Catholicism which prevailed thereafter was a particularly harsh, abusive and anti-intellectual one: &amp;ldquo;a mental prison to be endured,&amp;rdquo; as Scally describes it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An issue which permeates much of his book is the extent of societal knowledge of, and complicity in, the abuses perpetrated by the institutional church. When it came to clerical sex abuse, so many people &amp;ldquo;knew but didn&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;. As Scally says, &amp;ldquo;Survivors of neglect and abuse are the victims. Those with power carry the guilt. And what of those of us in between? Where do we place ourselves on the sliding scale between innocence and complicity? Can we separate guilt from shame, and begin exploring?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This raises many interesting questions, including about the conformity and deference so prevalent in 20th-century Ireland, which Scally examines with skill and subtlety. I would like him to have said more about those who did resist and challenge Church power in Ireland, and what differentiated them from those who didn&amp;rsquo;t. But perhaps that would be a different book. This is not a formal history, but rather an attempt at understanding how a society feels about its recent past, and how it comes to terms with it. On that aspect, Scally draws some interesting contrasts between Ireland and another society he knows well and which also carries the burden of history: Germany.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many Germans consider that while no one alive today carries blame for the Nazi era, citizens have a moral responsibility to understand and embrace their history.By contrast, in Ireland, Scally sees a reluctance to analyse the past and to grapple with what the Church&amp;rsquo;s overweening power did to Ireland. &amp;ldquo;We have museums for whiskey, the GAA [Gaelic Athletic Association], the Famine, Jewish history, tenement life, James Joyce, leprechauns &amp;ndash; but not for the most influential institution in Irish history.&amp;rdquo; Meanwhile, the promised memorials to the victims of the Magdalene Laundries and other institutional abuses have yet to appear. Too many people would rather not talk about it. Scally ends this beautifully written and nuanced book with a powerful &amp;ndash; and, I think, unanswerable &amp;ndash; plea for Irish society to embrace much more openly and honestly the &amp;ldquo;complex events in our contested Catholic past&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter edition 2021. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A study in failure</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5914/a-study-in-failure#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Austrian writer Thomas Bernhard (Everett Collection Inc / Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/hd01jh.jpg" height="595" alt="Thomas Bernhard" width="864" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Books are frequently given and received as prescriptions: this one enlightens, that one cheers you up. Readers expect books to assist them in some way: to educate them, perhaps, or to deepen the moral sense. The books of the Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard might be recommended as prescriptions too. Only they function as purgatives.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Bernhard, who died in 1989, is famous for the bleakness of his outlook. From his first novel, &lt;em&gt;Frost&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1963, to &lt;em&gt;Extinction&lt;/em&gt; (1986), the novelist and playwright developed a distinctive style and mode of cultural critique. His works draw attention to, and then revel in, the unremitting cruelty of human relations and the pretentious futility of cultural life. It is through this effect that they achieve their purgative function, inviting us to cast out all our attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s novels are now available in English translation and readers have been purging themselves with them for some time. They have been joined at last by &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt;, one of his shortest. For years it was hard to come by, having long been out of print in its previous translation. Now issued in a new translation by Douglas Robertson, it has been published by Spurl Editions, a California-based press who describe themselves as specialists &amp;ldquo;in works fitting for our current decrepit and apocalyptic world&amp;rdquo;. &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt; has clearly found a good home.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Much of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s ire was directed against his own native Austria and was designed to make uncomfortable reading in that context. In his books, Vienna is a hateful place to live, representing the death of culture, along with the annihilation of art and intellect. Bernhard attacked Austria relentlessly as a country that he believed remained, following the end of the war, dominated by the twin spectres of Catholicism and National Socialism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is tempting to read Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s work biographically: this is the outlook of a man who was born illegitimately and whose father rejected him, who was schooled first by Catholic priests and then by Nazis (in his autobiography, he described school as &amp;ldquo;a machine for the mutilation of my mind&amp;rdquo;). Suffering from a chronic lung condition, he lived as a young adult among invalids, enduring botched medical interventions and the care of Catholic nuns. It is easy to see him as a tortured man, trapped in an ailing body, living with a death sentence and looking resentfully at the world around him. But this would do him an injustice. The themes in his work may be dark, but there is the sense that Bernhard is always there, in the background, laughing heartily at what he attacks. And besides, many of the themes covered in his work can be extended elsewhere. What makes Bernhard so persistently disturbing is that the world he depicts in his novels is often still recognisable, more than three decades after his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recurrent theme is that of intellectual obsession. Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s obsessed intellectuals are great procrastinators. They have an epoch-making study in mind but never get down to writing it. Their commitment makes them ruthless to themselves and others, and because that work is never accomplished, there can be no possible justification for the pain it has produced.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A project of this type appears in &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt;, where Koller, the main protagonist, spends the entire novel attempting to write his &lt;em&gt;Physiognomy&lt;/em&gt;, a great work in which important observations regarding the imprint of world history and nature and personal experience will be revealed through the study of facial features. The cohort for this study are the &amp;ldquo;cheap-eaters&amp;rdquo;, a group of men who for years have sat at the same table in the Vienna Public Kitchen, ordering the cheapest meal available. The intellectual challenge Koller has set himself is considerable. In order to bring his study to completion, he must hold the &amp;ldquo;entirety of nature and the entirety of the science of nature in his mind&amp;rdquo;. This simply cannot be done, and so Koller sets himself up to fail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Confronted by the inanity of everything ever written'&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another important theme in Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s work is the destruction of research subjects by their investigator, most brutally rendered in &lt;em&gt;The Lime Works&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1970. A claustrophobic masterpiece, the novel follows the scholar Konrad and his disabled wife Zryd as they imprison themselves in an abandoned lime works near the Austrian town of Sicking. Konrad has them live there so that he can have the space, and peace, to begin writing his masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;The Sense of Hearing&lt;/em&gt;. He submits his wife to his obsession with hearing, attempting to teach her to hear tiny variations in a phrase he mutters in her ear, each day, until she collapses with exhaustion. His lesson, which is also his experiment, ultimately fails, and eventually he ends it with a bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt; is interesting for subverting this trend. Koller studies his subjects but does not cause them pain or discomfort. However much he inspects them, they go on eating easily alongside one another. Furthermore, when he first arrives at the Vienna Public Kitchen, Koller finds that they do not subject him to the intrusive inspection that he normally receives as soon as his prosthetic leg is noted. They do not confront him, as Bernhard writes, with &amp;ldquo;that common, squalid, and repulsive sort&amp;rdquo; of look &amp;ldquo;with which people like him are otherwise universally and incessantly confronted and to which they are exposed and subjected in the most vulgar and shameless fashion&amp;rdquo;. This does not mean that the cheap-eaters do not inspect him at all. Actually, they submit him to a &amp;ldquo;thorough and by no means squeamish inspection&amp;rdquo; as he eats. They see him clearly, but they do not judge his &amp;ldquo;crippled condition&amp;rdquo; or ask him to justify his existence, nor do they extend him any sympathy. They merely assist Koller as he attempts to take his seat. This suits Koller&amp;rsquo;s purposes perfectly, since his &lt;em&gt;Physiognomy &lt;/em&gt;relies upon a similar gaze: an inspection of surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One character in &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt;, Goldschmidt &amp;ndash; a bookdealer &amp;ndash; presents an interesting mini-case study of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s wider argument against the intellect. Committed to his work with books, he is also as a result confronted by &amp;ldquo;all the abominableness and brutishness of human history&amp;rdquo; that is contained within them. The bookdealer who takes books seriously &amp;ldquo;is the most pitiable person in the entire human race&amp;rdquo;, Bernhard writes, &amp;ldquo;because day after day and uninterruptedly he is confronted by the absolute inanity of everything ever written and more than any other person he experiences the world as a version of hell&amp;rdquo;. Language is itself irredeemable, from Goldschmidt&amp;rsquo;s perspective. According to what Goldschmidt tells Koller, language consists &amp;ldquo;of words of equal weight&amp;rdquo; by which thoughts are &amp;ldquo;incessantly weighed down and crushed&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Against language, against intellectual culture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are intriguing claims: against language, against books, against intellectual culture. But as with his other novels, logical argument is not the vehicle of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s purging. Rather, through a reiteration and restatement of these claims, his writing offers its own peculiar respite. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Koller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Physiognomy &lt;/em&gt;is never written, of course, and &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt; remains first and foremost an account of intellectual failure. Koller is an interesting example of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s destroyed and destroying intellectual. Separated from others, existing superficially alongside his peers, he pursues his intellectual project with such diligent singlemindedness that he is unable to relate to other human beings. It is tempting to conclude that he cannot complete his Physiognomy because to study others, to speak of the human condition, is to account for the world intellectually. To do that is already to distort the world he perceives and to alienate himself from it.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt; is a magnificently annihilating little book. It presents an opportunity within the space of reading to become distant from the promises of intellectual culture that are made ever more insistently as they are betrayed. With Bernhard, the pleasure is in the purge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Arresting artwork</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5913/arresting-artwork#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Zahid Mayo&amp;rsquo;s portrait of a young girl holding a sheet over her naked body (Courtesey of ArtSoch)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/_Y7A5884v.jpg" height="418" alt="Painting of a girl in Pakistan" width="627" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a late June evening in Lahore, critics, creatives and prospective art buyers rushed to attend the launch of Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s newest contemporary gallery. ArtSoch, in the heart of Gulberg, one of the city&amp;rsquo;s busiest commercial areas, promises to support emerging artists and breathe new life into the country&amp;rsquo;s art scene. It was packed with visitors and a steady stream of reporters. They weren&amp;rsquo;t disappointed. While most of the walls were hung with more traditional work referencing local architecture and beautiful landscapes, one piece stood out, in large part because, for the first half of the launch, it was flipped over, facing the wall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pakistani audiences tend to shy away from controversial topics, and the gallery owners must have been unsure what the public reaction would be. Halfway through the launch, however, the painting was finally revealed. It caused a stir. Zahid Mayo&amp;rsquo;s oil portrait on canvas of a young girl holding a sheet over her naked body would have raised a lot of questions on its own. But the accompanying text in Urdu calligraphy made it the talking point of the launch. It asked: &amp;ldquo;Meray Nange Jism Se Tumhe Kya Masla?&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Why do you have a problem with my naked body?&amp;rdquo;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s conservative and patriarchal norms have long dictated acceptable topics. But the country has also been grappling with a rising feminist movement over the last decade &amp;ndash; one that has, since 2017, been fed by the global #MeToo movement. Women&amp;rsquo;s access to public spaces is still restricted: a recent study found that 70 per cent of males would discourage their female family members from taking public transport, while riding a bike is still taboo. But society&amp;rsquo;s policing of women&amp;rsquo;s bodies is increasingly being questioned. Every year since 2018, the countrywide Aurat (Women&amp;rsquo;s) March has been held, despite critics within both the media and government accusing marchers of going against Pakistani &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; and spreading vulgarity. This intensified after a poster with the slogan &amp;ldquo;Mera Jism Meri Marzi&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;My Body My Choice&amp;rdquo;) went viral in 2015, sparking death threats against the organisers and efforts to ban the march.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this context, placing a semi-nude figure in public is a statement in itself. But as a painting in a gallery, it also drew attention to the pressure placed on women to preserve their bodies away from the eyes of predatory men, rather than the onus being on the men themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Art for social change&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For too long, Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s art scene has lacked both public interest and state support, as well as financial stability. A few established names continue to dominate. Avoiding politics, they stick to aesthetics. Houses are adorned with beautiful paintings with common traditional themes: horses, buildings, landscapes and calligraphy. Co-founder and curator of ArtSoch, Mariam Hanif Khan hopes that the new spaces opening up in Pakistan can draw new and passionate voices to the scene. &amp;ldquo;Our gallery is about mobilising young people because nowadays the younger generation rarely pursue visual arts,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;We want to promote an idea that art is not just visually appealing but has a much deeper meaning.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is likely to be a gradual process, building on work already being done. Karachi&amp;rsquo;s Canvas gallery has been exhibiting thought-provoking contemporary work since 1999. Its founder, Sameera Raja, was an architect before moving into the art world in the hopes of changing what it was that Pakistani society considered to be art. &amp;ldquo;The work we do primarily focuses on building an awareness around art and for that we have to build bridges,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;What good art should do in my opinion is that it should plant a seed in your mind, and that seed doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to flower immediately, because maybe you&amp;rsquo;re ready for it 10 years later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process requires creating spaces that are both safe and engaging. Artists, curators and gallery owners find themselves treading a fine line between creating meaningful, urgent work and being too literal. Finding this balance can lead them to explore social change in unexpected ways. Raja points to Canvas gallery&amp;rsquo;s recent exhibition of Saba Khan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Water Explorer&amp;rdquo;, which showed in August and September. Saba&amp;rsquo;s work centred on the Indus river and the way its water is used. &amp;ldquo;In a way it was pushing boundaries of the conversations we have around water,&amp;rdquo; Raja said, &amp;ldquo;and how the end user is a woman, because it is women who collect water in rural areas and yet they have no say in the larger scheme, in regulatory bodies and committees in Pakistan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Freedom of speech under threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some conversations are easier than others. Noormah Jamal is a Pashtun artist, part of a marginalised ethnic group from the north of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Having grown up in the majority-Pashtun city of Peshawar, Jamal later moved to Lahore to study at the National College of Arts, and was shocked to find how many of her peers were sheltered from knowledge of the ethnic divides that dominate Pakistani society. While Pashtun and other minority activists have been working hard to raise awareness around their mistreatment, the forced disappearance of activists and silencing of their voices by the state, she discovered that their fight is rarely discussed outside their own regions. Jamal decided to do her thesis on gender, race and personal bias, and to confront these issues in her art, which explores identity and emotion through portraiture and sculpture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamal&amp;rsquo;s latest major work is a sculpture series of women in burqas. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve always seen burqas be portrayed as a form of oppression,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Where I grew up in Peshawar, chadars and, later, colourful burqas were a big part of our culture.&amp;rdquo; Many women wore these burqas after the influx of Afghan refugees in the 90s who had fled the first Taliban regime. Her series explores her own childlike fascination with the colourful garments and aims to put out a counter-narrative to that which emphasises the black, Saudi-inspired abaya as an oppressive tool for Muslim women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamal, too, is treading a fine line. She points to the controversy around Adeela Suleman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Killing Fields of Karachi&amp;rdquo;. The installation of tombstone-like sculptures, highlighted by red flowers placed upon the &amp;ldquo;graves&amp;rdquo;, called attention to extra-judicial killings in Karachi at the hands of the police, who the artist believed were also unfairly targeting Pashtuns. It was shown at the 2019 Karachi Biennale for less than half an hour before police removed it. But those 30 minutes made a difference, says Jamal. &amp;ldquo;I feel that even in ransacking [removing the art] it got justice as after that so many people who previously had paid no attention to work like mine, which focused on minorities, were now suddenly asking me about it.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While change will not be immediate, the creation of engaging artwork can help facilitate a dialogue that has long been suppressed. Privately owned galleries give artists a certain freedom away from the hand of the state, yet the growing number of public galleries in Pakistan allow for a different kind of conversation, and for different kinds of art that are not simply made to be sold on the market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crucially, this comes at a time when freedom of speech is under real threat. In September, thousands of journalists protested a bill that, if passed, could shut down media organisations and penalise journalists for &amp;ldquo;defaming&amp;rdquo; military generals, judges and government leaders. Pakistan already ranks near the bottom of global freedom indexes. While artists are censored by the state, and use symbolism to protect themselves, the growth of a larger art world in Pakistan can help push back against this trend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite courting controversy with his portrait of an empowered naked woman, Zahid Mayo&amp;rsquo;s work continues to be exhibited across Pakistan. A definitive change is sweeping through the art world, in the face of dangers and limitations. As Mayo said in a recent interview for the Express Tribune: &amp;ldquo;I think many times the process of art creation in public spaces, and how it has the power to involve people, is much more important than the art itself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>How to build an animal</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="(Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/forbes.jpg" height="589" width="805" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Legend has it that, on the morning of 28 February 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick blew into the Eagle pub in Cambridge proclaiming to the regulars and the world, &amp;ldquo;We have discovered the Secret of Life.&amp;rdquo; They weren&amp;rsquo;t crazy &amp;ndash; the molecular biologists had discovered the structure of DNA, which instantly suggested, as their paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; would put it a few months later, &amp;ldquo;a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DNA molecule, they proposed, was a very long double helix: two strands intertwined like a twisted ladder, with the bases linking up as the rungs holding the strands together. This molecule could reproduce itself by unzipping the two strands and adding the complementary bases to make two new double helixes identical to the original. They had discovered, in outline, how living things manage to reproduce themselves so faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1960s, there was further revelation: we discovered that the bases also constituted another code. This provided the blueprint for the production of the very many proteins that do all the major work in our living cells. Today, every one of the 3 billion bases in human DNA has been fully sequenced. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we&amp;rsquo;ve cracked the Secret of Life. Understanding that it is DNA that transmits the hereditary information and makes proteins was a great breakthrough. But a puzzle remained: for all the insight we have gained into the reproduction of genetic material, it still didn&amp;rsquo;t answer a fundamental question, one that has dogged scientists for centuries: how is an animal built? In other words, once the design is in place, how does the construction happen? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We might think of a symphony, where the DNA constitutes the score. The symphony of life &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;endless forms most beautiful&amp;rdquo; in Darwin&amp;rsquo;s words &amp;ndash; is created from this DNA code or sequence, this &amp;ldquo;score&amp;rdquo;. You can reproduce a Beethoven symphony by photocopying the score, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you how musical instruments and human hands and brains work to turn the notes into living music. What instructs a human, for example, to grow its arms and legs and fingers and toes &amp;ndash; all derived originally from a single cell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extract from the 2005 poem &amp;ldquo;The Spirit Is Too Blunt an Instrument&amp;rdquo; by Anne Stevenson tells us how it&amp;rsquo;s not done:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spirit is too blunt an instrument&lt;br /&gt;to have made this baby.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing so unskilful as human passions&lt;br /&gt;could have managed the intricate&lt;br /&gt;exacting particulars &amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some great principle of biological engineering does create &amp;ldquo;intricate exacting particulars&amp;rdquo;. Clearly, it&amp;rsquo;s not achieved by the human spirit, God or abracadabra. Rather, as we&amp;rsquo;ll see, it is governed by particular protein products of the DNA: a class of chemical agent known as a morphogen, a generator of form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The fundamental &amp;ldquo;bricks&amp;rdquo; of life&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand how morphogens work we need to start with the fundamental &amp;ldquo;bricks&amp;rdquo; of life: the cells. Living things can only develop by means of cells dividing into two and then two again, and so forth. To learn how to build an animal, we therefore need to investigate the properties of these &amp;ldquo;bricks&amp;rdquo;. Biochemically and physiologically, there are many different kinds of cell, but they all look more or less the same. The biochemist Nick Lane puts it like this: &amp;ldquo;I challenge you to look at one of your own cells down a microscope and distinguish it from the cells of a mushroom. They are practically identical.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that we always start from a single living cell, let&amp;rsquo;s pose what seems a manageable question: how do animals acquire four limbs and their attached appendages? We have already shown how DNA can be imagined as a score, a blueprint or a building plan. Without such a plan, dividing cells would simply produce a constantly expanding ball. Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s not what happens. Cells divide more in one direction than another, breaking the symmetry of what would otherwise be a sphere, and creating the shape of the animal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most basic plan for an animal is a trunk with four limbs. All living things have to eat, and, unlike some primitive bacteria that can live off mere raw chemicals, animals have to eat other preformed creatures. Some tiny creatures are just a sausage-tube with a front and back: the front is the end that ingests the food; the end is where waste is expelled. But bigger animals need appendages, which eventually appeared in evolution as fins, arms, legs and wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the next schematic stage for our animal is for limbs to grow off that trunk. All the higher animals &amp;ndash; such as amphibians, reptiles, birds, marsupials and mammals &amp;ndash; have four limbs. Why is that so? Because they evolved from fish, which have just two front and two hind-fins. In birds and bats, two of these limbs became wings. In most of the rest, the four limbs all effectively function as legs. In humans, two of them became arms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this building process work? A few months before Watson and Crick burst into the Eagle, another great thinker made a discovery that would give us our first clue. Alan Turing &amp;ndash; mathematician, Enigma code-breaker and inventor of the concept of the digital computer &amp;ndash; made a contribution to the Secret of Life that is only now receiving its due recognition. Turing showed theoretically how spreading zones of migrating chemicals could create coloured patterns on the coats of animals, whether they be spots or stripes. They had shape-generating properties, and he called them &amp;ldquo;morphogens&amp;rdquo;. Eat your heart out, Kipling and his &lt;em&gt;Just So&lt;/em&gt; story &amp;ldquo;How the Leopard Got His Spots&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scope of morphogens has expanded dramatically since Turing&amp;rsquo;s pioneering work. They are now understood to help create not only two-dimensional patterns but also three-dimensional forms, such as arms and legs and their terminal digits. They do this by diffusing through developing cells, instructing them to change their character as they go, gradually building the appropriate kinds of cells for each part of the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Making our heads, arms and legs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the late 1960s, a related idea was taken up by the inspirational embryologist Lewis Wolpert, who died in January 2021 aged 91. Wolpert was an imaginative thinker, a great team leader and a vigorous populariser of science in books like &lt;em&gt;The Unnatural Nature of Science&lt;/em&gt; (2000). Wolpert suggested the theory that morphogens, as they made their way from their source, diffusing through a growing mass of cells, caused different effects as they travelled further away and their concentration weakened. Near to the source they have one effect; further away a different one. Wolpert called this the &amp;ldquo;French Flag model&amp;rdquo;: one could imagine a &amp;ldquo;French Flag&amp;rdquo; animal that was red at one end, white in the middle and blue at the other end, all produced by the same morphogen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1980s, genes with a related pattern-forming purpose, the hox genes, came into detailed focus, thanks to advances in gene sequencing and manipulation. The protein products of hox genes are &amp;ldquo;super morphogens&amp;rdquo;, specifying the overall body plans of all animals, most significantly the head and the trunk. These super morphogens specify the room plan of the house, if you like, while the morphogens go to work in choosing the kind of cooker, fridge and sink, and decide where they should go in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early 20th century, we had our first inkling of what happens when a super morphogen goes wrong: fruit flies were found with organs growing on the wrong part of the body &amp;ndash; a leg where an antenna should be, or vice versa. Something that told a leg or antenna where to form was malfunctioning. Now we know that something is a hox gene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the super morphogen hox genes specify where the shoulder and pelvic girdle start and then another morphogen comes into play. In 1993, the whimsically named morphogen &amp;ldquo;sonic hedgehog&amp;rdquo; (named on account of its relation to the so-called &amp;ldquo;hedgehog genes&amp;rdquo; that produce bristles on flies) was discovered to control the structure-forming gradients in many parts of the body: how wide apart our eyes are, for example; how the limbs develop from those buds off the main trunk, and how many fingers and toes we have. The latter, for example, shows the French Flag model in action, creating a gradient from thumb (&amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo;), through middle fingers (&amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo;) to pinkie (&amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The function of sonic hedgehog can be seen most clearly in cases where it has been disabled. This happened in Utah in 1957, when sheep were born with a Cyclopean single eye and other deformities. The culprit, identified 10 years later, was a chemical called cyclopamine, found in the plant &lt;em&gt;Veratrum californicum&lt;/em&gt;, which the sheep were eating. Drought had driven them to higher pastures where the plant was growing. In the 1980s, cyclopamine was shown to block sonic hedgehog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We saw an equivalent case in humans with the drug thalidomide. Widely prescribed to pregnant women in Europe between 1957 and 1961 as a treatment for nausea, the drug interfered with the working of sonic hedgehog. Before thalidomide was withdrawn, it caused all manner of birth defects, including hands that grew from the shoulders. But even in normal development, sonic hedgehog sometimes gets it wrong: people with six or seven digits occur in one out of 700-1000 live births.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;"Just a very large clitoris"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If morphogens and hox genes can seem a bit abstract, the way that nature sculpts an animal comes vividly into focus when we get to the business end: the genitals. &amp;ldquo;La diff&amp;eacute;rence&amp;rdquo; maybe, but in developmental terms the male and female genitals are really all of a piece, woven from the same tissue. Only very small changes at the molecular level distinguish the male testosterone from the female oestrogen. It&amp;rsquo;s quite hard to spot the difference unless you&amp;rsquo;re a chemist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the developing foetus, it is the sex hormones, acting as morphogens, that build either the female or male genitalia from the same original tissues. In the early embryo, the primordial organs, so far undifferentiated, become male or female depending on the signal from one or other of the so-similar hormones. Once development has finished, switching hormones can accentuate or diminish secondary sexual characteristics but they cannot reverse the plumbing. That requires surgery. So it&amp;rsquo;s either labia or scrotum, clitoris or penis, ovaries or testes (which are formed in the male in the same place in the stomach as the ovaries but which then descend into the scrotal sac). The default is the female form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that animal forms can only be produced by cells dividing and moving in one direction rather than another. So the scrotal sac is just a large hollow version of the labia, with a sealed seam where the vagina would be. Indeed, the whole appendage of which males are so proud is just a very large clitoris with the urethra diverted down the middle, and a connection to the testes and the prostate gland. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingenious plasticity of most of these processes is highlighted by the bizarre case of the spotted hyena, which gives birth through the clitoris. How evolution succeeded with this apparently grotesquely malformed plumbing is a mystery. Birth this way is hard: 60 per cent of the firstborn hyenas and 9 per cent of their mothers die at birth. It sounds like a challenge to Darwin, but despite its extreme reproductive strategy, the spotted hyena is an abundant, successful species. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The growth of an animal is a cascade: once it gets going, it can&amp;rsquo;t stop. But it can go wrong. Timing and positioning are a large part of the developmental process. Because many processes can only be turned on at the correct time in development, a wrong turn early on cannot later be made good. The reason that thalidomide wreaked such deadly and lasting damage is that the sonic hedgehog morphogen is busy patterning the limbs during weeks five and six of gestation, when the pregnant mothers were taking the drug. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as there is no one Secret of Life, many processes are brought to bear to hone and fine-tune the actions of morphogens like sonic hedgehog. Building an animal is a concerted job between the genes, the protein-signalling morphogens, the different kinds of cells they produce and the messenger molecules on their surfaces. There is a powerful analogy with language here. The linguist Guy Deutscher, in &lt;em&gt;The Unfolding of Language&lt;/em&gt; (2005), shows how language evolved its complexity by a process akin to biological evolution: &amp;ldquo;Languages have&amp;hellip; developed a range of&amp;hellip; techniques to help make the bricks stick, such as the use of various adhesives which facilitate the construction of much more complex edifices.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;From a single egg to the finished animal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our knowledge of how to build an animal is still very broad-brush. Recent work, reported in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine, sheds new light on the fine-tuning of the construction technique. Working with zebrafish, scientists have found that sonic hedgehog patterning is actually a bit sloppy, but that it interacts with and is fine-tuned by interactions with the proteins that stick cells together. These cell adhesion proteins also specify cell types and they make sure that the broad pattern laid down by sonic hedgehog, at least most of the time, produces the correct result. In the zebrafish experiment, they were found to produce the 13 pre-patterning &amp;ldquo;stripes&amp;rdquo; that parcel out the early spinal cord &amp;ndash; not only in zebrafish, but in all vertebrates. In humans they also ensure, most of the time, that we have 20 tiny fingers and 20 tiny toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the successful completion of the Human Genome Project, the international mission to map and understand our DNA, was announced at a White House press conference in 2000, President Clinton told the world that &amp;ldquo;Today we are learning the language in which God created life.&amp;rdquo; He said that the genome was the &amp;ldquo;book of life&amp;rdquo; which we could now decode &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;the most wondrous map ever produced by humankind&amp;rdquo;. In fact, the genome was only 83 per cent complete at the time. But even if it had been fully complete, as it is now, Clinton would have been jumping the gun. DNA is only one piece of the puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DNA sequence of any organism&amp;rsquo;s total complement of genes, the genome, is fundamental, but how it functions at different stages in the development &amp;ndash; from a single egg to the finished animal &amp;ndash; is intricately subtle. This article has covered a few prime examples of this. They were mostly surprises; many unknown unknowns still await us on this quest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So where do we find the Secret of Life? It turns out that there isn&amp;rsquo;t one. In evolving life&amp;rsquo;s complexity over four billion years, many processes have been deployed. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them &amp;ldquo;secrets&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ndash; although a growing number aren&amp;rsquo;t secrets any more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: The Wordhord</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5910/book-review-the-wordhord#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-_9_.jpg" height="515" alt="image" width="689" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wordhord: Daily Life in Old English&lt;/strong&gt; (Profile Books) by Hana Videen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does the &amp;ldquo;Old English&amp;rdquo; language really deserve the name? Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s old &amp;ndash; it was spoken in some form between the 6th and 12th centuries &amp;ndash; and sure, it&amp;rsquo;s the ancestor of the English we speak today. It was certainly spoken in England and the etymological link between the names of the Englisc and English language is also clear enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet to presume that the English we speak today is simply an updated version of the English spoken in the early mediaeval period risks obscuring the otherness of Old English. In fact, this Germanic language was transformed by contact with the Romance language of Norman French after 1066, creating the unique hybrid that we know today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wordhord&amp;rdquo; is an actual term from Old English literature. Heroes like Beowulf are said to &amp;ldquo;onleac&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;unlock&amp;rdquo;) their precious hoard of words on speaking at weighty, important occasions. Hana Videen&amp;rsquo;s book grew out of her tweeting an Old English word every day and there is an app accompanying &lt;em&gt;The Wordhord&lt;/em&gt; that allows users to browse selected treasures from her hoard of words. Her &amp;ldquo;hord-wynn&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;hoard-joy&amp;rdquo;) in sharing her precious treasures is infectious. But the book is more than just a list of words. She turns them into the story of how Old English speakers saw the world and what mattered to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes our Old English ancestors seem familiar, sometimes not. We encounter numerous &amp;ldquo;false friends&amp;rdquo; that do not lead us where we think we are going: &amp;ldquo;Drēam&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;joy&amp;rdquo;, and a &amp;ldquo;bēd-hūs&amp;rdquo; is a place of worship, not a dormitory. Where old and new align, the older might be more expansive: a &amp;ldquo;lēac&amp;rdquo; could be any plant, not just a leek, while a &amp;ldquo;dēor&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t only a deer but can be any animal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surviving Old English wordhord is modest in size. There are only 200 partially or wholly Old English manuscripts, the majority dating from the 10th and 11th centuries and containing some 3.5 million words. That means scholars like Videen are faced with numerous words or compounds that are only known from a single instance in a single manuscript. These do, however, include numerous suggestive compounds that are all the more precious for their uniqueness: &amp;ldquo;symbel-gāl&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;feast-lustful&amp;rdquo;, whereby one is so satiated from the pleasures of food and drink that they cannot focus on the state of their soul; or &amp;ldquo;ān-stapa&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;one-stepper&amp;rdquo;, a person who walks alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is compounds like this that are the most exciting finds in the book, particularly when they take the form of kennings. Kennings combine two ordinary nouns to create metaphors rich in allusive power. They range from the comic to the gnomic, including &amp;ldquo;bān-loca&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;bone-locker&amp;rdquo;, or body), &amp;ldquo;fisces be&amp;thorn;&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;fish&amp;rsquo;s bath&amp;rdquo;, or sea) and &amp;ldquo;gongle-wǣfre&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;walking weaver&amp;rdquo;, or spider).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Old English word-making&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But while Videen&amp;rsquo;s book allows us to appreciate the expressiveness and creativity of Old English word-making and literature, she largely avoids confronting the reader with a major source of Old English otherness. Languages are not simply wordhords, they require grammatical scaffolding. And it is grammatically that the impact of Norman French on English is seen most dramatically. Like other Germanic languages, Old English was an inflected language in which nouns and other words were marked by case &amp;ndash; suffixes that indicate the syntactical function of the word (in modern English, prepositions like &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;by&amp;rdquo; perform this function). The collision between Germanic and Romance largely swept cases away. When today&amp;rsquo;s native English speaker tries to learn Icelandic, German, Finnish &amp;ndash; or, for that matter, Old English &amp;ndash; it is the case system that provides one of the first challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Videen does not claim her book is a guide to Old English. Rather, as she states, it is for her a source of the &amp;ldquo;wynn-drēam&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; intense and visceral joy &amp;ndash; that comes from both connecting with the Old English-speaking past and mining that past to find new ways of expressing things that humans have always felt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoD is back in business!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
