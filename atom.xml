<p>The boy liked it, I enjoyed it, despite the controversy over casting Michael Keaton, he was excellent. It was grimmer, though.</p>
<p>There have been many Batman movies ever since, and they seem to demonstrate a terrible entropy, getting darker and grimmer and less enjoyable. It seems to be a trend.</p>

<p>I think I’m going to skip this one. The other movie playing in the <a href="https://morristheatre.net/blog/">Morris Theater</a> is something called <i>Dog</i>. It looks rather less gritty and dark and grim and bleak. I might just go see that.</p>

<p>Hey, how about if you demonstrate the existence of intelligent space-faring aliens before you start speculating about their motivations? But they’ve got a <em>scientist</em> who’s doing the speculating, and the Daily Mail loves scientists who agree with their biases.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Sci-fi films and TV shows have routinely depicted a brutal race of aliens visiting Earth in their spaceships and enslaving unfortunate Earthlings.  </p>
<p>But according to one expert, extraterrestrial life may actually be too scared of ‘dangerous’ and ‘violent’ humans to want to come here. </p>
<p>Dr Gordon Gallup, a biopsychologist at the University of Albany, argues that humans are ‘dangerous, violent and ceaselessly engage in endless bloody conflicts and war’. </p></blockquote>
<p>How do you become an expert in alien biopsychology, I’d like to know. We’re about to bottom out, though, since we’re about to learn where he published these claims.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Dr Gallup has presented his argument in an open access paper published in the Journal of Astrobiology this month.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Oh god. AiG, the Daily Mail, <em>and</em> the Journal of Astrobiology? Is this Dumpster Diving Friday or something? Have mercy. Here’s the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358629839_Extraterrestrial_Intelligence_A_Cognitive_Evolutionary_Perspective">abstract for the paper</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>We evaluate claims for extraterrestrial intelligence based on the logic behind assertions such as the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. To assess intelligence elsewhere in the universe we outline two of the principle scientific claims for intelligence on Earth. One involves the idea that intelligence involves working out the reasons for our own existence. The other involves self-awareness and the capacity to make inferences about what others know, want, or intend to do. The famous quote from Rene Descartes “I think; therefore, I am” needs to be revised to read “I am; therefore, I think.” Some of the conclusions we derive about intelligence include the idea that most species on planet Earth have clever brains but blank minds (no self-consciousness); humans are the only species where what you know could get you killed; if humans become extinct it is highly unlikely that human-like intelligence will re-emerge on this planet and the odds of human-like intelligence evolving on other worlds is infinitely small. However, if intelligence exists elsewhere in the universe it may not have revealed itself because humans are dangerous and are perceived as posing too great a risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d reject it out of hand for the blatant human exceptionalism and the false claims right there: <q>most species on planet Earth have clever brains but blank minds (no self-consciousness)</q>. Most species on Earth don’t have brains, for one, but additionally, have you met my cat? Not very clever, but definitely full of herself and quite aware of herself. There are a lot of claims in this abstract that the author does not adequately justify in the remainder of the opinion piece (it is not a scientific paper).</p>
<p>Then, in the first paragraph of the introduction, he cites <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/?s=rhawn+joseph">Rhawn Joseph three times. Ugh. He’s an affiliate member of the Panspermia Mafia, I think we’re done.</a></p>
<p>I couldn’t help myself. I took a quick look in the table of contents to see what ol’ Rhawn was up to now. He’s still poring over NASA’s Mars photos, drawing circles and arrows on them, to claim now that there are tube worms and crustaceans on Mars.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/russian-video-army">Right-wing media were orgasming over a Russian army recruitment ad</a> which portrayed Russian soldiers as these manly masculine macho dudes, and were contrasting that with the tolerant, diverse American army.

<p>Unfortunately, nothing has really changed. Now <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-ted-cruz-biden-mistakes/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">Ted Cruz is simultaneously saying we need to get tough on Russia, and blaming the Ukraine war on Biden</a>.</p>

    <title>Better to suffer with Shaun than with any more Rowling</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/03/04/better-to-suffer-with-shaun-than-with-any-more-rowling/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Whoa, this is a long video, an hour and 45 minutes long. It&amp;#8217;s worth it, though, and it&amp;#8217;s not so much a video as a monologue, so you can just plug in your earbuds and listen as you get other work done, like I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s Shaun talking about the Harry Potter universe. I&amp;#8217;ve never much cared for Potter &amp;#8212; I appreciated that it got my kids reading &amp;#8212; but I struggled myself to get through just the first couple of books, before they got so long and even more tedious. I also only got through the first few movies before giving up, and found them awfully unforgettable. It sounds like Shaun had the same impression of the stories that I did, but to research the video, he read &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the books, watched all the movies, including that terrible &lt;i&gt;Fantastic Beasts&lt;/i&gt; crap. Only then did he dig into this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1iaJWSwUZs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic message: Rowling is inherently conservative, opposed to any kind of systemic change, a neoliberal Blairite, and it shows in her stories. The most telling point is that she created a fantasy world with slavery, and none of the &amp;#8216;heroes&amp;#8217; even try to change it, except for Hermione, who is treated as an obsessive joke. In fact the whole arc of the whole series ends with the status quo preserved, only different players in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now I know why her books left me so cold, and I&amp;#8217;m glad I didn&amp;#8217;t push on to try and read them all. Poor Shaun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>"With Havana Syndrome, the US government has spent five years chasing ghosts"</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="A US flag on the dashboard of a car in Havana, Cuba (H. L. Tam / Flickr)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-03-at-10.51.31.jpg" height="954" alt="US flag Cuba" width="1330" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robert W. Baloh and Robert E. Bartholomew published &amp;ldquo;Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story Behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria&amp;rdquo; (Springer) in March 2020. Bartholomew is Honorary Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, and Baloh is a distinguished professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your book makes the argument that so-called &amp;ldquo;Havana syndrome&amp;rdquo;, whereby US officials and others claim to be victims of mysterious sonic or &amp;ldquo;pulsed energy&amp;rdquo; attacks by Cuba, is in fact nothing more than a mass psychogenic illness &amp;ndash; a form of mass hysteria in which symptoms are experienced as if they were real. What makes you so sure of this? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bartholomew:&lt;/strong&gt; There is not a shred of credible evidence that there ever were attacks. After five years, no weapon has been found and there is not a single intelligence intercept suggesting there was a weapon. While the US military has researched the use of acoustical and microwave weapons, they have not been able to develop a practical device due to the laws of physics. There is a big difference between researching something and developing a practical weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What therefore do you make of US claims that these &amp;ldquo;attacks&amp;rdquo; have produced, among others, brain damage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bartholomew:&lt;/strong&gt; The claims of brain damage, changes to white matter [nerve fibres found in the deep tissue of the brain] and hearing loss are the product of inaccurate reporting. In December 2017, information was leaked to the media about a study that was being conducted on US Embassy patients which showed mysterious white matter tract changes in their brains. Media outlets around the world reported on the strange &amp;ldquo;brain anomalies&amp;rdquo;. Then, in February 2018, the study appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt;. Yet only three of the patients exhibited white matter tract changes, which is the same distribution you would expect to find in a normal population because white matter changes are common in everything from depression to migraines to normal ageing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there were the reports of brain damage after the publication of a 2019 study in the same journal. Again, the story made headlines, with many media outlets reporting on the &amp;ldquo;brain damage&amp;rdquo; suffered by the diplomats. However, brain anomalies are not the same as brain damage. While they did find anomalies, it is not unusual to find minor anomalies in small patient cohorts due to individual variation, given they can be caused by exposure to long-term stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for reports of hearing loss, that never happened either. In 2018, the results of a study on US diplomats who were reportedly suffering from Havana Syndrome were leaked. The media was soon reporting that one-third of the patients in the study were experiencing hearing loss. However, when the study was published that December, only two patients had hearing loss, and in both cases, it had occurred &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they were even posted to Cuba. The remainder thought they had hearing loss, but when given a standard hearing test, it proved to be unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The head of one US association that represents current and former diplomats and foreign aid workers recently stated that victims have suffered &amp;ldquo;real trauma and real injury&amp;rdquo;. If it were indeed psychological, how could the consequences be so severe? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bartholomew: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass psychogenic illness symptoms are as real as any other medical condition, but their origin is non-organic. It is not just &amp;ldquo;all in their heads&amp;rdquo;. They are experiencing real symptoms and both Professor Baloh and I are sympathetic to their suffering. But telling them they have brain damage only exacerbates their condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Baloh&lt;/strong&gt;: The key difference is that there is no evidence of brain injury or brain damage. MRI scans of the brain have been normal and there are no neurological abnormalities on examination. The non-specific test abnormalities that have been reported are commonly seen in patients with stress-related neurological disorders such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There have now been some 1,000 cases of Havana Syndrome reported worldwide. How is it able to spread across geographies in the way it has? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Baloh&lt;/strong&gt;: In fact this is strong support for a diagnosis of psychogenic illness. Diplomatic and state department officials were warned to be on the outlook for symptoms and to immediately report them. This caused them to focus and ruminate on routine body symptoms that nearly everyone experiences. They developed negative expectations, called the &amp;ldquo;nocebo effect&amp;rdquo;, and by attending to the symptoms, the symptoms were amplified and required less activation for conscious awareness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bartholomew:&lt;/strong&gt; Like all outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness, you need to understand the context. You need to go back to patient zero. It began in a small unit of CIA officers in Havana in late 2016. For weeks they had been hearing mysterious sounds &amp;ndash; then one day one of them presented to the US Embassy clinic with a headache and ear pain, and a theory emerged that they were being harassed by a new acoustical weapon. The story then spread through the small CIA unit, and not long after, to the US and Canadian embassies which had a close relationship and were sharing information. The sonic attack hypothesis may seem like an odd assumption at first, but you have to put yourself in their shoes. The notion that they were harassed seemed plausible because there is a long history of Cuban agents harassing diplomats. For instance, during the Cold War, agents would sneak into their houses while they slept and rearrange furniture, leave cigarette butts on their kitchen table and open all the windows so the house would become filled with mosquitos. The diplomats who were sent to the new Embassy in Havana in 2015 had been briefed on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there&amp;rsquo;s an old saying: &amp;ldquo;When you hear the sounds of hoofbeats in the night, first think horses not zebras.&amp;rdquo; The doctors in the US State Department went for the most exotic hypothesis early on &amp;ndash; they were searching for unicorns when they should have stuck to more mundane explanations. Of the first 21 victims in Cuba, eight recorded their &amp;ldquo;attacks&amp;rdquo;, and a panel of scientists later concluded that the sounds aligned closely with the mating call of the Indies short-tailed cricket [an insect local to Cuba]!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One alleged cause of &amp;ldquo;Havana Syndrome&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; sound waves &amp;ndash; has been seen before in instances of mass psychogenic illness. Can you explain the brief life of &amp;ldquo;acoustic shock&amp;rdquo; in the early days of telephones? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Baloh:&lt;/strong&gt; Acoustic shock, which is discussed in detail in our book, has many parallels with Havana Syndrome. In the early days of telephones, people developed a wide spectrum of symptoms including headache, dizziness, tinnitus and brain fog after hearing a brief disturbing sound on a telephone. Typically, the sound, if recorded, was not that impressive. The condition was initially called an &amp;ldquo;ear concussion&amp;rdquo; even though there was no evidence of ear damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History is littered with stories of such mass hysterias: the dancing manias of the Middle Ages; the laughter epidemic in Tanzania in 1962; mass fainting at a school in Blackburn, England in 1965. What makes us susceptible to them? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bartholomew:&lt;/strong&gt; In a word: plausibility. There is an old saying: &amp;ldquo;Talk of the devil and he is bound to appear.&amp;rdquo; In Salem in 1692, a belief in the devil altered the perceptual sets of the local residents whose worldview included the reality of witches and demons. In Salem, when the cry of &amp;ldquo;Witch!&amp;rdquo; went up, believers went searching for evidence to confirm it. If someone visited and you fell sick soon after, it was evidence of witchcraft. It&amp;rsquo;s not that dissimilar to Havana Syndrome because many of the symptoms are so vague as to be experienced by nearly everyone on the planet in any given week: fatigue, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, insomnia, dizziness, confusion, disorientation, ear pressure and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Baloh:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the human brain is a remarkable organ, it has &amp;ldquo;design flaws&amp;rdquo; that make it vulnerable to suggestion and manipulation. Advertisers and politicians routinely take advantage of these flaws to influence our behaviour with regards to purchases and voting. These design flaws can be traced to both nature and nurture. Many of our emotions and behaviours are ingrained in the primitive deep brain modules encoded by genes that evolved over millions of years of evolution. We are susceptible to irrational fears that can change the chemistry and physiology of our brain and body, leading to a wide range of symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US government officials don&amp;rsquo;t exactly fit the typical profile of victims of mass hysteria, who are often either young or not informed by western science and medicine. What conditions in their line of work might have produced it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Baloh: &lt;/strong&gt;First, these are common misperceptions about victims of mass psychogenic illness, in part due to &amp;ldquo;historical baggage&amp;rdquo; associated with the word &amp;ldquo;hysteria&amp;rdquo;. Mass psychogenic illness can affect anyone regardless of age, gender or level of education. It often begins in close-knit groups living in stressful situations and is amplified by politics and cultural beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bartholomew:&lt;/strong&gt; We do not claim that victims of psychogenic illness are &amp;ldquo;crazy&amp;rdquo;, mentally ill or are psychologically weak. It is a collective stress response that is based on a belief. We all have beliefs, and therefore everyone is potentially susceptible. That includes highly trained and well-educated intelligence officers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While CIA agents appear to have been over-represented as victims, that is readily explainable. In Havana, intelligence agents were viewed as the first targets and intelligence officers around the world were warned that they might be next, thus resulting in agents being hyperaware of their health and creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is important to remember that not every victim is experiencing mass psychogenic illness. Many are simply redefining an array of common and uncommon health conditions under a new label: &amp;ldquo;Havana Syndrome&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might the US government be so resistant to accepting that this could be the work of something other than a hostile state? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bartholomew:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe that embarrassment is a big factor. It is embarrassing to think that they have spent five years chasing ghosts, and in the process, wasted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating claims of an imaginary secret weapon that turned out to be the mating calls of crickets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Baloh: &lt;/strong&gt;They have also backed themselves into a corner, having strongly supported the notion of an attack by a hostile state from the very onset. Some politicians have demanded retaliation even though we have no idea who to retaliate against. Other politicians have specifically used the foreign attack theory to further their agenda against Cuba. Furthermore, &amp;ldquo;victims&amp;rsquo; groups&amp;rdquo; have powerful political allies and they refuse to even consider the possibility of psychogenic illness. Even mentioning the term can lead to immediate sanctioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a range of potentially serious outcomes &amp;ndash; both political and scientific &amp;ndash; that arise from this. In what ways could it prove consequential beyond just being a matter of intrigue? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Baloh: &lt;/strong&gt;Obvious political consequences are the breakdown in relations with Cuba and possible future actions against other countries despite the lack of evidence of an &amp;ldquo;attack&amp;rdquo;. With regards to the &amp;ldquo;victims&amp;rdquo; of the proposed attacks, telling them that they have brain damage caused by some type of mysterious weapon is a prescription for a life with chronic debilitating symptoms. Their symptoms are real but they need to be reassured that they do not have permanent brain damage and that they can be treated and get well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Bartholomew:&lt;/strong&gt; The real danger that this case poses is to highlight the potential for politics to become mixed with science. The implications are enormous, from vaccination uptake to global warming. The effectiveness of vaccines and the reality of global warming are settled science, but in the social media and fake news age, misinformation abounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>White fright in America</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5928/white-fright-in-america#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The Jan 6 2021 Capitol Hill mob (Flickr/Tyler Merbler)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol_09__cropped_.jpg" height="545" alt="The Jan 6 2021 Capitol Hill mob" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever since 6 January 2021, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol, pundits have busily questioned who exactly were the people who engineered what many consider to be one of the darkest moments in US political history. The photos of the mob offered little clarity: one man wore horns and animal fur, others wore militia uniforms; still others looked as if they&amp;rsquo;d breezed in off the streets. Speculation tended to take the place of hard data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;University of Chicago researchers have now given a clearer view of the profile of participants, and it complicates traditional assumptions of the nature and make-up of far-right movements. They were largely middle-class, and included doctors, CEOs and other white-collar professionals. In other words, they came from the mainstream of US society, not from an aggrieved economic fringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt; magazine in January, also shows that for all the diversity of backgrounds, one anxiety united most of those present: that of an ascendent non-white majority. More than half of the 716 people arrested or charged for the insurrection, the report said, &amp;ldquo;come from counties [in the US] where the white share of the population is declining fastest&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their fears align with a conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement, popularised a decade ago by Renaud Camus. Camus was a former darling of the French left, a prolific gay writer whose earlier work was feted by Allen Ginsberg, Roland Barthes and others, but who, by the late 1990s, had come to see evidence of &amp;ldquo;ethnic and civilisational substitution&amp;rdquo; underway in western countries. One day, in rural southern France, he saw the &amp;ldquo;replacement&amp;rdquo; materialise before him. &amp;ldquo;You would go to a fountain, six or seven centuries old, and there were all these North African women with veils!&amp;rdquo; he told the New Yorker in 2017. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His ideas already had an audience in France &amp;ndash; far-right leader Marine Le Pen had asked in 2011: &amp;ldquo;How could we be satisfied to see our adversaries continue their work of moral and economic ruin of the country, to let it be taken over by an organised replacement of our population?&amp;rdquo; But they were quickly taken up by white supremacists elsewhere who saw demographic shifts in the US and Europe as proof of a catastrophic upending of supposedly age-old hierarchies. Trump played heavily into this fear with his so-called &amp;ldquo;Muslim ban&amp;rdquo; (Camus believes that white Europeans are under particular threat from Muslims). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The urge to protect a national white majority has led to other regressive ideas. Alain de Benoist, who founded the New Right in France in the 1960s, is credited with birthing the identitarian movement via his promotion of an isolationist interpretation of diversity &amp;ndash; that in order for supposedly discrete cultures to not become homogenised into non-existence, French people should stay in one country, Algerians in another, and so on. Identitarianism has come to be seen as the acceptable face of white supremacy, not just in France, but in the UK, the US and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precise grip that Great Replacement theory holds on American voters isn&amp;rsquo;t clear. We do know that much support for Trump was propelled by powerful fears, imagined or not, that the United States many knew is disappearing. This evidently hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone away: one US poll in January put support for Trump at 51 per cent (most polls however put it between 30 and 45 per cent). If he does run for office in 2024, he&amp;rsquo;ll surely play to those fears once more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warnings of a &amp;ldquo;white genocide&amp;rdquo;, the supposed end-result of the Great Replacement, are of course preposterous. Yet three-quarters of the 6 January 2021 insurrectionists believed that the Democratic Party is playing a central role in the &amp;ldquo;replacement&amp;rdquo; of white Americans. One might pass them off as an extreme interest group, but as the latest research shows, the profile of radical political movements in the US is changing, as it is elsewhere, and some previously fringe ideas are no longer so fringe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the Witness section of our New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Michael Ignatieff and the redemptive power of consolation</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5935/michael-ignatieff-and-the-redemptive-power-of-consolation#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Marcus Tullius Cicero, who wrote Consolatio in 45 BC (&amp;Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek - Austrian National Library)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-02-24-at-12.46.13.jpg" height="907" alt="Cicero" width="1149" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is something &amp;ldquo;anti-Descartian&amp;rdquo; about consolation: I feel, therefore I am. While we all think more or less the same (there are many people and few ideas), when I stub my toe, only I feel the pain. Even more significant, when my heart breaks, it&amp;rsquo;s only my world that crumbles. &amp;ldquo;The basis of the self is not thought,&amp;rdquo; wrote Czech novelist Milan Kundera, &amp;ldquo;but suffering,&amp;rdquo; which he considered the &amp;ldquo;most fundamental of feelings&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fundamental or not, suffering alone cannot dictate our state of being. Equally important is how we cope with grief and misery, how we console ourselves and grow and learn. Through that redemptive process, consolation has immeasurably shaped art, politics and religion. Giving form to that immeasurability was the task Canadian author and historian Michael Ignatieff set himself in his latest book, &lt;em&gt;On Consolation&lt;/em&gt;. Looking at 17 historical figures, from the prophet Job to Abraham Lincoln to the 20th century doctor Cicely Saunders, he draws a beautifully clear map of how the search for consolation has evolved throughout the centuries and come to define the worth of human life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late 2021 I visited Ignatieff at his loaned flat in Vienna&amp;rsquo;s stately Josefstadt district. Snug in his study, Ignatieff easily assumed the role of the boffin, holding court over a cluttered desk dominated by a sepia globe, the walls behind him hung with esoteric artwork and an antique map of Venice. His own books occupied almost an entire shelf of that bookcase, their topics a wide variety of philosophic subjects: pain, honour, human rights, morality, and empire. But it could be said the search for solace has been his longest pursuit, forming a solid basis for some of his best work, from 1985&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Needs of Strangers&lt;/em&gt;, through 1987&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Russian Album&lt;/em&gt;, to 2017&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Ordinary Virtues&lt;/em&gt;. His prior enquiries prepared him well, and make &lt;em&gt;On Consolation&lt;/em&gt; a thorough examination of how the sentiment we know as consolation came about, and how it has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the book&amp;rsquo;s germ, Ignatieff recalled a choral performance of the Psalms staged in Utrecht. &amp;ldquo;I began to wonder why a non-believer like me would be moved and comforted and possibly consoled by religious language,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;That sent me to look at the Psalms in detail, and the Hebrew Bible, and Saint Paul, and on and on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was before the Covid-19 pandemic, and his preoccupation with consolation seemed strange to friends and family, who assumed some tragedy had befallen him. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t, though he admitted to being drawn to moments of &amp;ldquo;real loss, real bewildering, disabling loss&amp;hellip;the moments that flatten you.&amp;rdquo; He paused, as though realising it sounded somewhat desperate, adding, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m a depressive character, and I don&amp;rsquo;t wish to imply so. Life is pretty damn good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a strong vein of positivity that runs through the book. Consolation might imply a dour topic, and there are moments of desperation in the book&amp;mdash;imprisonment, death, sickness. But consolation is more accurately an act of hope and confidence, a definitive act of pulling oneself out of sadness. Ignatieff isn&amp;rsquo;t pedalling any feel-good remedies, and makes it clear early on that suffering isn&amp;rsquo;t something that can be avoided, let alone cured, even as society treats it as &amp;ldquo;an illness from which we need to recover&amp;rdquo;. One has a sense, speaking to Ignatieff, that he has become what Kundera called &lt;em&gt;homo sentimentalis&lt;/em&gt;, someone who has raised feelings&amp;mdash;even negative ones&amp;mdash;to a category of value. &amp;ldquo;Comfort is transitory,&amp;rdquo; he writes. &amp;ldquo;Consolation is enduring.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Consolation&lt;/em&gt; threads together the revelations and wisdom of Marcus Aurelius, David Hume, Mahler, and others. &amp;ldquo;I began to see those connections, the most obvious one being Boethius, who faced death at the hands of the Barbarian king, inspiring Dante, who was similarly in exile in the same city, who then, in turn, inspired Primo Levi in Auschwitz.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Ignatieff holds up art as a timeless tenant of consolation, the book is also concerned with the limits of everyday language. &amp;ldquo;Words,&amp;rdquo; he writes, &amp;ldquo;just fall apart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think we&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced that when we try to console someone who is heartbroken,&amp;rdquo; Ignatieff said. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no generic loss, there&amp;rsquo;s only loss for you and loss for me. And that means empathy is crucial to consolation. But anyone who tries to console finds this is where words break down, where silence descends over a room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Over and over again in these chapters, people are reflecting on the limits of words. Cicero writes these letters consoling other people &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Consolatio&lt;/em&gt; [a philosophical work by Cicero] is [part of] a positive genre in the Roman stoic tradition &amp;ndash; and then he loses his daughter. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most distressing moments in life, and it&amp;rsquo;s where empathy comes to its limits, where words come to their limits, where meaning comes to its limits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The limits of what others can provide is one of the clearest messages of the book, and put me in mind of the difference between &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say&amp;rdquo; and the crueller &amp;ldquo;What do you want me to say?&amp;rdquo; We are, Ignatieff suggests, caught between our desire to be comforted by others, and the necessity of consoling ourselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The figures in &lt;em&gt;On Consolation&lt;/em&gt; exist at pivot points in history, when the promise of a divine afterlife was found wanting. Their works of writing, art, and music have pushed the western world towards secularism and an age when religion has yielded most of its power to foretell a better future to science and politics. But given our current governmental and climatic crises, are science and politics too gloomy to provide the consolation once afforded by religious faith?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe the Armageddon narrative,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Not only do I not believe it, I think it&amp;rsquo;s pernicious and disabling. It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to hear our species described as a virus, as a parasite, and a plague upon the earth. I like the human race. Who else is going to fix this?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a note he found to be struck again and again throughout history, that the essential element of consolation is hope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wondered how the project has changed his outlook on humanity, and the future. He fell silent for a long moment, then said &amp;ldquo;The whole project made me much more hostile to ideology and political faith itself than I ever thought I would be. It made me much more pragmatic &amp;ndash; let&amp;rsquo;s go with what works, and cut the talk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we parted, I asked if he had any advice for those seeking consolation today. His face bore an expression like pain, his eyebrows, still dark where his hair has lightened to grey, tilting together and one cheek pulling into a half-smile. &amp;ldquo;You have to have patience with yourself. You have to give yourself a break sometimes. You can&amp;rsquo;t think yourself out of certain holes. You can&amp;rsquo;t write yourself out of certain holes. You can&amp;rsquo;t play yourself out of certain pits. You just have to let time do its work, and you have to have faith that you&amp;rsquo;ll get through it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Leaving Lviv</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5938/leaving-lviv#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Lviv in Ukraine, where the writer lived for two years (Sergei Gussev / Wikimedia Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Lviv__50856519306_.jpg" height="911" alt="Lviv in Ukraine" width="1215" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning I awoke at dawn expecting war. A quick click on Twitter confirmed my worst fears. &amp;ldquo;Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes&amp;rdquo;, tweeted the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba. &amp;ldquo;This is a war of aggression and Ukraine must defend itself and will win," Ukraine's foreign minister added. &amp;ldquo;The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why didn't I leave sooner? As an Irish citizen, I'm privileged in having that option. I moved to Lviv, two and a half years ago, while trying to finish a novel. An affordable, picturesque city that sits on the crossroads between Europe and the Russian-speaking world, it seemed like the perfect destination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that time, the city has become my home. Once an important regional outpost of the Habsburg empire, Lviv has always been culturally closer to Vienna than Moscow. But since the 2014 Maidan Revolution, it has become visibly pro-European, as Ukraine attempts to move away from its Soviet past. The use of the Ukrainian language in the public cultural and civic life of the city has been a particularly important of that process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don't claim to be an expert on these matters. To my shame, I have little knowledge of the Ukrainian language. Yet I've also made good friends here. With Lviv locals, with people in Kyiv, and with Europeans and Americans in Lviv with similar literary and cultural interests. When the drums of war started beating, I didn't know if I should stay or go. In mid February the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, in Dublin, told all Irish citizens it was no longer safe to stay in the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ignored the advice. Leaving in a panic seemed drastic. Also, the close bonds I had built in Lviv had become important to me. Especially as a war seemed increasingly likely. Our friendships had strengthened during the last few months. Finally, however, I booked a flight leaving Ukraine on Sunday. On Wednesday evening, however, I was checking Twitter every minute or so. My bags were packed, but I wondered if the weekend would be too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;***&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just after 8am on Thursday, with three bags and my passport packed, I decided it was best to get out sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I opened the door of my flat I saw my neighbour across the hallway. &amp;ldquo;You are leaving,&amp;rdquo; she said.&amp;ldquo;Well, I hope everything will be okay.&amp;rdquo; I said an awkward goodbye and then boarded the number 1 tram on the outskirts of Lviv. Heading down Lychakivska Street there was long lines of people outside ATMs, frantically withdrawing cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Passing by Lviv Town hall in Rynok Square I heard the sound of emergency aerial bomb sirens. I messaged a good friend in Kyiv on WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stay safe,&amp;rdquo; I wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stay alive,&amp;rdquo; she replied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Lviv-Holovnyi railway station at 9am crowds congregated calmly in the main hall looking for a ticket promising a way out of war. The mood was stoic, and quietly respectful. My train to Przemyśl, Poland, 114 kilometers from Lviv, was due to leave at 11am.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two hours later the train station in Lviv was eerily empty, with no sign of moving transport. More Ukrainian military arrived outside the station in trucks, smoking cigarettes, unpacking their equipment. The emergency bomb sirens rang out in the distance. I messaged my friends who were fleeing to the Polish border by car. &amp;ldquo;We are a bit stuck,&amp;rdquo; one of them explained. &amp;ldquo;We might have to abandon the car and walk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The train finally left Lviv just before 4pm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;***&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 6pm, I was in Poland, where the press eagerly awaited the first contingent of war-fleeing migrants. I set up camp in Przemyśl train station, near the border, surrounded by others who had fled the country, and settled down for the night. We lay on deck chairs and texted our loved ones. A small, cute, ruddy cheeked infant laughed in front of me and made me smile. Her grandmother silently wept across the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Polish military handed out soup, coffee, bread, water, and chocolate to all arrivals. The cross-European tolerance, decency, and solidarity was reassuring; proof, if any more was needed, of why Ukraine wants to turn west. The hospitality continued the next day, on the train south to the capital, Krak&amp;oacute;w. More free water, fruit, sandwiches and smiles from the Poles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But on Friday afternoon the news coming from Kyiv was not good. Ukrainian officials urged residents to take shelter from advancing Russian forces, as Vladimir Putin encouraged them to take the capital by force. Another friend told me she was going to spend the night with her boyfriend at one of Kyiv's metro stations, hiding from rocket fire. Like tens of thousands of fellow Ukrainians, she was heading west towards Lviv, and then to the Polish border. But the exit strategy was getting harder and harder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An acquaintance in Lviv told me the city was becoming unsafe. &amp;ldquo;There are rumours of a full scale Russian bombing on the city, he said. &amp;ldquo;And people are regularly going to bomb shelters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 6am Saturday morning another friend texted from Kyiv. Her 60-year-old uncle was preparing to go fight with a rifle on the capital's front line to defend Ukraine, she said. &amp;ldquo;Night was very hard,&amp;rdquo; she told me. &amp;ldquo;There was many explosions just a few km from me for hours. Not going now to railway as there are shootings and street fights not far from me and railway, I'm also still hearing explosions from time to time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Russians just bombed the airport close to my place&amp;rdquo; she added. &amp;ldquo;And got to a civil building too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miraculously, she managed to board a train a few hours later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Saturday afternoon in Krak&amp;oacute;w, I met some fo my Lviv friends for lunch. It had taken them 24 hours to cross from Lviv into Poland. They were sleep deprived and trying to maintain their sanity. Finding ourselves suddenly in Poland with a war raging in the east, we all began to ask the question: &lt;em&gt;where to next? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some talked of staying in Krak&amp;oacute;w. Others mention going to Prague, maybe Berlin, or even Copenhagen. In these uncertain times, however, most plans weren't going beyond the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I texted my friend in Kyiv again to see if the train had safely reached Lviv. It had. &amp;ldquo;You must be glad you finally made the decision to flee,&amp;rdquo; I wrote. &amp;ldquo;No," came the response. "I am scared for my family and what happens to them and that I will never see them alive again,&amp;rdquo; she wrote. &amp;ldquo;There are no words to describe all the bombings and the horror of the situation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;***&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Saturday at dusk, in Krak&amp;oacute;w's beautiful Old Town, we joined a hundred or so Ukrainians on a peaceful public demonstration. Some were refugees. Others were Ukrainians, long-term residents of the Polish city. We walked behind and joined in with the continual chanting, the demand for a No Fly Zone to stop the Russian airstrikes, including the shelling of residential neighbourhoods. &amp;ldquo;Close the sky, close the sky, close the sky.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One American-Ukrainian friend from Lviv broke down in tears beside me. Her grandparents had fled to the west from Lviv after the Soviets occupied the city at the end of the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"History repeating itself," we said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That night we took a drink in a dive bar in Krak&amp;oacute;w. I read on Twitter how the Pravda Beer Brewery in Lviv had suspended all production of alcohol. It was now making Molotov cocktails instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We spent most of the night on our phones making contact with friends in Lviv and Kyiv. The news was moving fast and much of it was coming via Facebook and Whats App groups. Anyone who had left Lviv was offering their free apartments to fellow refugees fleeing from various other Ukrainian cities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A small network of war-time bonding was building in real time. Most of the talk returned to Putin's next possible military moves. Some said they felt sick even looking at the news. At midnight I tried to sleep in my hostel. On my Twitter feed I looked on in horror, as Kyiv and Kharkiv lit up in a ball of orange flame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sunday afternoon, I boarded a bus from Krak&amp;oacute;w to Budapest. It was mostly Ukrainian refugees on board. I struggled to understand my relationship to them. As an Irish citizen forced to leave my home of two and a half years, am I also a refugee? I do not speak their language. I also had the privilege of being able to plan my departure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all left Ukraine, suddenly, for the same reason: war. But their loss would be much greater than mine. That much I knew. Some might lose homes, family members even. The country they return to will have witnessed great horror, whatever changes it achieves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we passed over the snow-capped mountains, into Stanica, Slovakia, a Ukrainian woman beside me took a phone call, speaking in English. It appeared she was speaking to a man who was paralysed by panic. &amp;ldquo;Go to the Polish border now," she was telling him. "You need to move quick. But remember, it's women and children who go first,&amp;rdquo; she added. &amp;ldquo; And in any case, Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 cannot leave Ukraine because of martial law ... You must be patient and trust in God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the bus, I befriended a woman from Kyiv in her mid 20s who was sat beside me. She spent most of the journey on her phone watching live speeches from President Zelensky, on the strength of the Ukrainian resistance, and sanctions on Russia applied by the west, along with their contributions of military support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I feel I already want to return to Ukraine, and help my country out somehow,&amp;rdquo; she told me. When the driver announced there was a ten minute break, we bought a coffee and smoked a cigarette. &amp;ldquo;Maybe we could find a church and pray,&amp;rdquo; she said. But there was no time. So we went back to the bus as darkness fell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sunday evening I made contact again with my friend in Kyiv who had fled for Poland on Saturday morning. &amp;ldquo;I think I'm having a nervous breakdown,&amp;rdquo; she wrote to me, just after she crossed the Polish border at Przemyśl . &amp;ldquo;I got to Lviv and there was a huge clash of people trying to get the train to Poland to escape. Instead of the normal 2 hour train, we spent 24 hours on a train without a toilet and the ability to sit or stand properly, and now I'm just sitting here crying.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, I was in central Budapest. When I bought a coffee outside my hostel on the central street of Dob Utca, most people around me were speaking Ukrainian, dragging their suitcases. I checked my Twitter feed. The UN claimed up to 368,000 have already left Ukraine since Thursday. It's estimated that up to 4 million could leave in what is shaping up to be the most devastating conflict on European soil since 1945.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I messaged my friend in Kyiv again, discussing possible options, as she moves on from Poland. &amp;ldquo;I know it must be hard to plan ahead after what you have been through,&amp;rdquo; I wrote, &amp;ldquo;but you should try and think of what you are going to do short term, and what the easiest safest options are for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I feel like it's a bad dream,&amp;rdquo; she replied. &amp;ldquo;Like in a few days I'll be able to go back home to my ordinary life, to my parents, to walks, and to nice coffees,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;My mind refuses to accept this new reality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I boarded a train to Zagreb. Snow fell, as it passed Lake Balaton in the Transdanubian region of Hungary. Movement felt like a distraction. Or a coping mechanism of sorts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;***&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;My intended destination is Sarajevo. But I have no real plan. I'll most likely spend my days on Twitter, watching a conflict from afar that's becoming more brutal and unpredictable with each passing day. There's now a scary realisation that this is no small-scale war. Europe and the wider world, meanwhile, look on with horror. Now I have a little time to reflect on my journey, I remember that initial sense of relief on crossing the border to Poland. It didn't last for long.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Gods of the green fields</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5936/gods-of-the-green-fields#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2CAATC3.jpg" height="787" alt="Marcelo Bielsa" width="1181" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Soon after taking over in 1961, Leeds United manager Don Revie became obsessed with the idea that his football ground was haunted. The club wasn&amp;rsquo;t reaching its potential, while the players kept on choking when it really mattered. Revie invited a medium to &amp;ldquo;cleanse&amp;rdquo; the space of evil spirits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;For a while, it seemed to have worked. By the end of the 1963-64 season, Leeds had been promoted to the First Division (now the Premier League). But, in keeping with previous years, they missed out on the title by goal difference, finishing second. Revie became convinced that a curse had been placed on the club.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;One might pass Revie&amp;rsquo;s actions off as the work of a paranoid mind. Yet they fit squarely within a longstanding tradition of football being elevated to the level of the spiritual. We might even go so far as to say that football is an opium of the people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;A hundred years ago, the pioneering sociologist Emile Durkheim argued that religion emerged through communal living, while the earliest faiths were based not on cosmogonies, but the worship of sacred symbols, or &amp;ldquo;totems&amp;rdquo;, that expressed the values of a tribe itself. Tribesmen wore their coats of arms about their body, much like football fans today wear shirts, face paint and badges bearing their club&amp;rsquo;s logos and colours. And like the single community that constitutes a church, football stadiums and other such venues offer physical locations where abstract values can be embodied through ceremony, ritual and symbolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;According to Durkheim, early social rituals were an &amp;ldquo;eminently collective thing&amp;rdquo;. The devotee confused the effervescent feeling of a social life greater than him or herself with an experience of divinity. The most obvious manifestation of this in football is the tendency among fans to see players as figures to worship &amp;ndash; saints, if not gods. After all, Diego Maradona even has a religion founded in his name:&lt;em&gt; Iglesia Maradoniana&lt;/em&gt;, or the Church of Maradona.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But if, among devoted fans, football clubs are churches, then what does that make their managers? The recent tumultuous history of Leeds United shows us how the way in which clubs are run &amp;ndash; making use of myth and ritual &amp;ndash; can impact and transform the psyches of players and fans, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;Don Revie and the cult of money&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Don Revie, as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, was a deeply superstitious man. The medium was only the beginning. During the course of his leadership from 1961 to 1974, he invited a fortune teller to urinate on the four corners of the pitch, and scrapped the club&amp;rsquo;s nickname of the &amp;ldquo;Peacocks&amp;rdquo; and the owl on its badge out of a fear of feathered creatures. His actions revealed the mindset of an insecure and determined manager, but there was something much deeper at work in his turn to the irrational.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Revie knew that the fortunes of Leeds United were central to the city&amp;rsquo;s concept of itself. As Anthony Clavane describes in his cultural history of the club, &lt;em&gt;Promised Land: A Northern Love Story,&lt;/em&gt; Leeds players aligned themselves with the concerns of upwardly mobile, inwardly anxious northern men, just like Don Revie himself, who could never quite reconcile where he came from with who he wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;His Leeds came to be reviled as nasty cheaters, intent on winning whatever the method. Don Revie&amp;rsquo;s had become a blind faith in money and success at all costs, a creed that seemed to infect the club. By the new millennium, Leeds United was engaging in a reckless spending spree which took them to the heights of footballing Europe, matching the city&amp;rsquo;s swagger as a regenerated financial centre and &amp;ldquo;Knightsbridge of the North&amp;rdquo;. But the owners and players had banked on the club attaining regular Champions League football to fund their lavish new lifestyle. They didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The club imploded spectacularly. They sold their best players, got relegated, went into administration, got relegated again, and spent 15 years in the wilderness, a kind of Ozymandias. The biggest one-city club in Europe lay wrecked in the desert of the third tier of English football, its cracked visage standing as a warning of the hubris of living beyond your means.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;I asked Clavane about the club&amp;rsquo;s history and how it feeds into the idea of sport-as-religion. He described Leeds, both city and club, as perennial underachievers longing for salvation. By 2018, he told me, &amp;ldquo;Leeds needed an outsider to come in and turn [its] world &amp;ndash; the club&amp;rsquo;s and city&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; upside down.&amp;rdquo; And that is exactly what happened: &lt;em&gt;call and he will answer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;Believing in the team&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;Walk the streets of Leeds today and you will see murals of a man who has eschewed the trappings of his wealth, who turned down residence in a luxury hotel in favour of living in a one-bedroom flat, who appeared at exclusive black-tie dinners wearing a tracksuit, and who once bought a car as a prize for the staff Christmas raffle. You may have heard him called many names: El Loco, The Professor, The Bucket Man. To Leeds United fans, Marcelo Bielsa is simply known as God.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;An Argentinian, Bielsa transformed the club and brought a new source of pride to the city. He did so, in part, by applying a new set of beliefs to Leeds United. Where the religion of the market would dictate that players should have been sold and &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; products bought, Bielsa kept nearly all of those from the season prior to his arrival. While past managers had put their trust in money, El Loco (&amp;ldquo;The Crazy One&amp;rdquo;) appeared to have faith in his players, in their capacity not just to make mistakes but to make amends, to learn, to improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;On the first game of the 2018-19 season, Leeds emerged &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt; to blow away Stoke City &amp;ndash; favourites to be promoted to the Premier League &amp;ndash; with a brand of free-flowing, high-pressing, life-affirming football that would become the hallmark of Bielsa&amp;rsquo;s Leeds. In 2020, when they marched back to the Premier League, players long seen as write-offs quickly corrected their critics. Patrick Bamford became the second highest scoring Englishman behind Harry Kane, while Kalvin Phillips went from a squad player to playing every game of England&amp;rsquo;s march to the Euro 2020 final, hailed by former England manager Fabio Capello as the &amp;ldquo;best modern midfielder&amp;rdquo; in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Like Don Revie before him, Bielsa made use of those same tools of myth, ritual and religion. Like Revie, he had his eccentricities: the blue line he had painted between his flat and the training ground so he could focus his mind on football rather than navigation; the insane levels of preparation, which included the 19 hours he spent analysing footage of a single youth team prospect, as well as managing the under-12s during the off season and producing an eight-page dossier on a third-choice goalkeeper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But the principles behind Bielsa&amp;rsquo;s managerial style came from a very particular place. A devout Catholic, while manager of Athletic Bilbao in Spain he took a trip to the St Clare Convent in Guernica. There, he prayed with the &amp;ldquo;Poor Clares&amp;rdquo;, an austere and ascetic order of nuns within the Roman Catholic Church that are devoted to prayer, penance, contemplation and manual work. He was so struck by his brief time at the convent that in a subsequent game he placed a sign emblazoned with &amp;ldquo;Poor Clares&amp;rdquo; near the manager&amp;rsquo;s dugout, before a stadium official had it removed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;In fact, &amp;ldquo;Bielsaball&amp;rdquo;, the name fans gave the manager&amp;rsquo;s underlying style and approach, seemed very much like a secularised version of liberation theology. This Catholic movement, founded in Latin America in the 1960s, saw the church as duty-bound to help the poor and bring about the potential of all through liberation from oppression. The dignity of every human, the importance of family, community and participation, of rights and responsibilities &amp;ndash; these values have found modern-day expression in the spirit of team sports and in Leeds United.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;Goodbye to a secular saint&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;But does this impulse have to be thought of as religious? We could also view Bielsa&amp;rsquo;s attitude as rooted in a humanistic belief in people as ends in and of themselves. It is not a coincidence that the people of Leeds share something of the values of two clubs that are similarly close to Bielsa&amp;rsquo;s heart: Athletic Bilbao and Newell&amp;rsquo;s Old Boys, whom he managed early on in his career. Like Leeds, their core support base hails from post-industrial towns where passion and hard work, and the will to self-improvement, are as central to life in the workplace as they are in the football stands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As clubs around the world move toward private equity ownership and new markets, it is the identification fans have with their clubs &amp;ndash; essentially human passions expressed through ritual and the possibility of competition &amp;ndash; that is most at risk. On the eve of the planned departure of the Big Six clubs from the Premier League to the Super League in April 2021 &amp;ndash; a move which placed the profit motive at the heart of the sport &amp;ndash; Bielsa grew reflective. &amp;ldquo;One of the reasons football is the most popular sport in the world is because the weak can beat the powerful,&amp;rdquo; he said. And he turned out to be right. Backlash from supposedly &amp;ldquo;disempowered&amp;rdquo; fans led the plans for the Super League to be shelved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It took an outsider, an eccentric, a man with the cult following of a secular saint, to unleash the potential of Leeds United and reveal the talent that was there all along. Bielsa is no longer manager of Leeds United. But we can still learn from El Loco and his &amp;ldquo;mad belief&amp;rdquo; that football&amp;rsquo;s value lies not in rapacious capitalism or winning-at-all-costs, but in working-class communities, the bonds between human beings, and the faith placed in their inherent capacity for improvement. It may not be such a crazy idea after all.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Someone contacted me hoping to find young atheists who might be interested in being part of a new series.
