&lt;p&gt;No. Just no. I don&amp;#8217;t want this anywhere. Fortunately, it&amp;#8217;s somewhat limited in that it only works when viewed from a small range of angles, but still, as the article points out, this can get obnoxious and distracting fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend could make advertising more dynamic and fun, giving us giant digital playspaces anytime we step outside. “When you literally have things popping out of a billboard at you, it feels inviting in all kinds of new ways,” said Greg Coleman, Prime Video’s global head of marketing and franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also turn our public commons into obtrusive brand exercises, making advertising literally something we can’t avoid. Anyone who has ever endured a too-popular meme knows it’s a short jump from virality to annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is exciting and it’s attention-getting,” said Arun Lakshmanan, an associate professor of marketing at the University at Buffalo School of Management and an expert in immersive advertising. “It also could really start getting intrusive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know about you, but I was already prepared to hang all the marketing professors. I&amp;#8217;m imagining driving down I94 to the twin cities, and now in addition to all the Jesus billboards and baby heartbeat billboards, I get to see &lt;a href="https://mspmag.com/arts-and-culture/kris-lindahl/"&gt;Kris Lindahl&lt;/a&gt; flapping his arms all over the place. Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s good to be the CIA, or rich</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/12/06/its-good-to-be-the-cia-or-rich/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">If you’re a sick, warped pedophile, that is.The news is not good this morning.</p>
<p>Did you know that if you work for the CIA, or are even a contractor doing work for the CIA, that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/cia-employees-sex-crimes-children-secret-files-foia">“the agency resists prosecution of its staff for fear the cases will reveal state secrets”</a>? So you can get away with all kinds of evil acts if you work there (which, I guess, shouldn’t be at all surprising, given that it is the CIA).</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past 14 years, the Central Intelligence Agency has secretly amassed credible evidence that at least 10 of its employees and contractors committed sexual crimes involving children.</p>
<p>Though most of these cases were referred to US attorneys for prosecution, only one of the individuals was ever charged with a crime. Prosecutors sent the rest of the cases back to the CIA to handle internally, meaning few faced any consequences beyond the possible loss of their jobs and security clearances. That marks a striking deviation from how sex crimes involving children have been handled at other federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Administration. CIA insiders say the agency resists prosecution of its staff for fear the cases will reveal state secrets.<img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/ciapedos-500x266.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="266" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-64778" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/ciapedos-500x266.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/ciapedos-150x80.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/ciapedos-300x159.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/ciapedos-768x408.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/ciapedos.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s all rather horrifying, especially given that these secret agencies have been blacklisting homosexuals for decades and acting aghast at the very idea of a gay person acquiring a sensitive position. They might be blackmailed, don’t you know. But pedophiles…just a slap on the wrist and a dismissal.</p>
<p>Speaking of pedophiles, there’s new news about dead child rapist Jeffrey Epstein. New records, flight logs, have been unearthed that reveal hundreds of additional flights we hadn’t known about. Epstein was just happily flitting about the globe for years, doing…what? I don’t know. Maybe the CIA does, but they’re not telling. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/faa-accidentally-released-jeffrey-epsteins-flight-records-2021-10">This jumped out at me</a>, though.</p>
<blockquote><p>Epstein owned a Gulfstream II (sold in November 2013), a Gulfstream IV (sold before his arrest), a Gulfstream GV-SP, and a Boeing 727 (nicknamed the “Lolita Express”) that notoriously ferried notable passengers and girls around the globe. According to flight manifests unsealed in a defamation case against Maxwell, travelers on Epstein’s planes included public figures from Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton to the supermodel Naomi Campbell and the astronaut John Glenn.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why? How? How does a guy without any kind of college degree, who started out as a math teacher at a private school (he wasn’t even very good at that), and then drifted into banking and finance, get such ridiculous sums of money that they can afford their very own 727?  What did he do to earn that kind of money?</p>
<p>Don’t ever try to tell me that the wealthy worked hard and deserve all that money.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Years ago, when we moved into our home, it was graced with magnificent trees. In the front yard, we had this huge weeping willow, one of the notable landmarks in our neighborhood, and a pair of tall pine trees; the centerpiece of the back yard was a grand old slippery elm. They’ve all succumbed to age, and we’ve had to pay experts to come in and chop them down as they became increasingly dangerous, losing limbs in storms and just generally falling into crepitude.</p>
<p>We have only one original tree left, right outside my office window. It’s a busy home to squirrels and birds. But it’s also doomed. Look at this hideous gnarled gap in the trunk.</p>
<p><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/heartwoodfungus-500x667.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="667" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-64775" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/heartwoodfungus-500x667.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/heartwoodfungus-113x150.jpg 113w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/heartwoodfungus-225x300.jpg 225w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/heartwoodfungus-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/heartwoodfungus.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></p>
<p>It’s a deep wound, and that’s a horrible pale fungus eating away at the heartwood. We’re probably going to have to butcher this tree, too.</p>
<p>We’ve had a fair number of saplings printed around the yard, but it’s doubtful that I’ll live long enough to enjoy their shade someday.</p>

<p class="lead"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/03/supreme-court-conservatives-lied/">Paul Waldman has suddenly figured out that the conservative justices <em><strong>lied</strong></em> in their confirmation hearings</a>. And now, just now,  it’s time to admit it.</p>
<blockquote><p>They lied.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m talking about the conservative justices on the Supreme Court, and the abortion rights those justices have now made clear they will eviscerate.</p>
<p>They weren’t just evasive, or vague, or deceptive. They lied. They lied to Congress and to the country, claiming they either had no opinions at all about abortion, or that their beliefs were simply irrelevant to how they would rule. They would be wise and pure, unsullied by crass policy preferences, offering impeccably objective readings of the Constitution.</p>
<p>It. Was. A. Lie.</p>
<p>We went through the same routine in the confirmation hearings of every one of those justices. When Democrats tried to get them to state plainly their views on Roe v. Wade, they took two approaches. Some tried to convince everyone that they would leave it untouched. Others, those already on record proclaiming opposition to abortion rights, suggested they had undergone a kind of intellectual factory reset enabling them to assess the question anew with an unspoiled mind, one concerned only with the law.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is astonishing that the media took this long to realize what was obvious to everyone. The Trumpkins knew it, and were giggling behind their palms about getting away with it. Everyone else knew it, too, but felt trapped by an unwarranted respect for norms and knowing that the media was in the bag and would ridicule the simple words, “they’re lying”. It was a real emperor’s new clothes kind of situation and everyone went along with it.</p>
<p>What’s also appalling is that those fuckers <em>knew</em> that had to lie. That opposing the established law of Roe v. Wade would instantly scuttle their nomination, that the electorate would rise up and make it impossible for many politicians to support their nomination. So they lied. They misled everyone until they could hide behind their Supreme Court tenure. Now they get to wreck civil rights in this country, their aim all along.</p>
<p>They were <em>ashamed</em> of their position. They knew it could only be whispered in the darkness until they got power, and then once they’d brought down that veil of darkness on the land, then and only then could they shout it out loud.</p>
<p>You know what else burns?</p>
<blockquote><p>But sometimes the right puts its purposes in the open. There was a particularly striking exchange between Laura Ingraham and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) on Fox News, where Ingraham grew inexplicably enraged over the mere possibility that Roe might not be overturned.</p>
<p>“If we have six Republican appointees on this court,” she said, “after all the money that’s been raised, the Federalist Society, all these big fat-cat dinners — I’m sorry, I’m pissed about this — if this court with six justices cannot do the right thing here,” then Republicans should “blow it up” and pass some kind of law limiting the court’s authority.</p>
<p>“I would do that in a heartbeat,” Cruz responded.</p>
<p>In other words: We bought this court, and we’d better get what we paid for.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep, we’re a third-rate banana republic where the law is for sale to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>“Endorsed by the Federalist Society” ought to be a huge black mark <em>against</em> any judicial nominee. Will our representatives see it that way? Don’t count on it.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was all a lie, a scam, a con: the assurances that they were blank slates committed to “originalism” and “textualism,” that they wouldn’t “legislate from the bench,” that they have no agenda but merely a “judicial philosophy.”</p>
<p>Somehow that philosophy nearly always produces results conservatives want: undermining voting rights, enhancing corporate power, constraining the rights of workers, enabling the proliferation of guns, and now most vividly, allowing state governments to force women to carry pregnancies to term against their will.</p>
<p>From this day forward, no one should be naive enough to believe a word any conservative says on this subject, except for those few who forthrightly proclaim that the Supreme Court must read right-wing policy preferences into the Constitution. There was never any mystery about who these justices are and what they would do. There were only liars saying otherwise, and fools who chose to believe them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fools run the media in America, then.</p>

    <title>High time for truth</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5889/high-time-for-truth#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The Parliament of the United Kingdom (Creative Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/British_Houses_of_Parliament.jpg" height="1093" alt="British_Houses_of_Parliament" width="1648" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone asked to identify the most serious political crisis in the United Kingdom today would be spoiled for choice. Candidates include the disruption of the supply chain, poverty set to worsen as the cost of living rises, astronomical waiting lists for hospital treatment, and increasing numbers of children who are falling behind in, or even falling out of, education. The predictable results of Brexit are starting to play out, with damage to fishing, farming and other industries, the threat of the return of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and the possible breakup of the United Kingdom. And there are the consequences of the mismanagement of the pandemic and uncertainty about its future evolution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most serious of all these serious problems is one that lies at the root of many of the others: it is a crisis in parliamentary democracy. At the heart of this crisis is an individual who happens to be the prime minister. Asserting that Boris Johnson is a liar is now regarded as a statement of the boringly obvious, like saying he has untidy hair. The Independent identified eight major lies in his October party conference speech. Presented with the truth &amp;ndash; as he was in an interview with Andrew Marr, who challenged his claims over wage increases &amp;ndash; he simply reiterates his lies with a trademark smirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one place where it is unsafe to say this &amp;ndash; the place where lying matters most, namely, the Houses of Parliament. When, last summer, Labour MP Dawn Butler highlighted the danger presented by Johnson&amp;rsquo;s mendacity, especially in a pandemic, she was asked to leave the House. In an article subsequently written with the ex-Speaker of the Commons John Bercow, she argued that the rule barring MPs from calling each other liars was &amp;ldquo;the product of a bygone age&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frightening fact is that that age is not so bygone. As recently as 2018, Esther McVey, then Work and Pensions Secretary, made an incorrect statement about Universal Credit. This was challenged by the National Audit Office. She was obliged to return to parliament to correct her statement and apologise for misleading the house. By contrast, Johnson&amp;rsquo;s eye-popping lie that there would be no paperwork associated with a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK has passed without official rebuke, though the border and the associated paperwork have proven to be hugely disruptive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The rot in the United Kingdom's body politic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In August, a petition to introduce legislation to make lying in parliament a criminal offence secured more than a 100,000 signatures. Having passed this threshold, the petition, backed by campaigner and lawyer Peter Stefanovic, is now being considered for debate in the Commons. Such a debate may prove unlikely, given the government&amp;rsquo;s response that &amp;ldquo;conduct in the Chamber is a matter for the Speaker&amp;rdquo;. But while debating the issue would surely cause embarrassment to the prime minister and his government, avoiding it altogether should also be a point of shame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body politic is rotting. The prime minister is of course not a solitary actor: he is supported by colleagues whose incompetence may be welcome as it makes his own less visible, as well as by the adoring rank-and-file members of his party. But so long as Johnson can lie with impunity, and continue doing so even when his lies have been called out &amp;ndash; and so long as it is Johnson himself who is responsible for the enforcement of the ministerial code that regulates the behaviour of politicians &amp;ndash; the rot will continue to spread from the top down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind this threat is an assault on the very idea of truth. Among the most iniquitous enemies of truth are those academics who quote Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s assertion that &amp;ldquo;there are no facts, only interpretations&amp;rdquo;. Such relativism is, of course, set aside when their interests are at stake and they check their pay slips. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the standing of the UK as a moral force in a world facing an uncertain future is diminishing. What will COP26 delegates think as they are addressed by a man described as &amp;ldquo;the most accomplished liar in public life&amp;rdquo; by a leading figure in his own party &amp;ndash; Rory Stewart, a junior minister in the Foreign Office when Johnson was foreign secretary? Of great concern is that a distrustful electorate with a dangerous indifference that says &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know who to believe; they are all the same&amp;rdquo; may ease the passage from democracy to kleptocracy and tyranny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have yet to see whether the petition to criminalise lying in the Commons will be granted its debate. If such legislation were to pass, it would leave Johnson and others like him with little to say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A still from &amp;ldquo;The Lost Daughter&amp;rdquo;, starring Dakota Johnson (right) and Olivia Colman (left) (YANNIS DRAKOULIDIS/NETFLIX &amp;copy; 2021)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/TheLostDaughter_81478910_Instreams_168_R.jpg" height="989" alt="TheLostDaughter_81478910_Instreams_168_R" width="1648" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elena Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Neapolitan Quartet&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; an epic tale of female friendship and rivalry told over six decades &amp;ndash; is easily her most famous work. By the time the final volume had been published in English in 2015, the quartet had become an international bestseller, sparking what we now know as &amp;ldquo;Ferrante Fever&amp;rdquo;. However, it was her first three novels, Ferrante has suggested, that allowed her the &amp;ldquo;creative space&amp;rdquo; to write the quartet. She sees them as &amp;ldquo;part of a chain&amp;rdquo; that deal with similar themes and concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This should give Ferrante fans, as well as those discovering her work, more reason to watch &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter,&lt;/em&gt; a film version of the last of those formative three novels, due for release in January. Adapted and directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, the film features a star-studded female cast, including Jessie Buckley, Olivia Colman and Dakota Johnson. Ferrante has taken a hands-off approach to the adaptation, in keeping with the fact that she has famously kept her true identity hidden. In a letter to her publisher in 2016, affirming this stance, she wrote: &amp;ldquo;I believe that books, once they are written, have no need of their authors. If they have something to say, they will sooner or later find readers; if not, they won&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, she did make one crucial intervention. When Gyllenhaal, a seasoned actor, wrote to Ferrante asking for permission to adapt &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, the author agreed, but on one intriguing condition: Gyllenhaal had to direct it herself or the contract was &amp;ldquo;null and void&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mothers, daughters and dolls&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mothers and daughters are a recurrent theme in Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s work and none more so than &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt; (originally published in 2006 as &lt;em&gt;La figlia oscura&lt;/em&gt;), a book about a woman who abandons her children. In Gyllenhaal&amp;rsquo;s compelling adaptation, the protagonist, Leda Caruso (Colman), a professor of literature and a specialist in Italian translation, is on holiday alone on a Greek island. Leda is divorced; her grown-up daughters live with their father. On the beach she encounters a large, loud and uncouth American family. Leda becomes fascinated with one family member, Nina (Johnson), a beautiful young woman, and her daughter Elena (Athena Martin).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book and film follow similar trajectories. Leda envies Nina&amp;rsquo;s close relationship with her daughter and her apparent maternal serenity. The child reflects her mother&amp;rsquo;s love in her attachment to her doll, named Nani, &amp;ldquo;from whom the child was never parted and to whom Nina paid attention as if she were alive, a second daughter&amp;rdquo;. But then Elena goes missing on the beach and there is uproar. Leda recalls her own panic when one of her own daughters was lost, but reassures Nina, &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s wearing your hat&amp;hellip; She&amp;rsquo;ll be found, we&amp;rsquo;ll see her easily.&amp;rdquo; Leda is applauded when she finds the girl. However, as we soon discover, she has stolen Elena&amp;rsquo;s abandoned doll: a senseless, some would say cruel, act that even Leda doesn&amp;rsquo;t truly comprehend. As she comments at the beginning of the novel: &amp;ldquo;The hardest things to talk about are the ones we ourselves can&amp;rsquo;t understand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the book, Gyllenhaal commented at the New Yorker Festival in 2018: &amp;ldquo;I have never heard these things articulated before. There was one point where I was like, this woman is so fucked up, and then I was like, I totally relate to her.&amp;rdquo; In an interview with the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2014, Ferrante refers to it as &amp;ldquo;the most daring, the most risk-taking&amp;rdquo; of all her early novels, with themes that troubled her the most, claiming: &amp;ldquo;If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone through that, with great anxiety, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have written &lt;em&gt;My Brilliant Friend&lt;/em&gt; [the first volume of her Neapolitan quartet].&amp;rdquo; A year later, she told the Flemish paper &lt;em&gt;De Standaard&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;It cost me a lot to write&amp;hellip; [and] left me feeling the way you do when you swim until you&amp;rsquo;re exhausted and then you realise you&amp;rsquo;ve gone too far from the shore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s first two novels as part of a chain leading to the third. In her debut, &lt;em&gt;L&amp;rsquo;amore molesto&lt;/em&gt; (1992), translated into English as &lt;em&gt;Troubling Love&lt;/em&gt; in 2006, Delia is obsessed with her mother Amalia&amp;rsquo;s beauty. After learning that she has drowned, Delia travels home to Naples for the funeral and attempts to piece together the details surrounding her mysterious death. In doing so she is forced to confront her own troubling childhood memories. In &lt;em&gt;I giorni dell&amp;rsquo;abbandono&lt;/em&gt; (2002), translated as &lt;em&gt;Days of Abandonment &lt;/em&gt;in 2005 and made into a film the same year by Roberto Faenza, Olga has a breakdown after her husband leaves her for a younger woman. She neglects her children, but her young daughter&amp;rsquo;s presence helps bring her back from the brink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt; also points to the quartet to come. For Leda, it is a lost doll that precipitates her emotional crisis. A similar motif occurs in &lt;em&gt;My Brilliant Friend&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; at the start of the novel, childhood friends Lila and Len&amp;ugrave; throw each other&amp;rsquo;s dolls into the cellar of an apartment owned by Don Achille Carracci, &amp;ldquo;the ogre of fairy tales&amp;rdquo;. Ferrante went on to write a children&amp;rsquo;s novel, &lt;em&gt;La spiaggia di notte&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Beach at Night&lt;/em&gt;), narrated by the doll from &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ferrante's 'fragmenting' characters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much of the drama in the book and film comes from the question of whether Leda will keep the doll or give it back. The child, Elena, is distraught by the loss, but instead of returning the doll, Leda buys it new clothes from the local toy shop. Her transgression provokes recollections of her own childhood doll, Mina, that she had given to her eldest daughter. This leads to a deluge of memories where we learn Leda abandoned her children so she could pursue academic success and a passionate love affair with the charismatic Professor Hardy (Peter Sarsgaard). In the novel, Leda recalls all her bad mothering moments &amp;ndash; when she had shouted at her children, slammed a door shut on one of them, or thrown the doll out of the window. Gyllenhaal is kinder and shows young Leda (Buckley) in a series of flashbacks as a loving mother, genuinely torn between her work and her children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a 2007 interview with the Italian press, Ferrante claims that Leda &amp;ldquo;sought an emancipation and confrontation on equal terms with the male world&amp;rdquo;. She had wanted both children and a career. Gyllenhaal&amp;rsquo;s adaptation explores this decision with understanding and grace. Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s novel is darker &amp;ndash; accenting a mean, selfish streak in Leda followed by a crushing guilt that haunts her. One can convey a character&amp;rsquo;s emotional scars, their hidden thoughts, what Ferrante has called their &amp;ldquo;fragmentation&amp;rdquo;, more easily in a novel than a film. Perhaps inevitably, then, both Gyllenhaal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt; and Faenza&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Days of Abandonment&lt;/em&gt; soften the darkness at the heart of the novels, along with the obsessive nature and intensity of the female protagonists, making the characters more sympathetic for a film audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The apparent ease with which Gyllenhaal has adapted the novel for a mainstream audience is an indication of the authenticity of Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s text &amp;ndash; something she always strives for. One of the reasons her fiction translates so well onto screen is because she shows, rather than tells, difficult emotions. Part of the pleasure of &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, in both forms, is the honesty with which the female protagonist is drawn and, in the film, the beauty with which Colman conveys it: a nuanced portrait of a middle-aged woman &amp;ndash; flawed, prickly, sympathetic. As Ferrante observed in a &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; interview in 2015: &amp;ldquo;Honest writing forces itself to find words for those parts of our experience that are hidden and silent.&amp;rdquo; It is this ability to express the complexity of women&amp;rsquo;s feelings &amp;ndash; as children, mothers and friends &amp;ndash; how they function in a patriarchal society and cope with obstacles including isolation and abandonment, that gives Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s work its enduring appeal. Gyllenhaal&amp;rsquo;s film is a bold, textured exploration of motherhood with a refreshing lack of sentimentality that will undoubtedly win Ferrante new fans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021.

    <title>Cancer beater?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Artist's rendering of a cancerous cell (Creative Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Cell-Cancer-Cell-Division-Human-Meiosis-Mitosis-3876669.jpg" height="540" alt="Cell-Cancer-Cell-Division-Human-Meiosis-Mitosis-3876669" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Population screening programmes are a key part of our public health arsenal, saving an estimated 10,000 lives in England each year. But it is an unusual form of healthcare in that otherwise healthy individuals are contacted before symptoms arise. Additionally, despite their potential to prevent disease, such programmes, if not properly designed, can harm as well as help the population. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the key challenges with developing new programmes is around test specificity: how likely it is that a person will be told they have a disease if they don&amp;rsquo;t actually have it (a &amp;ldquo;false positive&amp;rdquo;). High rates of false positives can lead to costly, invasive follow-ups, and significant anxiety for individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will be key considerations for UK regulators in their upcoming evaluation of the Galleri Test, a potentially revolutionary new blood test for the early identification of cancer. Preliminary studies suggest it is able to detect more than 50 different types of cancer before symptoms appear, and locate with 90 per cent accuracy the tissue in which the tumour originated. Crucially, the test is quick, easy and non-invasive, and the false positive rate appears to be comparatively low. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test works by looking for tiny bits of DNA that have broken off tumour cells and float around in the bloodstream (&amp;ldquo;cell-free DNA&amp;rdquo;). It is currently available in the US for those at high risk. However, its power as a screening tool &amp;ndash; identifying early cancer in symptomless individuals not at high risk, who therefore have the best chance of successful treatment &amp;ndash; has not yet been assessed. Since September, Galleri has been rolled out in a large NHS clinical trial involving 140,000 healthy volunteers. The trial is the biggest of its kind, with results expected in 2023. If successful, it has the potential to expand to a million more volunteers from 2024. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have questioned whether the test will deliver on the hype when used in a real-world setting, with scientists all too aware of past disappointments. Hope that it is the holy grail of cancer screening should be tempered; its success remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Employees operate the telephones at the Touch Solutions Ltd call centre. (ILO/Benoit Marquet/Creative Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-_33_.jpg" height="912" alt="Screenshot-_33_" width="1388" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the many offensive &amp;ldquo;-isms&amp;rdquo; we see and hear about every day, &amp;ldquo;accentism&amp;rdquo; rarely gets a mention. After all, for many of us, different accents are part and parcel of daily interaction. Yet research has shown that unconscious bias is prompted by accents in much the same way that it is by sex or skin colour. People who sound different are assigned certain cultural traits or grouped into particular social classes, which together provide fuel for prejudices. When it comes to our perceptions of the speaker, this impacts on our most fickle of human feelings: trust and confidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what might happen if technology was developed that enabled people in all corners of the globe to sound more or less similar? Sanas, a Silicon Valley-based start-up that bills itself as &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rsquo;s first solution for real-time accent matching&amp;rdquo;, has taken steps towards this. With its technology, a person in the Philippines speaking over the phone to someone in the US will sound American; or to someone in Spain, Spanish &amp;ndash; whatever accent it is that the company&amp;rsquo;s AI-powered programme &amp;ldquo;hears&amp;rdquo; at the other end of the line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Started by people of Russian, Chinese and Spanish-speaking backgrounds, Sanas explains on its website that the concept came about via the difficulties its founders experienced in understanding one another. It is now being tested in call centres, and perhaps for good reason: a frustrated caller seeking expert help with a faulty product is likely to be frustrated even further if they can&amp;rsquo;t understand the instructions being given over the phone. Sanas wants to help everyone to &amp;ldquo;understand and be understood&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But while the technology will no doubt make communication between a call centre worker and an angry customer less fraught, does it risk fuelling a homogenisation of accents, if not worse &amp;ndash; the feeding of a sense that &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; accents are to be trusted more? A number of the largest UK and US companies have outsourced their call centres to India, the Philippines and other countries where labour is abundant and cheap. Those call centres are serving millions of customers in Europe and North America for whom ease and convenience, rather than cultural exchange and learning, are the highest priorities. But the distinctiveness of the accents of staff &amp;ndash; the intonations and the musicality; the histories that lie behind their dialects &amp;ndash; will be gone if such technology is widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cross-cultural communication brings many benefits. But it would be no bad thing to remember that in the process of making communication between different peoples of the world easier, much can be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

But, asks &lt;strong&gt;Julian Baggini&lt;/strong&gt;, does that mean we should now stop killing other creatures?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our human difference gives us reasons not to kill each other that go beyond simplistic injunctions to never kill or never shorten life at all. Unlike other animals, we do not live just in the present. Our memories, plans and projects matter to us in ways that are inconceivable for any other creature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The curious mind of a dog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; with our pets all the time. But as &lt;strong&gt;Cal Flyn&lt;/strong&gt; discovers, techniques are being developed that allow dogs to seemingly understand vocabulary and grammar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;We may never know if the dogs are using and comprehending human language to mean exactly the same as we do.

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

    <title>*Out of Office Response* Re: quick question?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/19/office-response-re-quick-question/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let’s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook’s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>
