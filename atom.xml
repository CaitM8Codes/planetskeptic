Right now, I have no clue when it will be Easter this year, and you don’t need to tell me, because I don’t care and I don’t celebrate it.</p>
<p>So in the same spirit of random decisions, but with at least a little more simple predictability, I hereby declare that the first Sunday after Darwin’s birthday is Octo-Easter. Here are some Octo-Easter eggs for you all.</p>

<p>I suppose we could claim we’re celebrating the fecundity of the sea, or just the deep dark cold depths, or whatever. Don’t care. You can also celebrate it or don’t. That’s the nice thing about these freethought holidays, you’re free to think whatever you want about them.</p>

<p class="lead">Rotten kids. They haven’t been rejuvenating me. That’s the message I get from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/11/grandparents-looking-after-grandchildren-has-no-health-advantages-study-suggests">one silly study</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Grandparents planning hefty amounts of childcare this half-term might want to think again after research claimed to disprove previous findings of a “rejuvenating effect” from looking after grandchildren.</p>
<p>Many studies have appeared to show mental and physical health advantages for those who care for their grandchildren. But none involved researchers talking to the same grandparents before and after their caregiving responsibilities began.</p>
<p>When the authors of Is There a Rejuvenating Effect of (Grand)Childcare? A Longitudinal Study, published this week in The Journals of Gerontology, did that, they found that caring for grandchildren failed to make grandparents feel any younger than their actual age.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry, Iliana and Knut, you know I only visited you to leech youth-giving properties from you, like a vampire or Peter Thiel. Now I know it was all a sham, so I can stay home in the future.</p>
<p>The one interesting thing from the work is that it exposed selection bias in previous studies. Those studies compared how subjectively younger grandparents who took care of grandchildren felt, compared to those who didn’t. Aside from just the subjective evaluation of the effects, wouldn’t there be obvious bias in that you had to feel fairly healthy and vigorous to volunteer for child care in the first place? That’s hard work, yo. When they compared the same individuals before and after, the Fountain of Youth effect disappeared.</p>
<p>Surprise. I don’t even understand why this was considered a valid hypothesis in the first place, but then I’m not at all familiar with that literature.</p>
<p>You know, in all the times we’ve made the long trip to visit the grandkids, and all the times my wife has had extended stays to help with childcare, we’ve never once contemplated the peculiar notion that it might shave a few years of senescence off of us. Every trip back home we’re mainly dealing with tiredness, because the little ragamuffins can run us ragged.</p>
<p>We go because it makes us happy. Isn’t that enough?</p>

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;See that trivial little cable to the right? That&amp;#8217;s Apple&amp;#8217;s proprietary iPhone charging cable, and that&amp;#8217;s the widget that&amp;#8217;s going to drive me right out of the Apple ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already pay a premium for Apple products, which is kind of OK because they are very good, reliable devices. On top of that, though, Apple also wants to lock us into &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; cables &amp;#8212; power cables, peripheral cables, you name it &amp;#8212; and our devices can detect whether the cable we use to plug in our phones is an Official Approved Apple&amp;trade; cable, and if they aren&amp;#8217;t, they&amp;#8217;ll refuse to connect. And sometimes, when you most need it, your phone will decide that the cable you are using is no longer up to its standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I are now down to ONE (1) functioning cable between us. I had to take it away because I need my phone to connect to any university services (that&amp;#8217;s another gripe I&amp;#8217;ll put off to another day), and I can&amp;#8217;t trust it not to fail on me. I have bought so god-damn many phone cables because I&amp;#8217;ve got maybe an 80% success rate in seeing a new cable work at all. All I could do is throw a fistful of unlikely cables at my wife as I was going out to work and suggest she try them and see if one magically works now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new requirement for my next phone is that it have a basic USB-C charging connector. Goodbye Apple, hello Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All aboard the pandemic roller-coaster!</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">I already told you <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/02/09/every-time-jesus-this-pandemic-will-never-end/">my university is removing the vaccine mandate for attendance at large public events</a>, and now the <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-and-st-paul-lift-vaccine-or-test-mandate-for-restaurants-bars/600145228/">major cities are removing them</a>, too.</p>
<blockquote><p>Twin Cities Mayors Melvin Carter and Jacob Frey on Thursday jointly rescinded their vaccine-or-test emergency regulations for restaurants, bars and entertainment venues, effective immediately, as COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations rapidly decline.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. This is bonkers. Yes, the numbers are going down, we’re past the peak, but look at the difference in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#daily">case rate between vaccinated and unvaccinated</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/caserate.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/caserate-500x313.png" alt="" width="500" height="313" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65587" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/caserate-500x313.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/caserate-150x94.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/caserate-300x188.png 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/caserate.png 721w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a></p>
<p>So we’re going to reduce the incentives for the unvaccinated to get vaccinated. These chickenshit politicians are calling it “invasive regulation”, when it’s a mundane public health measure, in the same way that we expect children to be vaccinated before they go off to school. It makes no sense. It’s pandering to Republicans.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s something more nefarious. The Democrats see a way to reduce the number of Republican voters permanently. Hey, Mr MAGA Hat, please do cough and sneeze all over your friends at a rally, and while you’re at it, go play in traffic. We won’t get you all, but if we cripple you financially by throwing you on the mercies of your preferred health care system, or invalid you out with long COVID, we’ll be hampering your future effectiveness as a political force. &lt;cackles evilly&gt;</p>
<p>No, not really, I don’t endorse that. You’re already enough of a drag on society, and I don’t want to encourage a reservoir for new mutations to fester.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as we wait for the next surge, here are some recommendations for you sensible people.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/maskrecommendations.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/maskrecommendations-500x500.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65588" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/maskrecommendations-500x500.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/maskrecommendations-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/maskrecommendations-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/maskrecommendations.jpeg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></a></p>
<p>I’m using N94 &amp; N95 masks entirely now. It’s kind of a shame, because last year there was a little cottage industry of artists making lovely cloth masks, but those are no longer recommended, unless worn as part of a set of layers. Things better not get so bad that I need a PAPR to go grocery shopping!</p>
<p>I also don’t understand the resistance to wearing masks. It’s -12°C and snowing with 55 km/hr winds here — even without a pandemic I’d be wearing a mask.</p>

    <title>Tree-planting schemes could slow climate change. But dangers lurk</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5920/tree-planting-schemes-could-slow-climate-change-but-dangers-lurk#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="New tree planting in the UK (geograph.org.uk)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/1New_tree_planting_-_geograph.org.uk_-_625802.jpg" height="480" alt="New tree planting UK" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unveiling in January of a government scheme to turn swathes of farmland across Britain into sustainable habitat for wildlife was greeted with cheers among campaigners. The justification for part of the scheme &amp;ndash; the planting of trees &amp;ndash; is backed by growing evidence of the cooling effects of afforestation. Research conducted at ETH Zurich, reported in November last year, found that areas of some European cities with high tree cover were as much as 12 degrees cooler than those without.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The government&amp;rsquo;s Local Nature Recovery scheme sounds like a win-win: habitats are restored, land surfaces cool, and farmers are financially rewarded for their efforts. But not all are in agreement. The National Farmers Union in Wales has responded to the scheme with alarm. Already, farms in Wales are being sold to private equity firms who, taking advantage of forestry grants, have bought up land in order to plant trees. Farmers there have warned that any afforestation might do more harm than good if it&amp;rsquo;s not properly thought through, especially if conifers &amp;ndash; known to be damaging to soil fertility &amp;ndash; are planted en masse by companies with little understanding of local ecology.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The government has sought to allay another concern. The various projects involved in the scheme won&amp;rsquo;t go ahead, it has said, unless there is certainty that food production won&amp;rsquo;t be affected. Any change in the use of agricultural land inevitably risks affecting the productivity of that land. This concern has global echoes. Oxfam warned last year that if too much afforestation or reforestation takes place over the coming three decades, resultant food price rises will worsen hunger. Globally, the organisation estimated, 350 million hectares of land could be forested without causing any significant disruption to food prices. This was the target set in the so-called Bonn Challenge in 2011. But if tree planting were to be the only strategy used for reaching net zero, five times that surface area, equivalent to all the farmland on the planet, would be required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The risks don&amp;rsquo;t stop there. If tree planting schemes essentially replicate monoculture practices, the UK&amp;rsquo;s already alarming rates of biodiversity loss &amp;ndash; it now ranks among the least biodiverse countries in the world &amp;ndash; could quicken. In 2020 it was reported that 80 percent of commitments made in the Bonn Challenge, which some 40 countries have so far signed up to, were for either monoculture plantations or a limited variety of trees. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Promises to ramp up tree-planting were made by several parties in the last UK elections, indicating that this low-cost &amp;ndash; and potentially highly effective &amp;ndash; strategy for reaching net zero had broad support. In the US, even Donald Trump backed the Trillion Trees Campaign while in office. But although it might appear an attractive route to tackling the climate crisis, it&amp;rsquo;s clear there are justifiable fears. In more than a figurative sense then, let&amp;rsquo;s not miss the wood for the trees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist spring 2022. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The logical mystic</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5893/the-logical-mystic#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Ludwig Wittgenstein&amp;rsquo;s wooden cabin in Skjolden, Norway (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Witt.jpg" height="691" alt="Witt" width="1097" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One hundred years ago, a slim volume of philosophy was published by the then unknown Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. The book was as curious as its title, &lt;em&gt;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&lt;/em&gt;. Running to only 75 pages, it was in the form of a series of propositions, the gnomic quality of the first as baffling to the newcomer today as it was then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. The world is all that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;1.1 The world is a totality of facts not of things.&lt;br /&gt;1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.&lt;br /&gt;1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so on, through six propositions, 526 numbered statements, equally emphatic and enigmatic, until the seventh and final proposition, which stands alone at the end of the text: &amp;ldquo;Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must remain silent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s influence was to be dramatic and far-reaching. Wittgenstein believed he had found a &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; to how language and the world relate, that they shared a logical form. This also set a limit as to what questions could be meaningfully asked. Any question which could not be verified was, in philosophical terms, nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in the First World War trenches, &lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt; is, in many ways, a work of mysticism. A believer, Wittgenstein regarded part of the task of philosophy as sorting what was sayable from what was unsayable, a demarcation which left God, religion and ethics outside the realm of philosophical thinking. &amp;ldquo;Perhaps,&amp;rdquo; he wrote in a letter home from the front, &amp;ldquo;the nearness of death will bring light into life. God enlighten me.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt; is the fruit of this engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nietzsche wrote that &amp;ldquo;During times of peace the warlike man makes war upon himself&amp;rdquo; but for many thinkers there has been no need to turn inwards. The 20th century, with its two world wars, produced a wealth of philosophers who wrote their work in extremis &amp;ndash; French philosopher Jean Cavailles produced his great work, &lt;em&gt;On Logic and the Theory of Science&lt;/em&gt;, as a prisoner of war; Louis Althusser first engaged with Marx during five years interred in Schleswig-Holstein, while Simone Weil fought as part of the Durutti Column in the Spanish Civil War, which coincided with her despair at politics and her shift towards religious thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wittgenstein was 25 years old at the start of the First World War. The son of one of Vienna&amp;rsquo;s richest industrialist families, he studied aeronautical engineering before turning to theoretical mathematics after reading Bertrand Russell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Principles of Mathematics&lt;/em&gt; and Gottlob Frege&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Foundations of Arithmetic&lt;/em&gt;. The questions they raised about logic and mathematics left him, he later said, in &amp;ldquo;a constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to study under Frege, in 1911 he arrived unannounced at Russell&amp;rsquo;s study in Cambridge, soon dominating his lectures on propositional logic. It was the start of an exhausting, difficult relationship between the two &amp;ndash; Russell loved him as &amp;ldquo;the young man one hopes for&amp;rdquo;, yet described him as an &amp;ldquo;infliction&amp;rdquo;. Wittgenstein credited Russell with saving his life after nine years of loneliness, but his criticism of Russell&amp;rsquo;s work was such that the older philosopher was forced to recognise he could &amp;ldquo;not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ambivalence in their relationship was not unique. Wittgenstein was notoriously solipsistic in his &amp;ldquo;friendships&amp;rdquo; and particularly harsh on those he regarded as intellectually inferior, which soon included Russell and later most other philosophers, with the exception of Frank Ramsey, who first translated&lt;em&gt; Tractatus&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it also often included himself. Tormented by problems of logic, he would feel total disgust with himself when unable to solve them. This self-loathing had a spiritual component: as he put it to Russell, he agonised about two things, logic and his sins, cursed as he was by &amp;ldquo;half talent&amp;rdquo;. Making war on himself had left him suicidal. What he needed was a war outside himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Philosophy in a time of war&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In August 1914 it arrived. Wittgenstein enlisted and was assigned to an artillery regiment in Krakow on the Eastern Front, part of what his biographer Ray Monk terms &amp;ldquo;one of the most absurdly incompetent campaigns of the early months of the war&amp;rdquo;. Both sides were stationed in the wrong place, which for Wittgenstein meant several months on a ship in the Vistula river awaiting something, anything, to happen. Not only was he isolated; those he was closest to, including his lover David Pinset, were now on the enemy side. As ever, his thoughts turned to suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as ever, he was stopped. This time, it was by a book. Browsing in a bookshop in Galicia, he chanced upon a copy of Tolstoy&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Gospel in Brief&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; the Russian writer&amp;rsquo;s retelling of the life of Christ by merging the four Gospels. The book would have a profound influence on Wittgenstein. With it virtually memorised, he would &amp;ldquo;recite Tolstoy&amp;rsquo;s words over and over again in my head&amp;rdquo; while under fire. It produced in Wittgenstein, Monk writes, &amp;ldquo;exactly the kind of personal transformation, the religious conversion, he had gone to war to find&amp;rdquo;. The book, Wittgenstein later wrote, &amp;ldquo;kept me alive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also informed, dramatically, &lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt;. What was a work on logical symbolism became something much deeper, much wider, much stranger. Nothing in the existence of the mystical contradicted his theories of the logical. In occupying different realms, they shared none of the criteria of validity. They were, he argued, separate. His job was to show in any situation which was which, and ensure that the separation was absolutely enforced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt; introduces what has become known as the &amp;ldquo;picture theory of language&amp;rdquo;. For Wittgenstein there was a basic coherence between the structure of language and the structure of the world. This correspondence &amp;ndash; between, for instance, the sentence &amp;ldquo;the cat sat on the mat&amp;rdquo; and the state of affairs that inspires it (a cat sitting on a mat) &amp;ndash; is what enables language to represent reality. He uses the example of a gramophone record and a musical score. While each has a different materiality, they share a logical form: given the record one could deduce the score, and given the score, one could deduce the recording. Thus the relationship between language and reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt; opens with &amp;ldquo;The world is all that is the case&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The world is a totality of facts, not of things.&amp;rdquo; That is, the &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; is a totality of that of which we can speak, make propositions about, define. And it is &amp;ldquo;all the facts&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; nothing is &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; which cannot be captured factually, which cannot be described.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One instance of a &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; that cannot be described is how language does, in fact, represent the world. Here Wittgenstein points to a camera: the camera can picture the world, but it cannot picture the mechanisms which allow it to do so. It cannot represent its own method of representation. &amp;ldquo;Propositions can represent the whole of reality, but they cannot represent what they must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it: logical form.&amp;rdquo; Philosophy has no place here. One cannot have a logic of logic; a meta-language is a language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Wittgenstein writes, philosophy &amp;ldquo;should limit the thinkable and thereby the unthinkable. It should limit the unthinkable from within through the thinkable. It will mean the unspeakable by clearly displaying the speakable. Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly; indeed everything that can be said can be said clearly.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What cannot be captured in propositions &amp;ndash; what cannot be said clearly &amp;ndash; is therefore either senseless, in that it does not offer a picture of possible facts, or nonsense, where &amp;ldquo;nonsense&amp;rdquo; is that which cannot be described without the description being absurd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Logical positivism and the Vienna Circle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was this idea which influenced the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle, whose &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo; was, like Wittgenstein, to demarcate between what is sense and nonsense, particularly with philosophy. The great unanswerable questions &amp;ndash; about God, freedom, substance, causality &amp;ndash; are unanswerable because they are not genuine questions. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one should ignore, or point out that to speak of it leads only to nonsense. A sentence such as &amp;ldquo;It is raining&amp;rdquo; is verifiable, whereas &amp;ldquo;God is good&amp;rdquo; is not, and is therefore meaningless &amp;ndash; a pseudostatement. One may feel it is true, but one cannot do any more than that. For the logical positivists this was held to be the case for most metaphysical questions, as well as aesthetics and ethics. The job of philosophy is to seek out this nonsense and strip it away from questions of meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Wittgenstein differs absolutely from the logical positivists is precisely at this idea of nonsense. While agreeing that the unanswerable questions are not genuine philosophical questions at all &amp;ndash; he himself sometimes described his philosophy as &amp;ldquo;therapeutic&amp;rdquo; in that it stopped one philosophising &amp;ndash; this did not mean they could be dismissed. Simply, the truly religious was outside of speech. It could only be &amp;ldquo;shown&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and, as he puts it in &lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;what can be shown cannot be said.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To call a religious belief or practice &amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo; is, to use a basic philosophical term, to commit a category error. Truth and falseness belong to the sorts of &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; which make up the world, the meaningful propositions of language. Religious belief &amp;ndash; the mystical &amp;ndash; is not a fact of this sort, and therefore to submit it to the truth tests of propositional logic is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wittgenstein here distinguishes between an explanation and an expression. Propositions are explanations, and can be true or false. But an expression, such as a religious belief, cannot. Take the example of pain. I can display pain by moaning or by saying &amp;ldquo;Ouch&amp;rdquo;. Or I can use the sentence &amp;ldquo;I am in pain.&amp;rdquo; The latter shares a grammatical structure with such phrases as &amp;ldquo;It is raining&amp;rdquo;, but it is in fact an expression in exactly the same way that &amp;ldquo;Ouch&amp;rdquo; is an expression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, &amp;ldquo;I am in pain&amp;rdquo; is simply a substitute for &amp;ldquo;Ouch&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; it is a replacement, not a description, and it would be absurd for someone to say to me it is false. &amp;ldquo;There are indeed things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical,&amp;rdquo; he wrote. We are in a space, outside of logic, we are where &amp;ldquo;language goes on holiday&amp;rdquo;. Thus &amp;ldquo;To be able to think outside the limit of thought &amp;ndash; to be able to comprehend the mystical &amp;ndash; would require that we think what cannot be thought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Religious belief shares this form: it manifests itself. It cannot be spoken of; rather, it must be shown. To believe in the resurrection is to have a rule to follow, to act as one should when one believes in the resurrection. As Wittgenstein would later argue, to understand a rule is to know what would count as acting in accord with it. A religious belief that does not affect the behaviour of the believer is not a religious belief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor is it meaningless. Wittgenstein&amp;rsquo;s June 1915 Notebook breaks off from speculations about logic. He writes: &amp;ldquo;I know that this world exists&amp;hellip; something about it is problematic, which we call its meaning&amp;hellip; this meaning does not lie in it but outside it&amp;hellip; the meaning of life, i.e., the meaning of the world, we can call God.&amp;rdquo; It is one&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;duty to oneself&amp;rdquo; to act on this belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for religious belief, so for ethics. &amp;ldquo;A certain characteristic misuse of our language runs throughout all ethical and religious expressions,&amp;rdquo; he would say in the only lecture he ever gave outside of his official teaching duties, his 1929 &amp;ldquo;Lecture on Ethics&amp;rdquo;. An ethical position is not that which can be said; rather, again it is that which can be shown. As he puts it in &lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;it is impossible for there to be propositions of ethics. Propositions can express nothing that is higher.&amp;rdquo; Or, as he wrote in his war diary, &amp;ldquo;I am either happy or unhappy, that is all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wittgenstein&amp;rsquo;s religious turn&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late 1918, Bertrand Russell produced his &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. In a footnote about tautologies, he wrote: &amp;ldquo;The importance of &amp;lsquo;tautology&amp;rsquo; for a definition of mathematics was pointed out to me by my former pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein, who was working on the problem. I do not know whether he has solved it, or even whether he is alive or dead.&amp;rdquo; He had not heard from his &amp;ldquo;former pupil&amp;rdquo; since 1915. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wittgenstein had been at the front for most of that time. There, he often placed himself in the most dangerous positions, directly in the line of fire from Allied troops, an action which saw him decorated a number of times. In November 1918 he was captured by Allied forces and spent nine months as a prisoner of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the while he continued to read Tolstoy, keep his Notebooks and work on the &lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt;, which was finally published in 1921 while Wittgenstein was working as a primary school teacher in rural Austria. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He and Russell had resumed contact, and the latter provided the introduction to the German edition of the &lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt; so as to lend weight to the work of this still unknown philosopher. Unlike Wittgenstein, Russell had not fought in the war, spending the duration in prison as a conscientious objector, an act of its own categorical bravery. Nor, emphatically, did he believe in God. Of Wittgenstein&amp;rsquo;s religious turn he would write: &amp;ldquo;He has penetrated deep into mystical ways of thought and feeling, but I think (though he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t agree) that what he likes best in mysticism is its power to make him stop thinking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not until 1929 that Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge, the intervening years spent madly oscillating between &amp;ldquo;stopping thinking&amp;rdquo; and thinking too much. He had, after the sort of long battle which only occurs in academia, been presented with his doctorate on the basis of &lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his &amp;ldquo;Lecture on Ethics&amp;rdquo;, Wittgenstein described experiences which have an absolute value rather than an instrumental one. The first is being &amp;ldquo;safe in the hands of God&amp;rdquo;; the second is &amp;ldquo;seeing the world as a miracle&amp;rdquo; such that one is impelled to say &amp;ldquo;how extraordinary that the world should exist&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not, of course, an experience of the world which is exclusive to the believer. One can wonder at the world without believing in God, and one can feel, with Wittgenstein, that there are things which fall outside the bars of the prison of language. That we still ask ourselves unanswerable questions may be a category error in philosophy, and cause for exasperation in a narrow version of science. But we do, and will continue to do so. That we find meaning in literature and music, in ritual and myth, is equally perplexing if all of life is supposed to be rational. And yet we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many ways, &lt;em&gt;Tractatus &lt;/em&gt;supports a version of the world where mysticism, to use one of Wittgenstein&amp;rsquo;s own metaphors, can be cut away like the rotten bit of an apple. But after 100 years we should still pay heed to Wittgenstein&amp;rsquo;s own reading at the time: &amp;ldquo;My work consists of two parts; that presented here plus all I have not written. It is this second part that is important.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book Review: Exhumation</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5918/book-review-exhumation#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-_16_.jpg" height="807" alt="Exhumation cover" width="911" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What, you might wonder, is the connection between an episode of &lt;em&gt;Dr Who&lt;/em&gt; and a hero of the Indian independence struggle, executed by the British in 1909? Leena Dhingra, the author of &lt;em&gt;Exhumation&lt;/em&gt;, joins the dots for us. As a character actor, she played the role of a 90-year-old Indian woman in an episode in which the Doctor time travels to 17 August 1947, the day when the Radcliffe Line was arbitrarily drawn across the face of India, releasing bloodshed and untold misery. Moved by the parallels between her character&amp;rsquo;s story and her own memories of Partition, which split India from Pakistan, Leena resolved to do some time travelling of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is &lt;em&gt;Exhumation&lt;/em&gt;, which takes the reader back to 1909, when Leena&amp;rsquo;s great uncle, Madan Lal Dhingra, shot Sir Curzon Wyllie, personal assistant to the Secretary of State for India, point blank in the face, and paid for it with his life. The book weaves a double-stranded narrative, following the life and death of Madan Lal along with the author&amp;rsquo;s own journey. Her uncle&amp;rsquo;s fight for an independent India ends in Partition &amp;ndash; the creation of Pakistan as a homeland for Muslims &amp;ndash; and displacement for the young Leena. The Dhingra family were part of the Indian elite and felt deeply compromised by Madan Lal, whose actions were anything but heroic for them. Thus, &lt;em&gt;Exhumation&lt;/em&gt; is both a historical biography and a family memoir.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Madan Lal&amp;rsquo;s remains were returned to a hero&amp;rsquo;s welcome in India in 1976. Leena sees parallels between this exhumation and the act of digging up buried truths in the telling of her own story. The resulting book, however, is arguably more reclamation than exhumation, as it helps Leena find a foothold on this earth, and a reconnection with India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Traces of right-wing Hindu ideology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are darker aspects to how that past now resonates. A fellow anti-imperialist revolutionary, friend and mentor of Madan Lal&amp;rsquo;s, V. D. Savarkar, went on to develop the concept of Hindutva, an exclusivist philosophy that conflates Indian identity with Hindu identity, and has now been adopted by the ultra-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We look for traces of the right-wing Hindu ideologue in this sketch of Savarkar as a young man. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Leena has done a brilliant job in reimagining the history of Madan Lal&amp;rsquo;s times, the fervour of the young Indian students in London and the conservatism of his wealthy family. Yet bringing her uncle to life seems to have been a challenge. This may be down to his character, as, by all accounts, Madan Lal was a reticent man. Even at his trial, having decided to represent himself, he remains tight-lipped, asking for the statement he had prepared in advance of the shooting to be read out (he had planned to turn the gun on himself after killing Wyllie, but ran out of bullets). The statement, which was in his pocket, had been &amp;ldquo;disappeared&amp;rdquo; by the authorities in a typical example of the British stage-managing the trial. The only words that he uttered in court himself were: &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;I do not acknowledge the authority of the court. You can pass sentence of death on me. You white people are all powerful now, but we shall have our turn in time to come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exhumation&lt;/em&gt; keeps us in suspense, hoping that Madan Lal&amp;rsquo;s original statement will be found. Leena finally reproduces an article from the &lt;em&gt;Daily News,&lt;/em&gt; which published the statement in full but declined to say how it got hold of it. However, it is also disappointingly short, at 216 words, and not particularly revelatory of Madan Lal, the man. &amp;ldquo;The only lesson required in India today,&amp;rdquo; it says, &amp;ldquo;is to learn how to die and the only way to teach it is by dying ourselves; therefore I die and glory in my martyrdom.&amp;rdquo; We learn that Churchill quoted these words with admiration as the finest ever made in the name of patriotism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madan Lal is today commemorated as a martyr in the state of Punjab, as well as here in Britain by the Indian Workers Association. But we still know little about him, and &lt;em&gt;Exhumation&lt;/em&gt; only gives us so much. It is as if the writer&amp;rsquo;s imagination trembled in the presence of a corpse buried for so long. But as a blend of historical biography and personal memoir, the book works well. The consequences of that momentous killing continue to reverberate in modern-day India, but Leena Dhingra&amp;rsquo;s personal trauma has been laid to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter edition 2021. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The cult of pi</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5917/the-cult-of-pi#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/pi-1453836_1280.jpg" height="806" alt="Pi" width="1210" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pi (&amp;pi;) is the mathematical symbol used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Or, alternatively, it is how many diameters fit around the periphery of a circle. For at least 4,000 years, people have wondered about the exact value of pi. The Ancient Chinese used three, the Babylonians 3.125, and the Egyptians 3.16049. The reality is that pi&amp;rsquo;s value is fundamentally unknowable. Beyond the decimal point, its digits march on all the way out to infinity. Not only does this make pi an enigmatic number; historically, it has been a shocking one too. Theologians, not surprisingly, were horrified at the idea of a number that was unknowable even to God.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In modern times, finding a record number of digits of pi has become a computational sport &amp;ndash; a convenient measure of the number-crunching power of our cutting-edge computers. The newest record holder, announced in August, is a supercomputer used by Swiss researchers to obtain an astonishing 62.8 trillion digits of pi. The machine, at the Graub&amp;uuml;nden University of Applied Sciences in Chur, laboured for 108 days and nine hours. Though a marathon computation, it took only a third of the time taken to obtain the 50 trillion digits of the previous world record holder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pi is not only a mathematical curiosity. It pops up in all formulae that describe circles wherever they appear in nature: in the spiral double-staircase of DNA, on the surface of the Sun, and, remarkably, even in the meandering of streams and rivers. What all of these things have in common is that they are cycles in space. But pi also pops up in cycles in time: in heartbeats and in all kinds of waves, from ripples on a pond to the electromagnetic waves that carry phone, radio and TV signals around the world. And because the &amp;ldquo;quantum&amp;rdquo; realm which underpins our world is wave-like, pi even appears in the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which describes the fundamental fuzziness of the submicroscopic universe &amp;ndash; how, like a grainy newspaper photograph, it dissolves into nothingness when looked at too closely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pi is so fascinating to some that there is even a Pi Day to celebrate the myriad wonders of the number. It was inaugurated in 1988 by physicist Larry Shaw of San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Exploratorium science museum. Dubbed the &amp;ldquo;Prince of Pi&amp;rdquo;, he chose 14 March because Americans abbreviate pi as 3.14, its first three digits. Albert Einstein was born on Pi Day, while Stephen Hawking died on it. A very special Pi Day was 14 March 2015, or 3.14.15, which encapsulates the first five digits of pi. For most of us, it was a once-in-a-lifetime day &amp;ndash; though not of course for those who are currently over 100 or who will live to be over 100.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gregory Chaitin vs. pi&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, although pi goes on forever, its digits never repeating, it is not the most complicated number imaginable &amp;ndash; at least according to algorithmic information theory. This mathematical field, developed by a 15-year-old Argentinean-American called Gregory Chaitin, equates the complexity of a number with the length of the computer program &amp;ndash; written in the 0s and 1s of binary arithmetic &amp;ndash; needed to generate it. Pi requires a relatively short computer program to create, and so, by this measure, is not a very complex number. By contrast, omega (&amp;Omega;), otherwise known as &amp;ldquo;Chaitin&amp;rsquo;s number&amp;rdquo;, requires an infinitely long computer program. Incapable of being summarised by, or compressed into, fewer digits than its actual length, it makes pi appear a mere pipsqueak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But this does not lessen people&amp;rsquo;s fascination with pi. One person captivated by the number was Carl Sagan, the American planetary scientist and science populariser. In the movie of his novel &lt;em&gt;Contact&lt;/em&gt;, Eleanor Arroway, played by Jodie Foster, finds a message embedded in the digits of pi, left by a super-civilisation responsible for constructing our Universe: a string of 1s and 0s that, when assembled into a grid, depicts&amp;hellip; a circle!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actually, because pi goes on forever, literally any string of numbers will eventually crop up. Sagan was well aware of this, which is why the string of 1s and 0s found by Arroway appears early on in the sequence of digits, left there in order to be easily discovered by the human race.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But pi is a purely mathematical number, defined with no reference to physical reality, and so cannot be adjusted through any scientific advance &amp;ndash; not even by a super-civilisation of highly intelligent aliens. The irony is that Sagan, who was an atheist, was describing something that could only be achieved by a Supreme Being!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>A deadly formula</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5916/a-deadly-formula#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A still from &amp;ldquo;Only Murders in the Building&amp;rdquo;, starring Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin (Disney+)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/oms1_101_cb-3765rt-_1_.jpg" height="533" alt="Only Murders in the Building" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first time that I pressed play on a podcast, it was 2007 and I had just spent half an hour working out how to download the mp3 file. Hearing the hosts&amp;rsquo; voices coming out of my headphones was a thrill. This was a new audio medium where in theory anybody could bypass the traditional media gatekeepers at places like BBC Radio 4 or NPR and find success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, in autumn 2014, I was one of millions of people tuning in to &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;, the account of the producers&amp;rsquo; investigation into the 1999 murder of Korean-American teenager Hae Min Lee that quickly became a global phenomenon. Its on-air reconstructions of Lee&amp;rsquo;s disappearance and its unpacking of contradictory alibis and motives gripped me. The smooth voice of host Sarah Koenig became so influential that it can be heard replicated everywhere today across the true crime podcast genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years on from the release of &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;, I pressed play on the first episode of the new television show &lt;em&gt;Only Murders in the Building&lt;/em&gt;. It stars the unlikely trio of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez as residents of a fancy pre-Second World War apartment block on the Upper West Side in Manhattan who team up to solve a murder after a body is found in their building. They meet, however, because of a podcast. On the night of the crime, the three are separately settling down to enjoy the latest episode of their favourite show, &lt;em&gt;All is Not OK in Oklahoma&lt;/em&gt;, hosted by the &amp;ldquo;queen of true crime&amp;rdquo; Cinda Canning. The building is then evacuated. Desperate for some peace and a reliable internet connection to enjoy the show, the characters band together in a local restaurant to listen.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When the nature of the disruption in their building becomes clear, therefore, it is natural that these true crime podcast obsessives would want to start their own show about it. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect excuse for them to turn amateur sleuth, sneaking around with microphones and covertly interviewing their neighbours. They each come to it with different motivations: Martin&amp;rsquo;s washed-up TV actor Charles-Haden Savage sees it as a chance to get back in the limelight, Short&amp;rsquo;s out of work Broadway director Oliver Putnam senses an opportunity to make some serious cash, and Gomez&amp;rsquo;s Mabel Mora is seemingly the only one who cares about what happened to the victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only Murders in the Building&lt;/em&gt; is a passable mystery series with some gorgeous sets and costumes. It is most interesting, though, as the latest and arguably most successful attempt to date to translate the wild popularity of podcasts onto the screen. References to this audio-only medium are layered into every aspect of the series, from the regular use of voiceover to narrate what the characters are doing to the score, which very deliberately mimics the style of music ubiquitous in true crime podcasts.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For those who have tried to make a podcast themselves (a popular lockdown activity), there are plenty of pleasingly jokey references to the process, too. Martin&amp;rsquo;s character swelters as he records his narration in a makeshift studio in a walk-in wardrobe. Much of the comic dynamic he has with Short comes from the latter&amp;rsquo;s regular insistence that they &amp;ldquo;retake&amp;rdquo; especially meaningful or touching conversations so they can capture a better version.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In one memorable scene, the trio actually get to meet their podcasting hero, Cinda Canning, who is played in a sparkling cameo by Tina Fey (she has Sarah Koenig&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;podcast voice&amp;rdquo; down pat). She takes a call part way through their meeting and confirms that she has just sold her podcast company for $30 million, in a reference to the rush of acquisitions in the real-life podcast industry in the last two years. The closer you look, the more meta it becomes: Canning&amp;rsquo;s blockbuster podcast &lt;em&gt;All is Not OK in Oklahoma&lt;/em&gt; is clearly a parody of &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;, and Serial Productions itself was acquired by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in July 2020 in a deal reportedly worth $25 million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Transforming the podcast industry&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While watching &lt;em&gt;Only Murders in the Building&lt;/em&gt;, I wondered how many of the inside podcast jokes would land with the TV audience. But as the series went on, I remembered that over 100 million people listened to the first series of &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;, and many more have since followed one of the numerous true crime podcasts that launched in its wake. In 2007, making or consuming podcasts was a very niche activity. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s just another form of mass media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lure of television has been a big part of the podcast industry&amp;rsquo;s transformation. Insiders have been talking up the potential of the so-called &amp;ldquo;podcast-to-TV pipeline&amp;rdquo; for some time now, and in the last five years Hollywood studios and streaming giants alike have woken up to the fact that there is a lot of valuable intellectual property, ripe for adaptation, in the audio sphere. After more than a decade of being reliant on changeable advertising revenue, acquisition and rights sales now offer a select few podcasters with a large enough audience alternative, and highly lucrative, revenue streams.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;All of this has resulted in a kind of podcasting gold rush, prompting a series of high-profile acquisitions as major television and audio companies compete to stake the biggest claim in the space. The audio streaming platform Spotify has made a string of such purchases, scooping up the Gimlet network &amp;ndash; known for such narrative podcasts as &lt;em&gt;Reply All &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Crimetown&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; in February 2019 for a reported $200 million, followed by true crime production studio Parcast for $56 million. Subsequent deals have included the $100 million paid to libertarian superstar Joe Rogan in May 2020 to make his podcast exclusive to the Spotify platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that all of this money and talk about the vast potential of adapting podcasts for television has yet to produce a single really good TV series. The closest contender is &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt;, an Amazon drama that debuted in 2018, based on the fiction podcast of the same name. A serviceable but not exceptional thriller, it was the casting of Julia Roberts in her first ever small screen role that occupied most of the critics&amp;rsquo; attention. Even then, this series stands head and shoulders above the rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Adapting the true crime genre&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would be best, meanwhile, not to dwell on the low point represented by &lt;em&gt;Alex, Inc&lt;/em&gt;., which premiered the same year as &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt;. It was an adaptation of the Gimlet podcast &lt;em&gt;Startup&lt;/em&gt;, a non-fiction series that chronicled the podcast company&amp;rsquo;s founding, starring Zach Braff as a radio journalist who quit his job to start a podcast company. It was cancelled after two months, although the highly memeable images of Braff holding microphones wrongly will never be forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true crime podcast genre has been particularly attractive to would-be television adaptors, given its built-in narrative appeal and vast audience, but has similarly failed to generate any real hits. Pulpy, gruesome audio series like &lt;em&gt;Dirty John &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Shrink Next Door&lt;/em&gt; have both made it to the small screen, but failed to make much of an impact in this era of non-stop prestige TV. Non-fiction has fared better, with documentary makers picking up where the &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; team and others have left off, but that genre lacks the astronomical commercial returns possible with a drama or comedy.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;By contrast, &lt;em&gt;Only Murders in the Building&lt;/em&gt; seems to represent a new departure for podcasts on screen. Although not an adaptation of any one audio series, the TV show is so steeped in the form that it is impossible to separate the two. The writers managed to integrate true crime podcast tropes and references without sacrificing the appeal of the main story, and in doing so have created something with the &amp;ldquo;What will happen next?&amp;rdquo; appeal of &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; without exploiting a real tragedy or playing a death for laughs.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Seeing Martin, Short and Gomez tune into their favourite podcast on screen felt familiar, reminding me of all the times I&amp;rsquo;ve waited eagerly for a new episode to drop. Podcasting is part of those characters&amp;rsquo; lives, just as it is for millions of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">People oftenÂ talk about “trials transparency” as if this means “all trials must be published in an academic journal”.

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Someone contacted me hoping to find young atheists who might be interested in being part of a new series. I’m not particularly interested in having my mug on TV, but I would love to have some great personalities represent atheism on the show, so I offered to repost his email on my blog: My name […]</div>
