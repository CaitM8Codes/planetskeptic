    <title>Teaching in Kansas sure must be different</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/05/02/teaching-in-kansas-sure-must-be-different/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;The pedagogical methods of Mark Samsel wouldn&amp;#8217;t fly here. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article251069219.html"&gt;they weren&amp;#8217;t even successful in Kansas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas state Rep. Mark Samsel was arrested on charges of misdemeanor battery on Thursday after getting into a physical altercation with a student while substitute teaching in Wellsville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsel, 36, was booked into the Franklin County Adult Detention Center after 3:30 p.m. Thursday. He has since been released on $1,000 bond, Sheriff Jeff Richards said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superintendent Ryan Bradbury said that Samsel will no longer be allowed to work for the district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, he&amp;#8217;s a Republican state representative, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; he works as a substitute teacher. He&amp;#8217;s screwing over the citizens of the state in two ways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t quite figure out what courses he was supposed to be teaching. It sounds like he thought he was in Sunday school, and was wandering about moralizing and wagging his finger at everyone and giving incoherent advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Samsel, R-Wellsville, was substitute teaching at the Wellsville school district’s secondary school. Throughout the day, high school students began recording videos of the lawmaker talking about suicide, sex, masturbation, God and the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one video shared with The Star, Samsel tells students about “a sophomore who’s tried killing himself three times,” adding that it was because “he has two parents and they’re both females.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s a foster kid. His alternatives in life were having no parents or foster care parents who are gay,” Samsel tells students. “How do you think I’m going to feel if he commits suicide? Awful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another video, Samsel is recorded telling students, “make babies. Who likes making babies? That feels good, doesn’t it? Procreate &amp;#8230; You haven’t masturbated? Don’t answer that question&amp;#8230;.God already knows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seems to have been harassing one student in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Samsel tells the student, “You’re about ready to anger me and get the wrath of God. Do you believe me when I tell you that God has been speaking to me?” He then pushes him, and the student runs to the other side of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should run and scream.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another video, he tells students, “Class, you have permission to kick him in the balls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents told The Star that Samsel “put hands on the student” and allegedly kneed him in the crotch. In a video apparently taken immediately after the incident, the student is shown on the ground. Samsel is standing over him and says, “did it hurt?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then asks him why he is about to start crying, pats him on the shoulder and apologizes, and then says he can “go to the nurse, she can check it for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsel addresses another student and says, “do you want to check his nuts for him, please?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he&amp;#8217;s out, and he&amp;#8217;s claiming that he meant to do that. He was &amp;#8220;sending a message&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Snapchat post shared with The Star, Samsel wrote that “it was all planned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every little bit of it. That’s right. The kids and I planned ALL this to SEND A MESSAGE about art, mental health, teenage suicide, how we treat our educators and one another. To who? Parents. And grandparents. And all of Wellsville,” he posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote that he gave one particular student “hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to jail for battery. Does that really make me a criminal? Time will tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the incident happened during fifth period, and that the classes before that hour went as planned, and he shared the same lesson in each one. He said what happened was “exactly what God planned. The kids were in on it. Not all of them. But most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what message he was sending. I do know that kicking your students in the crotch does make you a criminal, and I don&amp;#8217;t believe for a moment that he was implementing a god&amp;#8217;s plan. He was just an incompetent jerk who ought not to be allowed anywhere near a school. Or a statehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article251112569.html"&gt;Videos here&lt;/a&gt;. His classroom seems to have been nothing but self-indulgent chaos and Christian abuse. At least he has &amp;#8220;apologized&amp;#8221;. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/05/levarburton.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/05/levarburton-113x150.jpg" alt="" width="113" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-62630" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/05/levarburton-113x150.jpg 113w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/05/levarburton-225x300.jpg 225w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/05/levarburton-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/05/levarburton-500x667.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/05/levarburton.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="lead"&gt;LeVar Burton is something special &amp;#8212; he is beyond being a &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; communicator, and is more of a &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; communicator, which is something we desperately need. Science is beautiful, but so are history and literature and philosophy and art and all human endeavors that make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he appeared on The View, and Megan McCain, of course, thought she&amp;#8217;d challenge him with the Dr Seuss &amp;#8220;ban&amp;#8221; (it wasn&amp;#8217;t) and that deplorable cancel culture, and he gently and succinctly shot her down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSffc2uRueA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of cancel culture, I think it&amp;#8217;s misnamed — that&amp;#8217;s a misnomer. I think we have a consequence culture and that consequences are finally encompassing everybody in the society, whereas they haven&amp;#8217;t been, ever, in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are good signs in the culture, and I think it has everything to do with a new awareness on people who were simply unaware of the real nature of life in this country for people who have been othered since this nation began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice. Listen to LeVar, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="lead">I’m working on the final exam for my introductory biology course which is laced with Darwinism, but also with the philosophy of science, and early on I’d introduced them to Occam’s Razor. I’d tried to explain to them then that while it’s a useful operational tool in designing appropriate experiments, it’s almost never true that the simplest answer is the correct answer, at least not in biology. And then I stumbled across this article on <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/simplici/">Simplicity in the Philosophy of Science</a> by Simon Fitzpatrick that summed up that same point nicely.</p>
<blockquote><p>It should be noted, however, that not all scientists agree that simplicity should be regarded as a legitimate criterion for theory choice. The eminent biologist Francis Crick once complained, “[w]hile Occam’s razor is a useful tool in physics, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research” (Crick, 1988, p138). Similarly, here are a group of earth scientists writing in Science:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many scientists accept and apply [Ockham’s Razor] in their work, even though it is an entirely metaphysical assumption. There is scant empirical evidence that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely than complex ones to be true. Our commitment to simplicity is largely an inheritance of 17th-century theology. (Oreskes et al, 1994, endnote 25)</p></blockquote>

<p>Oooh, I’ll have to make a note of that for the next time I argue with an Intelligent Design creationist who thinks complexity is a hallmark of design.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, rummaging around in philosophy articles is not a good way to come up with testable questions for a first year biology course, and I still don’t have a good idea on this topic for the exam. I suppose I could just put that quote on a page and ask them to explain why Crick and Oreskes would say such things, but for the sake of my sanity, I’m avoiding asking for long essays from freshman students. I’m sure my students could handle it, but then I’d have to <em>read</em> 50 such essays, and I don’t think I could.</p>

    <title>The forgotten women of humanist history</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5792/the-forgotten-women-of-humanist-history#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Campaigner for women&amp;rsquo;s rights Dr Alice Vickery" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/KMMMPH.jpg" height="648" alt="KMMMPH" width="412" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The British ethical societies, forerunners of Humanists UK, emerged in the 1880s. As the London Ethical Society put it in its first report in 1887, they offered a basis for &amp;ldquo;well-doing and well-being&amp;rdquo; cut loose from supernatural beliefs. In a century which witnessed the publication of Darwin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, the societies responded to the &amp;ldquo;breaking up of older modes of thought and feeling&amp;rdquo; with a lived philosophy based in rationality, goodness and reform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Victorian women were prized as stewards of family and faith; portrayed as selfless, pious and divinely wrought for the role of wife and mother. Yet despite these supposedly God-given traits, they could occupy only marginal roles within organised religious bodies. This was, as Barbara Taylor has written, an &amp;ldquo;ideal of femininity which combined holy love with social subordination&amp;rdquo;. It was emphasised with special force in the early 19th century, in the wake of revolution overseas, and fears of radicalism at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;With women&amp;rsquo;s vital &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo; rooted in the upholding and passing on of society&amp;rsquo;s social and moral values, their position in relation to religious faith and morality was particularly vulnerable to examination and criticism, not least in the case of the unbeliever. As the &lt;em&gt;Manchester Evening News &lt;/em&gt;wrote in 1892, ethical societies offered a space for &amp;ldquo;those who [had] no longer a place in established religious organisations&amp;rdquo;, providing not only an alternative Sunday activity, but a network in support of humane and reasoned reform across all areas of society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The men of the movement have been remembered as its driving forces, but this neglects the numerous women who populated and propelled it. Many of these were active in efforts towards social change, often with a focus on those areas in which Christian concepts of morality had undue sway. Among these were May Seaton-Tiedeman, described in a 1960s House of Lords debate as &amp;ldquo;a woman of tremendous dynamism and drive&amp;rdquo;, who championed divorce law reform tirelessly for decades; Dr Alice Vickery, a lifelong campaigner for reproductive rights; and socialist feminist Zona Vallance, whose early death in 1904 cut short a life devoted to women&amp;rsquo;s legal and financial equality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;These were women who dispensed with ideas of God-given morality and instead used reason and compassion as a basis for living, and for seeking social change. The ethical societies were full of women who worked in areas of social reform, medicine, education and the arts, and derived their sense of duty from the &amp;ldquo;purely human&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;***&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;The first English ethical society was formed in 1886 in London, intending to establish &amp;ldquo;a rational conception of human good&amp;rdquo;, by way of education, discussion and fellowship. This, and the many others that followed, acknowledged that an increase in scientific understanding had helped to convince many of the inadequacy of religious ideas: &amp;ldquo;their reverence&amp;rdquo; for which, wrote the London Ethical Society, &amp;ldquo;has been undermined by the necessary progress of thought&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The ethical societies set morality apart from theology, and required no avowal (or disavowal) of traditional religious belief. In taking ethics as their basis, their very name preempted accusations of moral waste in the unbeliever. While some societies actively sought to redefine the concepts of &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;religion&amp;rdquo; to mean aspiring towards the good, many simply set aside those terms altogether. In either case, the ethical societies provided a more socially acceptable means of expressing unbelief, for middle-class women in particular, than a public disavowal of Christianity and churchgoing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The first half of the century had seen outspoken, irreligious women harshly castigated. Susannah Wright was described in the press as the &amp;ldquo;She-Champion of Impiety&amp;rdquo;, secularist Eliza Sharples as a &amp;ldquo;pythoness&amp;rdquo;. The sex of the female infidel made her a particular target of ire, and criticisms were frequently girded by the acute horror of femininity betrayed. In the same century&amp;rsquo;s final decades, the notion of morality and respectability apart from Christianity remained controversial. Six years before the emergence of the ethical societies in Britain, Julia Stephen &amp;ndash; whose husband Leslie Stephen was president of the West London Ethical Society &amp;ndash; was prompted to write an (unpublished) defence of the agnostic woman, in answer to an article by Bertha Lathbury which had appeared in April 1880.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Lathbury&amp;rsquo;s essay gave new expression to long-held fears about the non-religious woman: that the abandonment of Christianity meant a betrayal of womanhood itself, and a breakdown in the social order. She warned of the impact of agnosticism on the heart of women (their most defining element), which would leave them broken and less likely to perform their primary duties in society. Lathbury argued that women, in abandoning their belief in a higher power and an afterlife, would see the education of the poor as futile (awareness of one&amp;rsquo;s poverty only brings misery without the promise of a better hereafter), and would no longer see the virtue of caring for the elderly or impaired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Clearly affronted, Stephen stated firmly that &amp;ldquo;purity of life, sincerity of action, obedience to law, [and] love of our fellow creatures&amp;rdquo; were all quite possible without religious belief or adherence to doctrine. She took aim, too, at the distinction between the sexes in matters of reason and religion. In &amp;ldquo;the acceptance or rejection of a creed,&amp;rdquo; Stephen wrote, &amp;ldquo;let the woman be judged as the man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Examples abound of members of the ethical societies who lent their weight to Stephen&amp;rsquo;s argument, and many leading figures wrote and spoke on the need for a new conception of the moral impulse. Zona Vallance, the first secretary of the Union of Ethical Societies (the inaugural Chief Executive of Humanists UK), stated this clearly in her article &amp;ldquo;The Ethical Movement and Women&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p6"&gt;Our ideal of human goodness cannot remain the same as when we believed a Supernatural Father played providence over the race, and allotted, with divine fore-knowledge, a station and duties to each and all&amp;hellip; Individual goodness is no longer obedience to ten Commandments or two, but a condition of relatedness which has variations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;This &amp;ldquo;condition of relatedness&amp;rdquo;, freed from any notion of &amp;ldquo;supernatural rewards and punishments&amp;rdquo;, animated numerous women in their membership of the ethical societies, and in a host of progressive, reformist efforts, both outside and as part of the movement. So too did the feminist call that it contained for equality between the sexes and increased opportunities for women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;***&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;A concern for children and their education was a key aspect of the societies&amp;rsquo; aims, with &amp;ldquo;moral&amp;rdquo; instruction forefronted from the earliest days. Alice Woods, an active member and pioneer of co-education, argued that the job of education was to teach the next generation to improve on the world of their parents, and to live better together, learning from history and adapting to a changing society &amp;ndash; with a focus on working for this world, not the next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The ethical societies offered a means not merely of expressing a lack of belief in traditional theological ideas, but of making a positive assertion of belief in humanity. This remains central to the appeal of humanism today, and for the emergent ethical societies of the late Victorian period and early 20th century it provided a significant defence against the derisive charge of &amp;ldquo;agnosticism&amp;rdquo;, so often synonymous with amorality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The arguments against the non-religious woman popular in the 19th century seem grossly outdated now. But in significant ways they are not unfamiliar to those who have been met with incredulity, or a questioning of their moral compass, in expressing unbelief. For late Victorian women, and well into the 20th century, the ethical societies enabled a focus on moral action rather than theological abstraction, championing progressive social reform and helping lend respectability to atheism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article draws on research carried out for the Humanist Heritage project, celebrating 125 years of Humanists UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist spring 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>‘‘We can stop politics from creating new forms of tyranny’’</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5790/we-can-stop-politics-from-creating-new-forms-of-tyranny#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Yanis-Varoufakis.jpg" height="412" alt="Yanis-Varoufakis" width="575" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yanis Varoufakis is an economist, head of the radical MeRA25 party in Greece, and a working MP in Athens&amp;rsquo; Hellenic Parliament. He previously served as Greece&amp;rsquo;s finance minister, and is the author of several best-selling books about economics and global capitalism. His latest book &amp;ldquo;Another Now: Dispatches from an Alternative Present&amp;rdquo; (Bodley Head) is a novel which imagines a world in which &amp;ldquo;Occupy and Extinction Rebellion actually won&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; with no banks, no stock market and no tech giants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You normally write non-fiction. Why turn to science fiction with your latest book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was trying to imagine a [scenario] where a post-capitalist world could be desirable. I wanted to blend into my narrative a Platonic dialogue that connects radical politics with philosophical questions like: what would make us genuinely happy? Who are we? And what is [life] all about? Plato [often talked] about how a craving for power enslaves human beings as much as it liberates them. We can stop politics from creating new forms of tyranny if we maintain a genuine and honest dialogue with ourselves about what matters to us as humans. Talking honestly about politics means talking about our existential angst as human beings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The novel explores questions of technology and power. Are we powerless against big tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first step is understanding our own power. If you are plugged into your laptop at home you don&amp;rsquo;t feel you have power. You are a consumer who is isolated, and facing a Goliath. But collectively you have immense power, if only you can get organised. The creation of trade unions during the 19th century taught us this. We need to envision a technological world in which power comes to the many.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your novel imagines the European Central Bank (ECB) giving every adult citizen in the Eurozone a free current account. Could this work in reality?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Central Bank in China is already giving [every citizen] a bank account because it&amp;rsquo;s introducing a digital currency. Effectively, this means the money you have is with the Central Bank. Digitisation of money is unstoppable and it will eventually see residents of Eurozone countries having a [personal] account with the ECB. This will change the role of commercial banks. If all Eurozone residents have a digital account with the ECB &amp;ndash; with a pin number that allows them to carry out transactions, etc &amp;ndash; why would the ECB first give the money to, say, Deutsche Bank? If you combine this idea with the end of the share market you overcome the complete [domination] of financial markets as we presently understand them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you want to abolish global financial markets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want a market society. But there are two markets I can easily live without: the share market, including the money market. And the labour market. These are creating a class division between capitalism and human interest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the scenario you are describing a world where Marx&amp;rsquo;s surplus value theory no longer exists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes. I want to see the end of Marxism. But that is what every Marxist wants. Marxism is just a theory of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you so critical of capitalism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe capitalism enslaves everybody: both the rich and the poor. In &lt;em&gt;Das Kapital&lt;/em&gt; Marx explains the angst of the capitalist who has to squeeze every ounce of value from the workers. If the capitalist doesn&amp;rsquo;t do this, somebody else will undercut them [and] they will go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would a post-capitalist society look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I cannot predict the future. Every era keeps making the mistake that capitalism is here to stay for ever. Because we live in a capitalist society, people assume it&amp;rsquo;s the natural order of the world and it will remain like this indefinitely. But citizens of the Roman Empire could never envision the empire collapsing. Capitalism is not going to continue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will bring about its demise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you combine the exorbitant privilege of bankers who can create money out of thin air with share markets, you have a situation where democracy is impossible. The main problem is power tends to be invested with the financiers and the bankers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the left that is going to overthrow capitalism, it&amp;rsquo;s capitalism itself. There will no longer be any need for corporations if you can print a car, a washing machine or a solar panel. The old idea of capitalism is finished. I don&amp;rsquo;t assume what follows capitalism will automatically be good. It could be a dystopia. But a post-capitalist world is going to happen anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are the left so weak globally at the moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To answer that we need to go back to the beginning of the 20th century: when the left backed two horses to detrimental effects. [Some] supported communism in the Soviet Union: that road led to the Gulag and the dictatorship of a bureaucracy. [Others] went towards social democracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did the social democrats go wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They made two grave mistakes. Firstly, to ditch the narrative of liberty and emancipation. This had been part of the Marxist tradition in the 19th century. The whole point of the left was to break the shackles: for workers and for women. But the left ditched freedom for equality and justice. But one must ask: equality of what? Also, justice is a fluffy term with very little meaning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly, social democrats sold their soul to the devil by going into bed with the financiers. During the 1960s social democrats were all about creating a balance between industrialists and trade unions. But by the late 1980s most of the money was being made in the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Britain, under Tony Blair, the Labour Party &amp;ndash; to pay for the National Health Service &amp;ndash; began to get a cut of the huge profits financiers were making in the City of London. But when the 2008 financial crash happened, the social democrats started the austerity programme and lost all credibility with the working class. The left is now in tatters and still trying to recover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why have we seen such a global shift towards xenophobic right-wing populism over the last decade?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xenophobia is the end result of globalisation failing. It arose from the huge economic crisis that spawned in 2008 and has ballooned ever since. I am an internationalist who opposes globalisation. Globalisation is about capital moving anywhere: it rushes into countries to create bubbles, then those bubbles burst, leaving behind nothing but pain, while people are barricaded behind fences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internationalism, on the other hand, is about seeing humanity as one species with one common interest. Internationalism constrains the freedom of capital and power to inflict damage on the many. But internationalism is also about giving people the time and freedom to move around, set up their own companies and trade without the border being a hard barrier to stop the free flow of humanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the outbreak of Covid-19 &amp;ndash; and the extensive measures most western democracies introduced &amp;ndash; made you reflect on the role of state power? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is now abundantly clear that governments and politicians are not powerless. When this global pandemic first began our governments had the power to lock us into our apartments for three months. As a libertarian Marxist I don&amp;rsquo;t think greater state power is necessarily a good thing. I grew up in a dictatorship [in Greece] where the state had extreme power. We had a curfew every night that was imposed by fascists. Many leftists are now assuming that greater state power is good. But it could be power for surveillance capitalism to dictate the rules of the game for every one of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist spring 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Saying goodbye to the dead</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5765/saying-goodbye-to-the-dead#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Image by Lorie Shaull" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/A_person_holds_a_Rest_In_Power_sign_outside_the_Hennepin_County_Courthouse_in_downtown_Minneapolis,_Minnesota_as_the_trial_of_former_Minneapolis_police_officer_Derek_Chauvin_began_Monday_mor1.jpg" alt="Image" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to be rational at a time of loss and grief. No-one expects us to make much sense when we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with death close at hand. So the way we think about dying and death sometimes lags behind the way we think about everything else; old ways, old habits of thought and language, hang on where they otherwise might have been swept away. "Rest in peace", we say (or tweet, or hashtag on Insta, or type under sad Facebook posts). What do we mean? What do we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we mean?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously we have in mind some sort of quiet repose, an eternal nap. It&amp;rsquo;s an invitation to the dead (or an instruction: &lt;em&gt;relax&lt;/em&gt;, for god&amp;rsquo;s sake), to take it easy, kick back, enjoy &amp;ndash; enjoy whatever it is that&amp;rsquo;s going on, where they are. The wet silence of the subsoil. The fresh-laundered library quiet of heaven. Or oblivion &amp;ndash; a possibility that raises some questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can there be a happy oblivion? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure oblivion can be said to have any qualities at all. "To die, to sleep, no more," says Hamlet, "tis a consummation devoutly to be wished". What springs to my mind if I picture myself resting in peace is a sort of pleasant, warm, half-awake doze, perhaps with the cricket on the radio, and the cat asleep on my feet &amp;ndash; is this what eternity is meant to look like?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps "rest in peace" is best understood from a darker perspective &amp;ndash; starting from the premise that all life is struggle and heartbreak, it&amp;rsquo;s only a small step to the conclusion that even oblivion has to be better than this. Some gentleness, finally, for the tormented &amp;ndash; a safe space with the lights turned down and the outside world set to mute. "Peace At Last", reads Lenny Bruce&amp;rsquo;s epitaph (it kind of recalls Swift&amp;rsquo;s: "Savage indignation," in Yeats&amp;rsquo; translation, "cannot lacerate his breast").&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those of us who think of death as a full-stop, an absolute ending, still find ourselves reaching for "RIP" when someone we care about &amp;ndash; whether we knew them or not &amp;ndash; passes away (and there I go again: passes away to where? Of course I mean &lt;em&gt;dies&lt;/em&gt;). We just don&amp;rsquo;t know what else to say. Sometimes we say "go well", which sounds a bit sort of solemnly Viking-ish but leaves us in the same sticky spot, philosophically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The troubled American twenty-first century brought us a fresher, fightier take on "RIP", as the death of the US graffiti artist "Dream" Francisco prompted the first known use of "Rest In Power" &amp;ndash; an intimation that the values of a person live on after them, that their fight goes on, that their strength can still give strength to others, and that even in death they can still shape the world. The term grew in popularity as an activist elegy through the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement &amp;ndash; only to be co-opted, as Rochelle Hampton wrote in &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;, by the mainstream: "It can now mean everything, and so ultimately might mean nothing."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a traditional Jewish benediction that I&amp;rsquo;m fond of: "May their memory be a blessing." Again, it&amp;rsquo;s about the capacity of a person to reach beyond the span of their physical life &amp;ndash; to change the world without being in it. We are often uncomfortably balanced, in times of loss, between two desires: to mourn a death, and to celebrate a life (the European practice of clapping at sports events in memory of the departed co-exists uneasily, here, with the traditional minute&amp;rsquo;s silence).&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;If we say "may their memory be a blessing", we express, I think, a little of each: the joy they brought us will stay with us, but there is, in the phrase, an absence, an implicit acknowledgement that they are, even so, only a memory, now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Twitter, "RIP" is ubiquitous. It&amp;rsquo;s a useful and universal shorthand. But the English writer Eamonn Griffin has a different approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On October 27, 2013, Griffin marked the death of Lou Reed with a tweet: "Lou Reed, ladies and gentlemen." It soon became habitual &amp;ndash; a brief, simple, but warm and engaging way of saying goodbye. Writers, musicians, sportspeople, cult figures in movies or TV &amp;ndash; anyone, really, whose death touches him some way. Tzvetan Todorov, Carrie Fisher, Ronnie Corbett, Beverly "Guitar" Watkins &amp;ndash; dozens, hundreds, over the years. It&amp;rsquo;s a personal curation, Griffin says, when we speak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a not-much gesture to a few thousand followers, but I find it weirdly affecting. I want to know how he hears it, in his head, when he tweets it out. I picture an old-school variety comp&amp;eacute;re, in sideburns and a shiny suit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There&amp;rsquo;s definitely an element of that," he says, "of a comp&amp;eacute;re, arm outstretched as the person leaves the stage, segueing from one performer to the next. Not with the brash ebullience of a circus ringmaster, but something more low-key. Not quite working men&amp;rsquo;s club stoicism either, but definitely understated. Like a late-night DJ switching from one song to the next. So there&amp;rsquo;s something about that person having done their bit &amp;ndash; but not to worry because there&amp;rsquo;s more to come too."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no wrong way, of course, to say goodbye, to make commemoration. But this works for me. It&amp;rsquo;s about what they were, what they did, and what they meant to us, these people we&amp;rsquo;ve lost &amp;ndash; wherever they might be now. More than that, though, it says: mourn how you want. Clap or sit silently. Grieve or don&amp;rsquo;t grieve. This was them, this person, a one-off, a life lived to completion &amp;ndash; thank you, and goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Islands of Abandonment</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5789/book-review-islands-of-abandonment#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/islands.jpg" height="503" alt="islands" width="314" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Cloud islands, they are called. The peaks of the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania rise so high that fogs form on their slopes where the cool mountain air meets warmer currents rising off the sea. The climate has created a unique ecosystem, as real islands do, and much of the wildlife is unique to the area. Even there, much of it is vanishingly rare. The Amani tree frog, for instance, was discovered in 1926 inside a wild banana; it has never been seen again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;At least, that is how things were, Cal Flyn writes in &lt;em&gt;Islands of Abandonment&lt;/em&gt;, her consistently rewarding, eloquently provocative new book. In 1902, the authorities in what was then German East Africa built the Amani Biological-Agricultural Institute there, planting several thousand species of tree and plant. But no one tended the gardens. Researchers worried that indigenous species would be overrun. The concerns were well founded: the umbrella tree ran riot, at one point accounting for a third of new-growth forests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;More than half of the most invasive plant species in the world have escaped from botanical gardens. One lake in Java has lost 70 per cent of its surface to water hyacinth, derived from a garden 500 miles away. The escape of a species of giant rhododendron from Kew in the 19th century was so notorious one newspaper ran a cartoon of the plant scaling the walls and absconding on a number 27 bus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But at Amani, an interesting thing happened. Sometime this century, a native fungus started attacking the umbrella tree, wreaking havoc on its numbers. Given enough time, nature will find an equilibrium. As for humanity, even when we try to do good, we often do harm. &amp;ldquo;We run the Earth as if it were one giant botanical garden to tend: passing judgement on species, playing God,&amp;rdquo; Flyn writes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Islands of Abandonment&lt;/em&gt; is about what happens when we stop. Stop with the damage, sure: the ravages of war, industrialisation, ideology. But stop interfering too. Step back, let things happen. Nature is an orchestra that wants to improvise; we should stop insisting it sticks to the score. In pursuit of this thesis, Flyn reports from some extraordinary locations: the book&amp;rsquo;s itinerary includes a First World War chemical weapons site where the soil is 17 per cent arsenic; a derelict fertiliser plant that left behind levels of dioxin which reach 1.65 billion times the safe limit; and Chernobyl&amp;rsquo;s Dead Zone, the most radioactive place on the planet. It is a brave book, in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But, without once flinching from the horror, Flyn finds cause for hope in even the most toxic and despoiled of environments. Left alone, wildness revives. Around the world, there are now some 2.9 billion hectares of what is called &amp;ldquo;recovering secondary vegetation&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; former arable and pasture, and regrowing forests &amp;ndash; more than twice the area under crop. Russia may have met the terms of the Kyoto Protocol through the abandonment of farmland alone. Flyn describes a fish which can survive in waters so saline the human equivalent might be drinking petrol. She says it has a superpower: adaptation. But really, it is nature &amp;ndash; the vast and intricate ecosystems of the planet, almost transcendental in their interconnectedness &amp;ndash; that is the source of this power, as Flyn sets out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Why, though, are we unable to let go? One of the great strengths of this subtle and profound book is that it is also a quiet exploration of aesthetics in the natural world, of how we conceive beauty and value; not many books of nature writing cite Marcel Duchamp approvingly. More, Flyn understands that our relationship with the planet is conditioned by deep-rooted cultural frameworks and eschatologies. With an apocalypse coming, we look back guiltily at our Edens; the psychologies of transgression and redemption, sin and forgiveness, stalk our every thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;But perhaps the boldest choice Flyn has made is to include urban sites blighted by population loss and industrial decline &amp;ndash; and the people who live in them &amp;ndash; among her islands. One chapter is dedicated to Detroit, a city whose population has shrunk by some two-thirds and in which 80,000 properties are now vacant, crumbling into ruin. Why do people stay? Why have people returned to the Dead Zone around Chernobyl? Why does any living thing return to these toxic, tragic places?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is nothing like it used to be,&amp;rdquo; a Detroit resident tells Flyn. &amp;ldquo;But it is home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Saints alive!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5788/saints-alive#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHUmanistStLaurie.jpg" height="586" alt="NewHUmanistStLaurie" width="329" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;There is one extraordinarily important vowel in my forename: the letter &amp;ldquo;U&amp;rdquo;. For the whole of her life on earth, my mother insisted that &amp;ldquo;Laurie&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Lawrie&amp;rdquo;, from Laurence and Lawrence, were not merely alternative spellings but marked a profound doctrinal distinction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;For whereas Laurence was as truly Catholic as the Virgin Mary and the Pope, Lawrence was fundamentally Protestant. There were no two ways about it. Laurence, as all good Papists knew, was named after Saint Laurence, who was martyred in the persecution of the Christians that was ordered by the Roman emperor Valerian in 258. The name meant &amp;ldquo;covered in laurels&amp;rdquo;. Lawrence was therefore an &lt;br /&gt;heretical aberration. After all, who ever heard of anyone being &amp;ldquo;crowned with lawrels&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Neither did my mother hold any truck with the alternative versions of Saint Laurence&amp;rsquo;s martyrdom. She knew with all the certainty of a true Catholic that he was slowly roasted to death on a gridiron and proved his bravery by somewhat colloquially announcing, after suffering pain for a long time, &amp;ldquo;Turn me over. I&amp;rsquo;m well done on this side.&amp;rdquo; I can only be glad that mother died before she could hear the claim by historian Patrick Healy that the whole legend was based on a spelling mistake in which &lt;em&gt;passus est&lt;/em&gt; (he suffered) was made to read &lt;em&gt;assus est &lt;/em&gt;(he was roasted).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;But this childhood knowledge regarding my name hardly exhausted my interest in saints. As a nine-year-old at the Sacred Heart boarding school in Droitwich, I was constantly enjoined by the resident priests to pray for the canonisation of the founder of the Sacred Heart order, Michael Garicoits, a 19th-century French Basque priest whose claim to sainthood was at least partly based on the news that on several occasions he had been seen rising from the ground at the consecration part of the mass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;This was not quite enough. Two other attested miracles were needed before canonisation could ensue. Thankfully, our juvenile prayers were answered and the necessary miracles turned up: simple Michael became Saint Michael.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;My schoolboy pride in having played a small part in the eventual canonisation of Michael Garicoits was only marginally tempered by Francis Dilworth, a somewhat dilapidated fifth-former at my Christian Brothers secondary school. During milk break one morning he told me about a famous philosopher called Hume who had come up with not one but five reasons for not believing in miracles of any sort. Best of all, according to Francis, was the one that employed a dramatic device known as Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor. This asserted that the simplest explanation for any puzzling phenomenon was usually the correct one. What this meant, whispered Francis across the line of desks, was that for a miracle to be true, denial of a miracle would have to be more miraculous than its acceptance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Suppose, he said, we look at the miracle of the Resurrection, at the story that Jesus not only came back from the dead, but then put in several personal appearances to his still living apostles. Now, applying Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor, what is more likely? That those making the claim are mistaken, or that Jesus actually came back to life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It would be too glib to claim that Francis&amp;rsquo;s cynicism destroyed my childhood fascination with the miraculous, with the proliferation of loaves and fishes, the liquefaction of martyrs&amp;rsquo; blood or the raising of Lazarus. Something far more trivial, far more blunt than a razor, finally curbed that obsession.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;It was nothing more than the story of a man who had been confined to a wheelchair after a shocking road accident and was endeavouring to obtain a large sum in insurance from a well-known company. The insurance agent in question was so sceptical that he instituted court proceedings to establish the man&amp;rsquo;s credibility. After the judge found for the man, the agent was still surprisingly jubilant. &amp;ldquo;From now on,&amp;rdquo; he told the claimant, &amp;ldquo;I will follow you to the ends of the earth to ensure that you are forever confined to that wheelchair. So, tell me, where are you off to now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The reply was chillingly succinct. &amp;ldquo;Lourdes,&amp;rdquo; said the claimant.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

<p>I am delighted to launch a new series of videos that use magic to celebrate science. Fab sleight of hand artist Will Houstoun and I produced them, supported by The Royal Society of Chemistry and chemist Dr Suzanne Fergus (University of Hertfordshire). The three videos use sleight of hand techniques to celebrate a different scientist, and do not involve any CGI or camera trickery. </p>



<p>We are excited about this new story telling technique and recently conducted an experiment that showed that it significantly boosted people’s engagement (details <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://peerj.com/articles/9610/" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>



<p>I hope that you enjoy them!</p>

    <title>Can We Pull Back From The Brink?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://samharris.org/can-pull-back-brink/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this episode of the podcast, Sam discusses the recent social protests and civil unrest, in light of what we know about racism and police violence in America.</p>
<p>This is a transcript of a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/207-can-pull-back-brink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded podcast</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Welcome to the Making Sense podcast… This is Sam Harris.</p>
<p>OK…. Well, I’ve been trying to gather my thoughts for this podcast for more than a week—and have been unsure about whether to record it at all, frankly.</p>
<p>Conversation is the only tool we have for making progress, I firmly believe that. But many of the things we most need to talk about, seem impossible to talk about.</p>
<p>I think social media is a huge part of the problem. I’ve been saying for a few years now that, with social media, we’ve all been enrolled in a psychological experiment for which no one gave consent, and it’s not at all clear how it will turn out. And it’s still not clear how it will turn out, but it’s not looking good. It’s fairly disorienting out there. All information is becoming weaponized. All communication is becoming performative. And on the most important topics, it now seems to be fury and sanctimony and bad faith almost all the time.</p>
<p>We appear to be driving ourselves crazy. Actually, crazy. As in, incapable of coming into contact with reality, unable to distinguish fact from fiction—and then becoming totally destabilized by our own powers of imagination, and confirmation bias, and then lashing out at one other on that basis.</p>
<p>So I’d like to talk about the current moment and the current social unrest, and its possible political implications, and other cultural developments, and suggest what it might take to pull back from the brink here. I’m going to circle in on the topics of police violence and the problem of racism, because that really is at the center of this. There is so much to talk about here, and it’s so difficult to talk about. And there is so much we don’t know. And yet, most people are behaving as though every important question was answered a long time ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching our country seem to tear itself apart for weeks now, and perhaps lay the ground for much worse to come. And I’ve been resisting the temptation to say anything of substance—not because I don’t have anything to say, but because of my perception of the danger, frankly. And if that’s the way I feel, given the pains that I’ve taken to insulate myself from those concerns, I know that almost everyone with a public platform is terrified. Journalists, and editors, and executives, and celebrities are terrified that they might take one wrong step here, and never recover.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdsmxzaHtSQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"/></p>
<p>And this is really unhealthy—not just for individuals, but for society. Because, again, all we have between us and the total breakdown of civilization is a series of successful conversations. If we can’t reason with one another, there is no path forward, other than violence. Conversation or violence.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to talk about some of the things that concern me about the current state of our communication. Unfortunately, many things are compounding our problems at the moment. We have a global pandemic which is still very much with us. And it remains to be seen how much our half-hearted lockdown, and our ineptitude in testing, and our uncoordinated reopening, and now our plunge into social protest and civil unrest will cause the Covid-19 caseload to spike. We will definitely see. As many have pointed out, the virus doesn’t care about economics or politics. It only cares that we keep breathing down each other’s necks. And we’ve certainly been doing enough of that.</p>
<p>Of course, almost no one can think about Covid-19 right now. But I’d just like to point out that many of the costs of this pandemic and the knock-on effects in the economy, and now this protest movement, many of these costs are hidden from us. In addition to killing more than 100,000 people in the US, the pandemic has been a massive opportunity cost. The ongoing implosion of the economy is imposing tangible costs, yes, but it is also a massive opportunity cost. And now this civil unrest is compounding those problems—whatever the merits of these protests may be or will be, the opportunity costs of this moment are staggering. In addition to all the tangible effects of what’s happening—the injury and death, the lost businesses, the burned buildings, the neighborhoods that won’t recover for years in many cities, the educations put on hold, and the breakdown in public trust of almost every institution—just think about all the good and important things we cannot do—cannot even <em>think</em> of doing now—and perhaps won’t contemplate doing for many years to come, because we’ll be struggling to get back to that distant paradise we once called “normal life.”</p>
<p>Of course, normal life for many millions of Americans was nothing like a paradise. The disparities in wealth and health and opportunity that we have gotten used to in this country, and that so much of our politics and ways of doing business seem to take for granted, are just unconscionable. There is no excuse for this kind of inequality in the richest country on earth. What we’re seeing now is a response to that. But it’s a confused and confusing response. Worse, it’s a response that is systematically silencing honest conversation. And this makes it dangerous.</p>
<p>This isn’t just politics and human suffering on display. It’s philosophy. It’s ideas about truth—about what it means to say that something is “true.” What we’re witnessing in our streets and online and in the impossible conversations we’re attempting to have in our private lives is a breakdown in epistemology. How does anyone figure out what’s going on in the world? What is real? If we can’t agree about what is real, or likely to be real, we will never agree about how we should live together. And the problem is, we’re stuck with one other.</p>
<p>So, what’s happening here?</p>
<p>Well, again, it’s hard to say. What is happening when <a href="https://youtu.be/viika57hTO4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a police officer or a mayor takes a knee</a> in front of a crowd of young people who have been berating him for being a cog in the machinery of systemic racism? Is this a profound moment of human bonding that transcends politics, or is it the precursor to the breakdown of society? Or is it both? It’s not entirely clear.</p>
<p>In the most concrete terms, we are experiencing widespread social unrest in response to what is widely believed to be an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at the black community by racist cops and racist policies. And this unrest has drawn a counter-response from law enforcement—much of which, ironically, is guaranteed to exacerbate the problem of police violence, both real and perceived. And many of the videos we’ve seen of the police cracking down on peaceful protesters are hideous. Some of this footage has been unbelievable. And this is one of many vicious circles that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>Again, there is so much to be confused about here. We’ve now seen endless video of police inflicting senseless violence on truly peaceful protesters, and yet we have also seen video of the police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrVp8vlQyU">standing idly by</a> while looters completely destroy businesses. What explains this? Is there a policy that led to this bizarre inversion of priorities? Are the police angry at the protesters for vilifying them, and simultaneously trying to teach society a lesson by letting crime and mayhem spread elsewhere in the city? Or is it just less risky to collide with peaceful protesters? Or is the whole spectacle itself a lie? How representative are these videos of what’s actually going on? Is there much less chaos actually occurring than is being advertised to us?</p>
<p>Again, it’s very hard to know.</p>
<p>What’s easy to know is that civil discourse has broken down. It seems to me that we’ve long been in a situation where the craziest voices on both ends of the political spectrum have been amplifying one another and threatening to produce something truly dangerous. And now I think they have. The amount of misinformation in the air—the degree to which even serious people seem to be ruled by false assumptions and non sequiturs—is just astonishing.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep in mind that, with the presidential election coming in November, the stakes are really high. As most of you know, I consider four more years of Trump to be an existential threat to our democracy. And I believe that the last two weeks have been very good for him, politically, even when everything else seemed to go very badly for him. I know the polls don’t say this. A large majority of people disapprove of his handling this crisis so far. But I think we all know now to take polls with a grain of salt. There is the very real problem of preference falsification—especially in an environment of intense social pressure. People will often say what they think is socially acceptable, and then think, or say, or do something very different in private—like when they’re alone in a voting booth.</p>
<p>Trump has presided over the complete dismantling of American influence in the world and the destruction of our economy. I know the stock market has looked good, but the stock market has become totally uncoupled from the economy. According to the stock market, the future is just as bright now as it was in January of this year, before most of us had even heard of a novel coronavirus. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. And a lot can happen in the next few months. The last two weeks feel like a decade. And my concern is that if Trump now gets to be the law-and-order President, that may be his path to re-election, if such a path exists. Of course, this crisis has revealed, yet again, how unfit he is to be President. The man couldn’t strike a credible note of reconciliation if the fate of the country depended on it—and the fate of the country has depended on it. I also think it’s possible that these protests wouldn’t be happening, but for the fact that Trump is President. Whether or not the problem of racism has gotten worse in our society, having Trump as President surely makes it seem like it has. It has been such a repudiation of the Obama presidency that, for many people, it has made it seem that white supremacy is now ascendant. So, all the more reason to get rid of Trump in November.</p>
<p>But before this social unrest, our focus was on how incompetent Trump was in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. And now he has been given a very different battle to fight. A battle against leftwing orthodoxy, which is growing more stifling by the minute, and civil unrest. If our social order frays sufficiently, restoring it will be the only thing that most people care about in November. Just think of what an act of domestic terrorism would do politically now. Things can change very, very quickly. And to all a concern for basic law and order “racist”, isn’t going to wash.</p>
<p>Trust in institutions has totally broken down. We’ve been under a very precarious quarantine for more than 3 months, which almost the entire medical profession has insisted is necessary. Doctors and public health officials have castigated people on the political Right for protesting this lockdown. People have been unable to be with their loved ones in their last hours of life. They’ve been unable to hold funerals for them. But now we have doctors and public officials by the thousands, signing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letters</a>, making public statements, saying it’s fine to stand shoulder to shoulder with others in the largest protests our nation has ever seen. The degree to which this has undermined confidence in public health messaging is hard to exaggerate. Whatever your politics, this has been just a mortifying piece of hypocrisy. Especially so, because the pandemic has been hitting the African American community hardest of all. How many people will die because of these protests? It’s a totally rational question to ask, but the question itself is taboo now.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that almost everything appears upside down at the moment.</p>
<p>Before I get into details on police violence, first let me try to close the door to a few misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the proximate cause of all this: The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. I’ll have more to say about this in a minute, but nothing I say should detract from the following observation: That <a href="https://youtu.be/vksEJR9EPQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> was absolutely sickening, and it revealed a degree of police negligence and incompetence and callousness that everyone was right to be horrified by. In particular, the actions of Derek Chauvin, the cop who kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes, his actions were so reckless and so likely to cause harm that there’s no question he should be prosecuted. And he is being prosecuted. He’s been indicted for 2nd degree murder and manslaughter, and I suspect he will spend many, many years in prison. And, this is not to say “the system is working.” It certainly seems likely that without the cell phone video, and the public outrage, Chauvin might have gotten away with it—to say nothing of the other cops with him, who are also now being prosecuted. If this is true, we clearly need a better mechanism with which to police the police.</p>
<p>So, as I said, I’ll return to this topic, because I think most people are drawing the wrong conclusions from this video, and from videos like it, but let me just echo everyone’s outrage over what happened. This is precisely the kind of police behavior that everyone should find abhorrent.</p>
<p>On the general topic of racism in America, I want to make a few similarly clear, preemptive statements:</p>
<p>Racism is still a problem in American society. No question. And slavery—which was racism’s most evil expression—was this country’s founding sin. We should also add the near-total eradication of the Native Americans to that ledger of evil. Any morally sane person who learns the details of these historical injustices finds them shocking, whatever their race. And the legacy of these crimes—crimes that were perpetrated for centuries—remains a cause for serious moral concern today. I have no doubt about this. And nothing I’m about to say, should suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>And I don’t think it’s an accident that the two groups I just mentioned, African Americans and Native Americans, suffer the worst from inequality in America today. How could the history of racial discrimination in this country not have had lasting effects, given the nature of that history? And if anything good comes out of the current crisis, it will be that we manage to find a new commitment to reducing inequality in all its dimensions. The real debate to have is about how to do this, economically and politically. But the status quo that many of us take for granted to is a betrayal of our values, whether we realize it or not. If it’s not a betrayal or your values now, it will be a betrayal of your values when you become a better person. And if you don’t manage that, it will be a betrayal of your kid’s values when they’re old enough to understand the world they are living in. The difference between being very lucky in our society, and very unlucky, should not be as enormous as it is.</p>
<p>However, the question that interests me, given what has been true of the past and is now true of the present, is what should we do next? What should we do to build a healthier society?</p>
<p>What should we do next?  Tomorrow… next week…. Obviously, I don’t have the answers. But I am very worried that many of the things we’re doing now, and seem poised to do, will only make our problems worse. And I’m especially worried that it has become so difficult to talk about this. I’m just trying to have conversations. I’m just trying to figure these things out in real time, with other people. And there is no question that conversation itself has become dangerous.</p>
<p>Think about the politics of this. Endless imagery of people burning and looting independent businesses that were struggling to survive, and seeing the owners of these businesses beaten by mobs, cannot be good for the cause of social justice. Looting and burning businesses, and assaulting their owners, isn’t social justice, or even social protest. It’s crime. And having imagery of these crimes that highlight black involvement circulate endlessly on Fox News and on social media cannot be good for the black community. But it might yet be good for Trump.</p>
<p>And it could well kick open the door to a level of authoritarianism that many of us who have been very worried about Trump barely considered possible. It’s always seemed somewhat paranoid to me to wonder whether we’re living in Weimar Germany. I’ve had many conversations about this. I had <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-road-to-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Snyder on the podcast</a>, who’s been worrying about the prospect of tyranny in the US for several years now. I’ve known, in the abstract, that democracies can destroy themselves. But the idea that it could happen here still seemed totally outlandish to me. It doesn’t anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, what we’ve been seeing in the streets isn’t just one thing. Some people are protesting for reasons that I fully defend. They’re outraged by specific instances of police violence, like the killing of George Floyd, and they’re worried about creeping authoritarianism—which we really should be worried about now. And they’re convinced that our politics is broken, because it is broken, and they are deeply concerned that our response to the pandemic and the implosion of our economy will do nothing to address the widening inequality in our society. And they recognize that we have a President who is an incompetent, divisive, conman and a crackpot at a time when we actually need wise leadership.</p>
<p>All of that is hard to put on a sign, but it’s all worth protesting.</p>
<p>However, it seems to me that most protesters are seeing this moment exclusively through the lens of identity politics—and racial politics in particular. And some of them are even celebrating the breakdown of law and order, or at least remaining nonjudgmental about it. And you could see, in the early days of this protest, news anchors take that line, on CNN, for instance. Talking about the history of social protest, “Sometimes it has to be violent, right? What, do you think all of these protests need to be nonviolent?” Those words came out of Chris Cuomo’s mouth, and Don Lemon’s mouth. Many people have been circulating a half quote from Martin Luther King Jr. about riots being “the language of the unheard.” They’re <a href="https://youtu.be/pjYZZC5i_AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving out the part</a> where he made it clear that he believed riots harmed the cause of the black community and helped the cause of racists.</p>
<p>There are now calls to defund and even to abolish the police. This may be psychologically understandable when you’ve spent half your day on Twitter watching videos of cops beating peaceful protesters. Those videos are infuriating. And I’ll have a lot more to say about police violence in a minute. But if you think a society without cops is a society you would want to live in, you have lost your mind. Giving a monopoly on violence to the state is just about the best thing we have ever done as a species. It ranks right up there with keeping our shit out of our food. Having a police force that can deter crime, and solve crimes when they occur, and deliver violent criminals to a functioning justice system, is the necessary precondition for almost anything else of value in society.</p>
<p>We need police reform, of course. There are serious questions to ask about the culture of policing—its hiring practices, training, the militarization of so many police forces, outside oversight, how police departments deal with corruption, the way the police unions keep bad cops on the job, and yes, the problem of racist cops. But the idea that any serious person thinks we can do without the police—or that less trained and less vetted cops will magically be better than more trained and more vetted ones—this just reveals that our conversation on these topics has run completely off the rails. Yes, we should give more resources to community services. We should have psychologists or social workers make first contact with the homeless or the mentally ill. Perhaps we’re giving cops jobs they shouldn’t be doing. All of that makes sense to rethink. But the idea that what we’re witnessing now is a matter of the cops being over-resourced—that we’ve given them too much training, that we’ve made the job too attractive—so that the people we’re recruiting are of too high a quality. That doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>What’s been alarming here is that we’re seeing prominent people—in government, in media, in Hollywood, in sports—speak and act as though the breakdown of civil society, and of society itself, is a form of progress and any desire for law enforcement is itself a form of racist oppression. At one point the woman who’s running the City Council in Minneapolis, which just decided to abolish the police force, was asked by a journalist, I believe on CNN, “What do I do if someone’s breaking into my house in the middle of the night? Who do I call?” And her first response to that question was, “You need to recognize what a statement of privilege that question is.” She’s since had to walk that back, because it’s one of the most galling and embarrassing things a public official has ever said, but this is how close the Democratic Party is to sounding completely insane. You cannot say that if someone is breaking into your house, and you’re terrified, and you want a police force that can respond, that fear is a symptom of “white privilege.” This is where Democratic politics goes to die.</p>
<p>Again, what is alarming about this is that this woke analysis of the breakdown of law and order will only encourage an increasingly authoritarian response, as well as the acceptance of that response by many millions of Americans.</p>
<p>If you step back, you will notice that there is a kind of ecstasy of ideological conformity in the air. And it’s destroying institutions. It’s destroying the very institutions we rely on to get our information—universities, the press. The New York Times in recent days, seems to be preparing for a self-immolation in recent days. No one wants to say or even think anything that makes anyone uncomfortable—certainly not anyone who has more wokeness points than they do. It’s just become too dangerous. There are people <a href="https://wwos.nine.com.au/news/nba-announcer-fired-over-controversial-all-lives-matter-tweet/a9a50198-4b52-4cb7-a800-e0ffacb3302d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being fired</a> for tweeting “All Lives Matter.” #AllLivesMatter, in the current environment, is being read as a naked declaration of white supremacy. That is how weird this moment is. A soccer player on the LA Galaxy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/rowdies/2020/06/05/la-galaxy-releases-player-after-wifes-racist-and-violent-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fired</a> for something his wife tweeted…</p>
<p>Of course, there are real problems of inequality and despair at the bottom of these protests. People who have never found a secure or satisfying place in the world—or young people who fear they never will—people who have seen their economic prospects simply vanish, and people who have had painful encounters with racism and racist cops—people by the millions are now surrendering themselves to a kind of religious awakening. But like most religious awakenings, this movement is not showing itself eager to make honest contact with reality.</p>
<p>On top of that, we find extraordinarily privileged people, whatever the color of their skin—people who have been living wonderful lives in their gated communities or 5<sup>th</sup> avenue apartments—and who feel damn guilty about it—they are supporting this movement uncritically, for many reasons. Of course, they care about other people—I’m sure most of them have the same concerns about inequality that I do—but they are also supporting this movement because it promises a perfect expiation of their sins. If you have millions of dollars, and shoot botox into your face, and vacation on St. Bart’s, and you’re liberal—the easiest way to sleep at night is to be as woke as AOC and like every one of her tweets.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just with the looting, and the arson, and the violence. There are problems with these peaceful protests themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not questioning anyone’s right to protest. Even our deranged president can pay lip service to that right—which he did as the DC police were violently dispersing a peaceful protest so that he could get his picture taken in front of that church, awkwardly holding a bible, as though he had never held a book in life.</p>
<p>The problem with the protests is that they are animated, to a remarkable degree, by confusion and misinformation. And I’ll explain why I think that’s the case. And, of course, this will be controversial. Needless to say, many people will consider the color of my skin to be disqualifying here. I could have invited any number of great, black intellectuals onto the podcast to make these points for me. But that struck me as a form of cowardice. Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Coleman Hughes, Kmele Foster, these guys might not agree with everything I’m about to say, but any one of them could walk the tightrope I’m now stepping out on far more credibly than I can.</p>
<p>But, you see, that’s part of the problem. The perception that the color of a person’s skin, or even his life experience, matters for this discussion is a pernicious illusion. For the discussion we really need to have, the color of a person’s skin, and even his life experience, simply does not matter. It cannot matter. We have to break this spell that the politics of identity has cast over everything.</p>
<p>Ok…</p>
<p>As I’ve already acknowledged, there is a legacy of racism in the United States that we’re still struggling to outgrow. That is obvious. There are real racists out there. And there are ways in which racism became institutionalized long ago. Many of you will remember that during the crack epidemic the penalties for crack and powder cocaine were quite different. And this led black drug offenders to be locked up for much longer than white ones. Now, whether the motivation for that policy was consciously racist or not, I don’t know, but it was effectively racist. Nothing I’m about to say entails a denial of these sorts of facts. There just seems to be no question that boys who grow up with their fathers in prison start life with a significant strike against them. So criminal justice reform is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>And I’m not denying that many black people, perhaps most, have interactions with cops, and others in positions of power, or even random strangers, that seem unambiguously racist. Sometimes this is because they are actually in the presence of racism, and perhaps sometimes it only seems that way. I’ve had unpleasant encounters with cops, and customs officers, and TSA screeners, and bureaucrats of every kind, and even with people working in stores or restaurants. People aren’t always nice or ethical. But being white, and living in a majority white society, I’ve never had to worry about whether any of these collisions were the result of racism. And I can well imagine that in some of these situations, had I been black, I would have come away feeling that I had encountered yet another racist in the wild. So I consider myself very lucky to have gone through life not having to think about any of that. Surely that’s one form of white privilege.</p>
<p>So, nothing I’m going to say denies that we should condemn racism—whether interpersonal or institutional—and we should condemn it wherever we find it. But as a society, we simply can’t afford to find and condemn racism where it doesn’t exist. And we should be increasingly aware of the costs of doing that. The more progress we make on issues of race, the less racism there will be to find, and the more likely we’ll find ourselves chasing after its ghost.</p>
<p>The truth is, we have made considerable progress on the problem of racism in America. This isn’t 1920, and it isn’t 1960. We had a two-term black president. We have black congressmen and women. We have black mayors and black chiefs of police. There are major cities, like Detroit and Atlanta, going on their fifth or sixth consecutive black mayor. Having more and more black people in positions of real power, in what is still a majority white society, is progress on the problem of racism. And the truth is, it might not even solve the problem we’re talking about. When Freddy Gray was killed in Baltimore, virtually everyone who could have been held accountable for his death was black. The problem of police misconduct and reform is complicated, as we’re about to see. But obviously, there is more work to do on the problem of racism. And, more important, there is much more work to do to remedy the inequalities in our society that are so correlated with race, and will still be correlated with race, even after the last racist has been driven from our shores.</p>
<p>The question of how much of today’s inequality is due to existing racism—whether racist people or racist policies—is a genuinely difficult question to answer. And to answer it, we need to distinguish the past from the present.</p>
<p>Take wealth inequality, for example: The median white family has a net worth of around $170,000—these data are a couple of years old, but they’re probably pretty close to what’s true now. The median black family has a net worth of around $17,000. So we have a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/06/18/a-conversation-about-the-racial-wealth-gap-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenfold difference in median wealth</a>. (That’s the median, not the mean: Half of white families are below 170,000 and half above; half of black families are below 17,000 and half above. And we’re talking about wealth here, not income.)</p>
<p>This disparity in wealth persists even for people whose incomes are in the top 10 percent of the income distribution. For whites in the top 10 percent for income, the median net worth is $1.8 million; for blacks it’s around $350,000. There are probably many things that account for this disparity in wealth. It seems that black families that make it to the top of the income distribution fall out of it more easily than white families do. But it’s also undeniable that black families have less intergenerational wealth accumulated through inheritance.</p>
<p>How much of this is inequality due to the legacy of slavery? And how much of it is due to an ensuing century of racist policies? I’m prepared to believe quite a lot. And it strikes me as totally legitimate to think about paying reparations as a possible remedy here. Of course, one will then need to talk about reparations for the Native Americans. And then one wonders where this all ends. And what about blacks who aren’t descended from slaves, but who still suffered the consequences of racism in the US? In listening to people like <a href="https://youtu.be/FXt9Q5h1sCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McWhorter</a> and Coleman Hughes discuss this topic, I’m inclined to think that reparations is probably unworkable as a policy. But the truth is that I’m genuinely unsure about this.</p>
<p>Whatever we decide about the specific burdens of the past, we have to ask, how much of current wealth inequality is due to existing racism and to existing policies that make it harder for black families to build wealth? And the only way to get answers to those questions is to have a dispassionate discussion about facts.</p>
<p>The problem with the social activism we are now seeing—what John McWhorter has called “the new religion of anti-Racism”—is that it finds racism nearly everywhere, even where it manifestly does not exist. And this is incredibly damaging to the cause of achieving real equality in our society. It’s almost impossible to exaggerate the evil and injustice of slavery and its aftermath. But it is possible to exaggerate how much racism currently exists at an Ivy League university, or in Silicon Valley, or at the Oscars. And those exaggerations are toxic—and, perversely, they may produce more real racism. It seems to me that false claims of victimhood can diminish the social stature of any group, even a group that has a long history of real victimization.</p>
<p>The imprecision here—the bad-faith arguments, the double standards, the goal-post shifting, the <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hrFzz1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idiotic opinion pieces</a> in the New York Times, the defenestrations on social media, the general hysteria that the cult of wokeness has produced—I think this is all extremely harmful to civil society, and to effective liberal politics, and to the welfare of African Americans.</p>
<p>So, with that as preamble, let’s return to the tragic death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>As I said, I believe that any sane person who watches that video will feel that they have witnessed a totally unjustified killing. So, people of any race, are right to be horrified by what happened there. But now I want to ask a few questions, and I want us to try to consider them dispassionately. And I really want you to watch your mind while you do this. There are very likely to be few tripwires installed there, and I’m about to hit them. So just do your best to remain calm.</p>
<p>Does the killing of George Floyd prove that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>Does it even suggest that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>In other words, do we have reason to believe that, had Floyd been white, he wouldn’t have died in a similar way?</p>
<p>Do the dozen or so other videos that have emerged in recent years, of black men being killed by cops, do they prove, or even suggest, that there is an epidemic of lethal police violence directed especially at black men and that this violence is motivated by racism?</p>
<p>Most people seem to think that the answers to these questions are so obvious that to even pose them as I just did is obscene. The answer is YES, and it’s a yes that now needs to be shouted in the streets.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that if you take even 5 minutes to look at the data on crime and police violence, the answer appears to be “no,” in every case, albeit with one important caveat. I’m not talking about how the police behaved in 1970 or even 1990. But in the last 25 years, violent crime has come down significantly in the US, and so has the police use of deadly force. And as you’re about to see, the police used more deadly force against white people—both in absolute numbers, and in terms of their contribution to crime and violence in our society. But the public perception is, of course, completely different.</p>
<p>In a city like Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-12/lapd-use-of-force-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 was a 30-year low</a> for police shootings. Think about that…. Do the people who were protesting in Los Angeles, peacefully and violently, do the people who were ransacking and burning businesses by the hundreds—in many cases, businesses that will not return to their neighborhoods—do the people who caused so much damage to the city, that certain neighborhoods, ironically the neighborhoods that are disproportionately black, will take years, probably decades to recover, do the celebrities who supported them, and even bailed them out of jail—do any of these people know that 2019 was the 30-year low for police shootings in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Before I step out further over the abyss here, let me reiterate: Many of you are going to feel a visceral negative reaction to what I’m about to say. You’re not going to like the way it sounds. You’re especially not going to like the way it sounds coming from a white guy. This feeling of not liking, this feeling of outrage, this feeling of disgust—this feeling of “Sam, what the fuck is wrong with you, why are you even touching this topic?”—this feeling isn’t an argument. It isn’t, or shouldn’t be, the basis for your believing anything to be true or false about the world.</p>
<p>Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that I or anyone else needs to respect. Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that you should respect. In fact, it is something that you should be on your guard for. Perhaps more than any other property of your mind, this feeling can mislead you.</p>
<p>If you care about justice—and you absolutely should—you should care about facts and the ability to discuss them openly. Justice requires contact with reality. It simply isn’t the case—it cannot be the case—that the most pressing claims on our sense of justice need come from those who claim to be the most offended by conversation itself.</p>
<p>So, I’m going to speak the language of facts right now, in so far as we know them, all the while knowing that these facts run very much counter to most people’s assumptions. Many of the things you think you know about crime and violence in our society are almost certainly wrong. And that should matter to you.</p>
<p>So just take a moment and think this through with me.</p>
<p>How many people are killed each year in America by cops? If you don’t know, guess. See if you have any intuitions for these numbers. Because your intuitions are determining how you interpret horrific videos of the sort we saw coming out of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The answer for many years running is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 1000</a>. One thousand people are killed by cops in America each year. There are about 50 to 60 million encounters between civilians and cops each year, and <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 10 million arrests</a>. That’s down from a high of over 14 million arrests annually throughout the 1990’s. So, of the 10 million occasions where a person attracts the attention of the police, and the police decide to make an arrest, about 1000 of those people die as a result. (I’m sure a few people get killed even when no arrest was attempted, but that has to be a truly tiny number.) So, without knowing anything else about the situation, if the cops decide to arrest you, it would be reasonable to think that your chance of dying is around 1/10,000. Of course, in the United States, it’s higher than it is in other countries. So I’m not saying that this number is acceptable. But it is what it is for a reason, as we’re about to see.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few generic things I’d like to point here before we get further into the data. They should be uncontroversial.</p>
<p>First, it’s almost certainly the case that of these 1000 officer-caused deaths each year, some are entirely justified—it may even be true that most are entirely justified—and some are entirely unjustified, and some are much harder to judge. And that will be true next year. And the year after that.</p>
<p>Of the unjustified killings, there are vast differences between them. Many have nothing in common but for the fact that a cop killed someone unnecessarily. It might have been a terrible misunderstanding, or incompetence, or just bad luck, and in certain cases it could be a cop who decides to murder someone because he’s become enraged, or he’s just a psychopath. And it is certainly possible that racial bias accounts for some number of these unjustified killings.</p>
<p>Another point that should be uncontroversial—but may sound a little tone-deaf in the current environment, where we’ve inundated with videos of police violence in response to these protests. But this has to be acknowledged whenever we’re discussing this topic: Cops have a very hard job. In fact, in the current environment, they have an almost impossible job.</p>
<p>If you’re making 10 million arrests every year, some number of people will decide not to cooperate. There can be many reasons for this. A person could be mentally ill, or drunk, or on drugs. Of course, rather often the person is an actual criminal who doesn’t want to be arrested.</p>
<p>Among innocent people, and perhaps this getting more common these days, a person might feel that resisting arrest is the right thing to do, ethically or politically or as a matter of affirming his identity. After all, put yourself in his shoes, he did nothing wrong. Why are the cops arresting him? I don’t know if we have data on the numbers of people who resist arrest by race. But I can well imagine that if it’s common for African Americans to believe that the only reason they have been singled out for arrest is due to racism on the part of the police, that could lead to greater levels of non-compliance. Which seems very likely to lead to more unnecessary injury and death. This is certainly one reason why it is wise to have the racial composition of a police force mirror that of the community it’s policing. Unfortunately, there’s no evidence that this will reduce lethal violence from the side of the police. In fact, the evidence we have suggests that black and Hispanic cops are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. But it would surely change the perception of the community that racism is a likely explanation for police behavior, which itself might reduce conflict.</p>
<p>When a cop goes hands on a person in an attempt to control his movements or make an arrest, that person’s resistance poses a problem that most people don’t understand. If you haven’t studied this topic. If you don’t know what it physically takes to restrain and immobilize a non-compliant person who may be bigger and stronger than you are, and if you haven’t thought through the implications of having a gun on your belt while attempting to do that—a gun that can be grabbed and used against you, or against a member of the public—then your intuitions about what makes sense here, tactically and ethically, are very likely to be bad.</p>
<p>If you haven’t trained with firearms under stress. If you don’t know how suddenly situations can change. If you haven’t experienced how quickly another person can close the distance on you, and how little time you have to decide to draw your weapon. If you don’t know how hard it is to shoot a moving target, or even a stationary one, when your heart is beating out of your chest. You very likely have totally unreasonable ideas about what we can expect from cops in situations like these. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwWado4SVY&amp;bpctr=1592453276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbOLb0O7Pw&amp;bpctr=1592455027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_87GBOCVYTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]</p>
<p>And there is another fact that looms over all this like the angel of Death, literally: Most cops do not get the training they need. They don’t get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQLOmfx8X_E&amp;feature=emb_title">hand-to-hand training</a> they need—they don’t have good skills to subdue people without harming them. All you need to do is watch YouTube videos of botched arrests to see this. The martial arts community stands in perpetual astonishment at <a href="https://youtu.be/F4VeHOkt_o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kinds of things cops do and fail to do</a> once they start fighting with suspects. Cops also don’t get the firearms training they need. Of course, there are elite units in many police departments, but most cops do not have the training they need to do the job they’re being asked to do.</p>
<p>It is also true, no doubt, that some cops are racist bullies. And there are corrupt police departments that cover for these guys, and cover up police misconduct generally, whether it was borne of racism or not.</p>
<p>But the truth is that even if we got rid of all bad cops, which we absolutely should do, and there were only good people left, and we got all these good people the best possible training, and we gave them the best culture in which to think about their role in society, and we gave them the best methods for de-escalating potentially violent situations—which we absolutely must do—and we scrubbed all the dumb laws from our books, so that when cops were required to enforce the law, they were only risking their lives and the lives of civilians for reasons that we deem necessary and just—so the war on drugs is obviously over—even under these conditions of perfect progress, we are still guaranteed to have some number of cases each year where a cop kills a civilian in a way that is totally unjustified, and therefore tragic. Every year, there will be some number of families who will be able to say that the cops killed their son or daughter, or father or mother, or brother or sister. And videos of these killings will occasionally surface, and they will be horrific. This seems guaranteed to happen.</p>
<p>So, while we need to make all these improvements, we still need to understand that there are very likely always to going to be videos of cops doing something inexplicable, or inexplicably stupid, that results in an innocent person’s death, or a not-so-innocent person’s death. And sometimes the cop will be white and the victim will be black. We have 10 million arrests each year. And we now live in a panopticon where practically everything is videotaped.</p>
<p>I’m about to get further into the details of what we know about police violence, but I want to just put it to you now: If we’re going to let the health of race relations in this country, or the relationship between the community and the police, depend on whether we ever see a terrible video of police misconduct again, the project of healing these wounds in our society is doomed.</p>
<p>About a week into these protests I heard Van Jones on CNN say, “If we see one more video of a cop brutalizing a black man, this country could go over the edge.” He said this, not as indication of how dangerously inflamed people have become. He seemed to be saying it as an ultimatum to the police. With 10 million arrests a year, arrests that have to take place in the most highly armed society in the developed world, I hope you understand how unreasonable that ultimatum is.</p>
<p>We have to put these videos into context. And we have to acknowledge how different they are from one another. Some of them are easy to interpret. But some are quite obviously being interpreted incorrectly by most people—especially by activists. And there are a range of cases—some have video associated with them and some don’t—that are now part of a litany of anti-racist outrage, and the names of the dead are intoned as though they were all evidence of the same injustice. And yet, they are not.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XKQqgVlk0NQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Scott</a> was stopped for a broken taillight and got out of his car and tried to flee. There might have been a brief struggle over the officer’s taser, that part of the video isn’t clear. But what is clear is that he was shot in the back multiple times as he was running away. That was insane. There was zero reason for the officer to feel that his life was under threat at the point he opened fire. And for that unjustified shooting, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. I’m not sure that’s long enough. That seemed like straight-up murder.</p>
<p>The George Floyd video, while even more disturbing to watch, is harder to interpret. I don’t know anything about Derek Chauvin, the cop who knelt on his neck. It’s quite possible that he’s a terrible person who should have never been a cop. He seems to have a significant number of complaints against him—though, as far as I know, the details of those complaints haven’t been released. And he might be a racist on top of being a bad cop. Or he might be a guy who was totally in over his head and thought you could restrain someone indefinitely by keeping a knee on their neck indefinitely. I don’t know. I’m sure more facts will come out. But whoever he is, I find it very unlikely that he was intending to kill George Floyd. Think about it. He was surrounded by irate witnesses and being filmed. Unless he was aspiring to become the most notorious murderer in human history, it seems very unlikely that he was intending to commit murder in that moment. It’s possible, of course. But it doesn’t seem the likeliest explanation for his behavior.</p>
<p>What I believe we saw on that video was the result of a tragic level of negligence and poor training on the part of those cops. Or terrible recruitment—it’s possible that none of these guys should have ever been cops. I think for one of them, it was only his fourth day on the job. Just imagine that. Just imagine all things you don’t know as a new cop.  It could also be a function of bad luck in terms of Floyd’s underlying health. It’s been reported that he was complaining of being unable to breath before Chauvin pinned him with his knee. The knee on his neck might not have been the only thing that caused his death. It could have also been the weight of the other officer pinning him down.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly what happened in the cast of Eric Garner. Half the people on earth believe they witnessed a cop choke Eric Garner to death in that video. That does not appear to be what happened. When Eric Garner is saying “I can’t breathe” he’s not being choked. He’s being held down on the pavement by several officers. Being forced down on your stomach under the weight of several people can kill a person, especially someone with lung or heart disease. In the case of Eric Garner, it is absolutely clear that the cop who briefly attempted to choke him was no longer choking him. If you doubt that, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/Nql1xRtWKOU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> again.</p>
<p>And if you are recoiling now from my interpretation of these videos, you really should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_c-E_i8Q5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the killing of Tony Timpa</a>. It’s also terribly disturbing, but it removes the variable of race and it removes any implication of intent to harm on the part of the cops about as clearly as you could ask. It really is worth watching as a corrective to our natural interpretation of these other videos.</p>
<p>Tony Timpa was a white man in Dallas, who was suffering some mental health emergency and cocaine intoxication. And he actually called 911 himself. What we see is the bodycam footage from the police, which shows that he was already in handcuffs when they arrived—a security guard had cuffed him. And then the cops take over, and they restrain Timpa on the ground, by rolling him onto a stomach and putting their weight on him, very much like in the case of Eric Garner. And they keep their weight on him—one cop has a knee on his upper back, which is definitely much less aggressive than a knee on the neck—but they crush the life out of him all the same, over the course of 13 minutes. He’s not being choked. The cops are not being rough. There’s no animus between them and Timpa. It was not a hostile arrest. They clearly believe that they’re responding to a mental health emergency. But they keep him down on his belly, under their weight, and they’re cracking jokes as he loses consciousness. Now, your knowledge that he’s going to be dead by the end of this video, make their jokes seem pretty callous. But this was about as benign an imposition of force by cops as you’re going to see. The crucial insight you will have watching this video, is that the officers not only had no intent to kill Tony Timpa, they don’t take his pleading seriously because they have no doubt that what they’re doing is perfectly safe—perfectly within protocol. They’ve probably done this hundreds of times before.</p>
<p>If you watch that video—and, again, fair warning, it is disturbing—but imagine how disturbing it would have been to our society if Tony Timpa had been black. If the only thing you changed about the video was the color of Timpa’s skin, then that video would have detonated like a nuclear bomb in our society, exactly as the George Floyd video did. In fact, in one way it is worse, or would have been perceived to be worse. I mean, just imagine white cops telling jokes as they crushed the life out of a black Tony Timpa… Given the nature of our conversation about violence, given the way we perceive videos of this kind, there is no way that people would have seen that as anything other than a lynching. And yet, it would not have been a lynching.</p>
<p>Now, I obviously have no idea what was in the minds of cops in Minneapolis. And perhaps we’ll learn at trial. Perhaps a tape of Chauvin using the N-word in another context will surface, bringing in a credible allegation of racism. It seems to me that Chauvin is going to have a very hard time making sense of his actions. But most people who saw that video believe they have seen, with their own eyes, beyond any possibility of doubt, a racist cop intentionally murder an innocent man. That’s not what the video necessarily shows.</p>
<p>As I said, these videos can be hard to interpret, even while seeming very easy to interpret. And these cases, whether we have associated video or not, are very different. Michael Brown is reported to have punched a cop in the face and attempted to get his gun. As far as I know, there’s no video of that encounter. But, if true, that is an entirely different situation. If you’re attacking a cop, trying to get his gun, that is a life and death struggle that almost by definition for the cop, and it most cases justifies the use of lethal force. And honestly, it seems that no one within a thousand miles of Black Lives Matter is willing to make these distinctions. An attitude of anti-racist moral outrage is not the best lens through which to interpret evidence of police misconduct.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many videos of people getting arrested. And I’ve seen the outraged public reaction to what appears to be inappropriate use of force by the cops. One overwhelming fact that comes through is that people, whatever the color of their skin, don’t understand how to behave around cops so as to keep themselves safe. People have to stop resisting arrest. This may seem obvious, but judging from most of these videos, and from the public reaction to them, this must be a totally arcane piece of information. When a cop wants to take you into custody, you don’t get to decide whether or not you should be arrested. When a cop wants to take you into custody, for whatever reason, it’s not a negotiation. And if you turn it into a wrestling match, you’re very likely to get injured or killed.</p>
<p>This is a point I once belabored in a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/racism-and-violence-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast with Glenn Loury</a>, and it became essentially a public service announcement. And I’ve gone back and listened to those comments, and I want to repeat them here. This is something that everyone really needs to understand. And it’s something that Black Lives Matter should be teaching explicitly: If you put your hands on a cop—if you start wrestling with a cop, or grabbing him because he’s arresting your friend, or pushing him, or striking him, or using your hands in way that can possibly be interpreted as your reaching for a gun—you are likely to get shot in the United States, whatever the color of your skin.</p>
<p>As I said, when you’re with a cop, there is always a gun out in the open. And any physical struggle has to be perceived by him as a fight for the gun. A cop doesn’t know what you’re going to do if you overpower him, so he has to assume the worst. Most cops are not confident in their ability to physically control a person without shooting him—for good reason, because they’re not well trained to do that, and they’re continually confronting people who are bigger, or younger, or more athletic, or more aggressive than they are. Cops are not superheroes. They’re ordinary people with insufficient training, and once things turn physical they cannot afford to give a person who is now assaulting a police officer the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>This is something that most people seem totally confused about. If they see a video of somebody trying to punch a cop in the face and the person’s unarmed, many people think the cop should just punch back, and any use of deadly force would be totally disproportionate. But that’s not how violence works. It’s not the cop’s job to be the best bare-knuckled boxer on Earth so he doesn’t have to use his gun. A cop can’t risk getting repeatedly hit in the face and knocked out, because there’s always a gun in play. This is the cop’s perception of the world, and it’s a justifiable one, given the dynamics of human violence.</p>
<p>You might think cops shouldn’t carry guns. Why can’t we just be like England? That’s a point that can be debated. But it requires considerable thought in a country where there are over 300 million guns on the street. The United States is not England.</p>
<p>Again, really focus on what is happening when a cop is attempting to arrest a person. It’s not up to you to decide whether or not you should be arrested. Does it matter that you know you didn’t do anything wrong? No. And how could that fact be effectively communicated in the moment by your not following police commands? I’m going to ask that again: How could the fact that you’re innocent, that you’re not a threat to cop, that you’re not about to suddenly attack him or produce a weapon of your own, how could those things be effectively communicated at the moment he’s attempting to arrest you by your resisting arrest?</p>
<p>Unless you called the cops yourself, you never know what situation you’re in. If I’m walking down the street, I don’t know if the cop who is approaching me didn’t get a call that some guy who looks like Ben Stiller just committed an armed robbery. I know I didn’t do anything, but I don’t know what’s in the cop’s head. The time to find out what’s going on—the time to complain about racist cops, the time to yell at them and tell them they’re all going to get fired for their stupidity and misconduct—is after cooperating, at the police station, in the presence of a lawyer, preferably. But to not comply in the heat of the moment, when a guy with the gun is issuing commands—this raises your risk astronomically, and it’s something that most people, it seems, just do not intuitively understand, even when they’re not in the heat of the moment themselves, but just watching video of other people getting arrested.</p>
<p>Ok. End of public-service announcement.</p>
<p>The main problem with using individual cases, where black men and women have been killed by cops, to conclude that there is an epidemic of racist police violence in our society, is that you can find nearly identical cases of white suspects being killed by cops, and there are actually more of them.</p>
<p>In 2016, John McWhorter wrote a <a href="https://time.com/4404987/police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> in Time Magazine about this.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of what he wrote:</p>
<p>“The heart of the indignation over these murders is a conviction that racist bias plays a decisive part in these encounters. That has seemed plausible to me, and I have recently challenged those who disagree to present a list of white people killed within the past few years under circumstances similar to those that so enrage us in cases such as what happened to Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Walter Scott, Sam Debose, and others.”</p>
<p>So, McWhorter issued that challenge, as he said, and he was presented with the cases [<a href="https://youtu.be/EPxNUKw0kV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/VBUUx0jUKxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6KhRcIOuurI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]. But there’s no song about these people, admonishing us to say their names. And the list of white names is longer, and I don’t know any of them, other than Tony Timpa. I know the black names. In addition to the ones I just read from McWhorter’s article, I know the names of Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, and Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile, and now, of course, I know the name of George Floyd. And I’m aware of many of the details of these cases where black men and women have been killed by cops. I know the name of Breonna Taylor. I can’t name a single white person killed by cops in circumstances like these—other than Timpa—and I just read McWhorter’s article where he lists many of them.</p>
<p>So, this is also a distortion in the media. The media is not showing us videos of white people being killed by cops; activists are not demanding that they do this. I’m sure white supremacists talk about this stuff a lot, who knows? But in terms of the story we’re telling ourselves in the mainstream, we are not actually talking about the data on lethal police violence.</p>
<p>So back to the data: Again, cops kill around 1000 people every year in the United States. About 25 percent are black. About 50 percent are white. The data on police homicide are all over the place. The federal government does not have a single repository for data of this kind. But they have been pretty carefully tracked by outside sources, like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, for the last 5 years. These ratios appear stable over time. Again, many of these killings are justifiable, we’re talking about career criminals who are often armed and, in many cases, trying to kill the cops. Those aren’t the cases we’re worried about. We’re worried about the unjustifiable homicides.</p>
<p>Now, some people will think that these numbers still represent an outrageous injustice. Afterall, African Americans are only 13 percent of the population. So, at most, they should be 13 percent of the victims of police violence, not 25 percent. Any departure from the baseline population must be due to racism.</p>
<p>Ok. Well, that sounds plausible, but consider a few more facts:</p>
<p>Blacks are 13 percent of the population, but they commit <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 50 percent</a> of the murders and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883">other violent crimes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have 13 percent of the population responsible for 50 percent of the murders—and in some cities committing 2/3rds of all violent crime—what percent of police attention should it attract? I don’t know. But I’m pretty sure it’s not just 13 percent. Given that the overwhelming majority of their victims are black, I’m pretty sure that most black people wouldn’t set the dial at 13 percent either.</p>
<p>And here we arrive at the core of the problem. The story of crime in America is overwhelmingly the story of black-on-black crime. It is also, in part, a story of black-on-white crime. For more than a generation, crime in America really hasn’t been a story of much white-on-black crime. [Some listeners mistook my meaning here. I’m not denying that most violent crime is intraracial. So, it’s true that most white homicide victims are killed by white offenders. Per capita, however, the white crime rate is much lower than the black crime rate. And there is more black-on-white crime than white-on-black crime.—SH]</p>
<p>The murder rate has come down steadily since the early 1990’s, with only minor upticks. But, nationwide, blacks are still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 times more likely</a> to get murdered than whites, and in some cities their risk is double that. And <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/wiener/programs/pcj/files/PoliceandPublicDiscourseBlackonBlackViolence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 95 percent</a> of the murders are committed by members of the African American community. [While reported in 2015, these data were more than a decade old. Looking at more recent data from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI’s Uniform Crime Report</a>, the number appears to be closer to 90 percent.—SH]</p>
<p>The weekend these protests and riots were kicking off nationwide—when our entire country seemed to be tearing itself apart over a perceived epidemic of racist police violence against the black community, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-sees-18-homicides-deadliest-day-60-years/story?id=71150234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">92 people were shot, and 27 killed</a>, in Chicago alone—one city. This is almost entirely a story of black men killing members of their own community. And this is far more representative of the kind of violence that the black community needs to worry about. And, ironically, it’s clear that one remedy for this violence is, or would be, effective policing.</p>
<p>These are simply the facts of crime in our society as we best understand them. And the police have to figure out how to respond to these facts, professionally and ethically. The question is, are they doing that? And, obviously, there’s considerable doubt that they’re doing that, professionally and ethically.</p>
<p>Roland Fryer, the Harvard economist who’s work I discussed on the podcast with Glenn Loury, studied police encounters involving black and white suspects and the use of force.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> is titled, this from 2016, “An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force.”</p>
<p>Fryer is black, and he went into this research with the expectation that the data would confirm that there’s an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at black men. But he didn’t find that. However, he did find support for the suspicion that black people suffer more nonlethal violence at the hands of cops than whites do.</p>
<p>So let’s look at this.</p>
<p>The study examined data from 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida and California. Generally, Fryer found that there is 25 percent greater likelihood that the police would go hands on black suspects than white ones—cuffing them, or forcing them to ground, or using other non-lethal force.</p>
<p>Specifically, in New York City, in encounters where white and black citizens were matched for other characteristics, they found that:</p>
<p>Cops were…</p>
<ul>
<li>17 percent more likely to go hands on black suspects</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them into a wall</li>
<li>16 percent more likely to put them in handcuffs (in a situation in which they aren’t arrested)</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them to the ground</li>
<li>25 percent more likely to use pepper spray or a baton</li>
<li>19 percent more likely to draw their guns</li>
<li>24 percent more likely to point a gun at them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more or less the full continuum of violence short of using lethal force. And it seems, from the data we have, that blacks receive more of it than whites. What accounts for this disparity? Racism? Maybe. However, as I said, it’s inconvenient to note that other data suggest that black cops and Hispanic cops are more likely to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. I’m not sure how an ambient level of racism explains that.</p>
<p>Are there other explanations? Well, again, could it be that blacks are less cooperative with the police. If so, that’s worth understanding. A culture of resisting arrest would be a very bad thing to cultivate, given that the only response to such resistance is for the police to increase their use of force.</p>
<p>Whatever is true here is something we should want to understand. And it’s all too easy to see how an increased number of encounters with cops, due to their policing in the highest crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black, and an increased number of traffic stops in those neighborhoods, and an increased propensity for cops to go hands-on these suspects, with or without an arrest, for whatever reason—it’s easy to see how all of this could be the basis for a perception of racism, whether or not racism is the underlying motivation.</p>
<p>It is totally humiliating to be arrested or manhandled by a cop. And, given the level of crime in the black community, a disproportionate number of innocent black men seem guaranteed to have this experience. It’s totally understandable that this would make them bitter and mistrustful of the police. This is another vicious circle that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>But Fryer also found that black suspects are around 25 percent less likely to be shot than white suspects are. And in the most egregious situations, where officers were not first attacked, but nevertheless fired their weapons at a suspect, they were more likely to do this when the suspect was white.</p>
<p>Again, the data are incomplete. This doesn’t not cover every city in the country. And a larger study tomorrow might paint a different picture. But, as far as I know, the best data we have suggest that for, whatever reason, whites are more likely to be killed by cops once an arrest is attempted. And a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more recent study</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  by David Johnson and colleagues found similar results. And it is simply undeniable that more whites are killed by cops each year, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to their contributions to crime and violence in our society.</p>
<p>Can you hear how these facts should be grinding in that well-oiled machine of woke outrage? Our society is in serious trouble now. We are being crushed under the weight of a global pandemic and our response to it has been totally inept. On top of that, we’re being squeezed by the growing pressure of what might become a full-on economic depression. And the streets are now filled with people who imagine, on the basis of seeing some horrific videos, that there is an epidemic of racist cops murdering African Americans. Look at what this belief is doing to our politics. And these videos will keep coming. And the truth is they could probably be matched 2 for 1 with videos of white people being killed by cops. What percentage of people protesting understand that the disparity runs this way? In light of the belief that the disparity must run the other way, people are now quite happy to risk getting beaten and arrested by cops themselves, and to even loot and burn businesses. And most people and institutions are supporting this civil unrest from the sidelines, because they too imagine that cops are killing black people in extraordinary numbers. And all of this is calling forth an authoritarian response from Trump—and leading to more examples of police violence caught on video.</p>
<p>As I hope I’ve made clear, we need police reform—there’s no question about this. And some of the recent footage of the police attacking peaceful protests is outrageous. Nothing I just said should signify that I’m unaware of that. From what I’ve seen—and by the time I release this podcast, the character of all this might have changed—but, from what I’ve seen, the police were dangerously passive in the face of looting and real crime, at least in the beginning. In many cities, they just stood and watched society unravel. And then they were far too aggressive in the face of genuinely peaceful protests. This is a terrible combination. It is the worst combination. There’s no better way to increase cynicism and anger and fear, on all sides.</p>
<p>But racializing how we speak about the problem of police violence, where race isn’t actually the relevant variable—again, think of Tony Timpa— this has highly negative effects. First, it keeps us from talking about the real problems with police tactics. For instance, we had the recent case of Breonna Taylor who was killed in a so-called “no knock” raid of her home. As occasionally happens, in this carnival of moral error we call “the war on drugs,” the police had the wrong address, and they kicked in the wrong door. And they wound up killing a totally innocent woman. But this had nothing to do with race. The problem is not, as some commentators have alleged, that it’s not safe to be “sleeping while black.” The problem is that these no-knock raids are an obscenely dangerous way of enforcing despicably stupid laws. White people die under precisely these same circumstances, and very likely in greater numbers (I don’t have data specifically on no-knock raids, but we can assume that the ratio is probably conserved here).</p>
<p>Think about how crazy this policy is in a nation where gun ownership is so widespread. If someone kicks in your door in the middle of the night, and you’re a gun owner, of course you’re going to reach for your gun. That’s why you have a gun in the first place. The fact that people bearing down on you and your family out of the darkness might have yelled “police” (or might have not yelled “police”; it’s alleged in some of these cases that they don’t yell anything)—the fact that someone yells “police” isn’t necessarily convincing. Anyone can yell “police.” And, again, think of the psychology of this: If the police have the wrong house, and you know there is no reason on earth that real cops would take an interest in you, especially in the middle of the night, because you haven’t done anything (you’re not the guy running a meth lab)—and now you’re reaching for your gun in the dark—of course, someone is likely to get killed. This is not a racial issue. It’s a terrible policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process of police reform isn’t straightforward—and it is made massively more complicated by what’s happening now. Yes, we will be urging police reform in a very big way now, that much seems clear. But Roland Fryer <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also shown</a> that investigations of the cops, in a climate where viral videos and racial politics are operating, have dramatic effects, many of which are negative.</p>
<p>He studied the aftermath of the investigations into police misconduct that followed the killings Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, and Lequan McDonald, and found that, for reasons that seem pretty easy to intuit, proactive police contact with civilians decreases drastically, sometimes by as much 100 percent, once these investigations get started. This is now called “The Ferguson Effect.” The police still answer 911 calls, but they don’t investigate suspicious activity in the same way. They don’t want to wind up on YouTube. And when they alter their behavior like this, homicides go up. Fryer estimates that the effects of these few investigations translated into 1000 extra homicides, and almost 40,000 more felonies, over the next 24 months in the US. And, of course, most of the victims of those crimes were black. One shudders to imagine the size of the Ferguson effect we’re about to see nationwide… I’m sure the morale among cops has never been lower. I think it’s almost guaranteed that cops by the thousands will be leaving the force. And it will be much more difficult to recruit good people.</p>
<p>Who is going to want to be a cop now? Who could be idealist about occupying that role in society? It seems to me that the population of people who will become cops now will be more or less indistinguishable from the population of people who become prison guards. I’m pretty sure there’s a difference there, and I think we’re likely to see that difference expressed in the future. It’s a grim picture, unless we do something very creative here.</p>
<p>So there’s a real question about how we can reform police departments, and get rid of bad cops, without negatively impacting the performance of good cops? That’s a riddle we have to solve—or at least we have to understand what the trade-offs are here.</p>
<p>Why is all of this happening now? Police killings of civilians have gone way down. And they are rare events. They are 1/10,000 level events, if measured by arrests. 1/50-60,000 level events if measured by police encounters. And the number of unarmed people who are killed is smaller still. Around 50 last year, again, more were white than black. And not all unarmed victims are innocent. Some get killed in the act of attacking the cops.  [<a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/05/19/breaking-officer-involved-shooting-in-buckingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/officer-involved-shooting-in-adair-county-oklahoma/527-e8cdc435-dcd0-429c-962f-b2c82c22068e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article36802032.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>]</p>
<p>Again, the data don’t tell a clean story, or the whole story. I see no reason to doubt that blacks get more attention from the cops—though, honestly, given the distribution of crime in our society, I don’t know what the alternative to that would be. And once the cops get involved, blacks are more likely to get roughed up, which is bad. But, again, it simply isn’t clear that racism is the cause. And contrary to everyone’s expectations, whites seem more likely to get killed by cops. Actually, one factor seems to be that whites are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 times more likely</a> to commit “suicide by cop” (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 times more likely</a> to commit suicide generally). What’s going on there? Who knows?</p>
<p>There’s a lot we don’t understand about these data. But ask yourself, would our society seem less racist if the disparity ran the other way? Is less physical contact, but a greater likelihood of getting shot and killed a form of white privilege? Is a higher level of suicide by cop, and suicide generally, a form of white privilege? We have a problem here that, read either way, you can tell a starkly racist narrative.</p>
<p>We need ethical, professional policing, of course. But the places with the highest crime in our society need the most of it. Is there any doubt about that? In a city like Milwaukee, blacks are 12 times more likely to get murdered than whites [Not sure where I came by this number, probably a lecture or podcast. It appears the rate is closer to <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/01/12/gun-homicides-milwaukee-has-two-thirds-of-states-gun-killings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 times more likely</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/07/13/residential-segregation-associated-with-black-white-disparity-in-firearm-homicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 times more likely</a> in Wisconsin as a whole—SH], again, they are being killed by other African Americans, nearly 100 percent of the time. I think the lowest figure I’ve seen is 93 percent of the time. [As noted above, more recent data suggest that it’s closer to 90 percent]. What should the police do about this? And what are they likely to do now that our entire country has been convulsed over one horrific case of police misconduct?</p>
<p>We need to lower the temperature on this conversation, and many other conversations, and understand what is actually happening in our society.</p>
<p>But instead of doing this, we now have a whole generation of social activists who seem eager to play a game of chicken with the forces of chaos. Everything I said about the problem of inequality and the need for reform stands. But I think that what we are witnessing in our streets, and on social media, and even in the mainstream press, is a version of mass hysteria. And the next horrific video of a black person being killed by cops won’t be evidence to the contrary. And there will be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a>. There are 10 million arrests every year. There will always be another video.</p>
<p>And the media has turned these videos into a form of political pornography. And this has deranged us. We’re now unable to speak or even think about facts. The media has been poisoned by bad incentives, in this regard, and social media doubly so.</p>
<p>In the mainstream of this protest movement, it’s very common to hear that the only problem with what is happening in our streets, apart from what the cops are doing, is that some criminal behavior at the margins—a little bit of looting, a little bit of violence—has distracted us from an otherwise necessary and inspiring response to an epidemic of racism. Most people in the media have taken exactly this line. People like Anderson Cooper on CNN or the editorial page of the New York Times or public figures like President Obama or Vice President Biden. The most prominent liberal voices believe that the protests themselves make perfect moral and political sense, and that movements like Black Lives Matter are guaranteed to be on the right side of history. How could anyone who is concerned about inequality and injustice in our society see things any other way? How could anyone who isn’t himself racist not support Black Lives Matter?</p>
<p>But, of course, there’s a difference between slogans and reality. There’s a difference between the branding of a movement and its actual aims. And this can be genuinely confusing. That’s why propaganda works. For instance, many people assume there’s nothing wrong with ANTIFA, because this group of total maniacs has branded itself as “anti-fascist.” What could be wrong with being anti-fascist? Are you pro fascism?</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem with Black Lives Matter—though, happily, unlike ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter actually seems committed to peaceful protest, which is hugely important. So the problem I’m discussing is more ideological, and it’s much bigger than Black Lives Matter—though BLM is its most visible symbol of this movement. The wider issue is that we are in the midst of a public hysteria and moral panic. And it has been made possible by a near total unwillingness, particularly on the Left, among people who value their careers and their livelihoods and their reputations, and fear being hounded into oblivion online—this is nearly everyone left-of-center politically. People are simply refusing to speak honestly about the problem of race and racism in America.</p>
<p>We are making ourselves sick. We are damaging our society. And by protesting the wrong thing, even the slightly wrong thing, and unleashing an explosion of cynical criminality in the process—looting that doesn’t even have the pretense of protest—the Left is empowering Trump, whatever the polls currently show. And if we are worried about Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, as I think we really should be, this is important to understand. He recently had what looked like paramilitary troops guarding the White House. I don’t know if we found out who those guys actually were, but that was genuinely alarming. But how are Democrats calls to “abolish the police” going to play to half the country that just watched so many cities get looted? We have to vote Trump out of office and restore the integrity of our institutions. And we have to make the political case for major reforms to deal with the problem of inequality—a problem which affects the black community most of all.</p>
<p>We need police reform; we need criminal justice reform; we need tax reform; we need health care reform; we need environmental reform—we need all of these things and more. And to be just, these policies will need to reduce the inequality in our society. If we did this, African Americans would benefit, perhaps more than any other group. But it’s not at all clear that progress along these dimensions primarily entails us finding and eradicating more racism in our society.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, what would real progress on the problem of racism look like? What would utter progress look like?</p>
<p>Here’s what I think it would look like: More and more people (and ultimately all people) would care less and less (and ultimately not at all) about race. As I’ve said before in various places, skin color would become like hair color in its political and moral significance—which is to say that it would have none.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you don’t agree with that aspiration. Maybe you think that tribalism based on skin color can’t be outgrown or shouldn’t be outgrown. Well, if you think that, I’m afraid I don’t know what to say to you. It’s not that there’s nothing to say, it’s just there is so much we disagree about, morally and politically, that I don’t know where to begin. So that debate, if it can even be had, will have to be left for another time.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this conversation, I have to assume that you agree with me about the goal here, which is to say that you share the hope that there will come a time where the color of a person’s skin really doesn’t matter. What would that be like?</p>
<p>Well, how many blondes got into Harvard this year? Does anyone know? What percentage of the police in San Diego are brunette? Do we have enough red heads in senior management in our Fortune 500 companies? No one is asking these questions, and there is a reason for that. No one cares. And we are right not to care.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which people cared about hair color to the degree that we currently care—or seem to care, or imagine that others care, or allege that they secretly care—about skin color. Imagine a world in which discrimination by hair color was a thing, and it took centuries to overcome, and it remains a persistent source of private pain and public grievance throughout society, even where it no longer exists. What an insane misuse of human energy that would be. What an absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p>The analogy isn’t perfect, for a variety of reasons, but it’s good enough for us to understand what life would be like if the spell of racism and anti-racism were truly broken. The future we want is not one in which we have all become passionate anti-racists. It’s not a future in which we are forever on our guard against the slightest insult—the bad joke, the awkward compliment, the tweet that didn’t age well. We want to get to a world in which skin color and other superficial characteristics of a person become morally and politically irrelevant. And if you don’t agree with that, what did you think Martin Luther King Jr was talking about?</p>
<p>And, finally, if you’re on the Left and don’t agree with this vision of a post-racial future, please observe that the people who agree with you, the people who believe that there is no overcoming race, and that racial identity is indissoluble, and that skin color really matters and will always matter—these people are white supremacists and neo-Nazis and other total assholes. And these are also people I can’t figure out how to talk to, much less persuade.</p>
<p>So the question for the rest of us—those of us who want to build a world populated by human beings, merely—the question is, how do we get there? How does racial difference become uninteresting? Can it become uninteresting by more and more people taking a greater interest in it? Can it become uninteresting by becoming a permanent political identity? Can it become uninteresting by our having thousands of institutions whose funding (and, therefore, very survival) depends on it remaining interesting until the end of the world?</p>
<p>Can it become less significant by being granted more and more significance? By becoming a fetish, a sacred object, ringed on all sides by taboos? Can race become less significant if you can lose your reputation and even your livelihood, at any moment, by saying one wrong word about it?</p>
<p>I think these questions answer themselves. To outgrow our obsession with racial difference, we have outgrow our obsession with race. And you don’t do that by maintaining your obsession with it.</p>
<p>Now, you might agree with me about the goal and about how a post-racial society would seem, but you might disagree about the path to get there—the question of what to do next. In fact, one podcast listener wrote to me recently to say that while he accepted my notion of a post-racial future, he thinks it’s just far too soon to talk about putting racial politics behind us. He asked me to imagine just how absurd it would have been to tell Martin Luther King Jr, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, that the path beyond racism requires that he become less and less obsessed with race.</p>
<p>That seems like a fair point, but Coleman Hughes has drawn my attention to a string of MLK quotes that seem to be just as transcendent of racial identity politics as I’m hoping to be here. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1087593991976243200?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see these quotations</a> on his Twitter feed. None of those statements by King would make sense coming out of Black Lives Matter at the moment.</p>
<p>In any case, as I said, I think we are living in a very different time than Martin Luther King was. And what I see all around me is evidence of the fact that we were paying an intolerable price for confusion about racism, and social justice generally—and the importance of identity, generally—and this is happening in an environment where the path to success and power for historically disadvantaged groups isn’t generally barred by white racists who won’t vote for them, or hire them, or celebrate their achievements, or buy their products, and it isn’t generally barred by laws and policies and norms that are unfair. There is surely still some of that. But there must be less of it now than there ever was.</p>
<p>The real burden on the black community is the continued legacy of inequality—with respect to wealth, and education, and health, and social order—levels of crime, in particular, and resulting levels of incarceration, and single-parent families—and it seems very unlikely that these disparities, whatever their origin in the past, can be solved by focusing on problem of lingering racism, especially where it doesn’t exist. And the current problem of police violence seems a perfect case in point.</p>
<p>And yet now we’re inundated with messages from every well-intentioned company and organization singing from the same book of hymns. Black Lives Matter is everywhere. Of course, black lives matter. But the messaging of this movement about the reality of police violence is wrong, and it’s creating a public hysteria.</p>
<p>I just got a message from the American Association for the Advancement of Science talking about fear of the other. The quote from the email: “Left unchecked, racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of the other can enter any organization or community – and destroy the foundations upon which we must build our future.” Ok, fine. But is that really the concern in the scientific community right now, “unchecked racism, sexism, and homophobia.” Is that really what ails science in the year 2020? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you the fear of the other that does seem warranted, everywhere, right now. It’s the other who has rendered him or herself incapable of dialogue. It’s the other who will not listen to reason, who has no interest in facts, who can’t join a conversation that converges on the truth, because he knows in advance what the truth must be. We should fear the other who thinks that dogmatism and cognitive bias aren’t something to be corrected for, because they’re the very foundations of his epistemology.  We should fear the other who can’t distinguish activism from journalism or politics from science. Or worse, can make these distinctions, but refuses to. And we’re all capable of becoming this person. If only for minutes or hours at a time. And this is a bug in our operating system, not a feature. We have to continually correct for it.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking things that many of us learned when the Covid-19 pandemic was first landing on our shores, and we were weighing the pros and cons of closing the schools, was that for tens of millions of American kids, going to school represents the only guarantee of a decent meal on any given day. I’m pretty confident that most of the kids we’re talking about here aren’t white. And whatever you think about the opportunities in this country and whatever individual success stories you can call to mind, there is no question that some of us start on third base, or second base. Everyone has a lot to deal with, of course. Life is hard. But not everyone is a single mom, or single grandparent, struggling to raise kids in the inner city, all the while trying to keep them from getting murdered. The disparities in our society are absolutely heartbreaking and unacceptable. And we need to have a rational discussion about their actual causes and solutions.</p>
<p>We have to pull back from the brink here. And all we have with which to do that is conversation. And the only thing that makes conversation possible is an openness to evidence and arguments—a willingness to update one’s view of the world when better reasons are given. And that is an ongoing process, not a place we ever finally arrive.</p>
<p>Ok… Well, perhaps that was more of an exhortation than I intended, but it certainly felt like I needed to say it. I hope it was useful. And the conversations will continue on this podcast.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>

    <title>A few thoughts on the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://samharris.org/thoughts-implosion-pangburn-philosophy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, the Day of Reflection conference, scheduled for November 17 in NYC, has been cancelled, and some hundreds of ticket holders are now left seeking refunds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was forced to pull out of this event &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/1043277230632132608"&gt;nearly two months ago&lt;/a&gt; and have said very little about it since. Now that Travis Pangburn has officially announced that he will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PangburnInspire/status/1062431248205864962"&gt;“folding” his touring company&lt;/a&gt;, Pangburn Philosophy, I can give a brief account of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I participated in 10 events organized by Pangburn Philosophy between September 2017 and July 2018. I didn’t always approve of the way those events were staged or marketed, but all of them appeared to be successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, after the cancellation of an August 2018 conference in Auckland, Pangburn seemed intent on running his business off a cliff. He owed a lot of money to several speakers at that point, in the form of unpaid fees and reimbursements. Most egregiously, he seemed less than fully committed to refunding ticket holders for the cancelled Auckland conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, I had two more dates on the calendar with Pangburn in 2018: a dialogue with Brian Greene in Toronto (September 5) and the Day of Reflection conference in New York (November 17). I kept my appointment in Toronto because I was contractually obligated to do so. I also didn’t want to do anything that would harm Pangburn’s ability to pay his mounting debts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Toronto, however, it became clear that Pangburn could not be trusted to put his house in order. Facing a total lack of transparency, and realizing that Pangburn was using my ongoing association with him to book future speakers, I withdrew from the NYC conference on September 21 (as well as from a Vancouver conference scheduled for March 2019). Legally, I was able to do this because Pangburn was in breach of my speaking contract. Ethically, I had a far more compelling reason to back out: I couldn’t promote or participate in an event for which I believed other speakers were unlikely to get paid; nor could I continue to work with someone who still hadn’t given refunds to ticket holders for a conference that had been canceled more than a month before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I withdrew from the NYC conference, my management team asked Pangburn to give us the email addresses of all ticket holders so that we could notify them that I was no longer involved with the event. Pangburn refused to provide this information. However, he assured us that he would notify everyone himself. (I do not know whether he ever did.) He then stopped responding to our emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the time I pulled out of the NYC conference, I assumed that the revenue from ticket sales was still safely in the box office and that Pangburn would be obliged to issue refunds should the conference fail. That’s how things normally work, especially at a reputable venue like Lincoln Center. It hadn’t occurred to me that New York ticketholders might suffer the same fate as those in Auckland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was left with a legal and ethical puzzle that I could not solve. Again, I had no way to communicate with ticket holders directly, and discussing the chaos surrounding Pangburn on my podcast never seemed like an option. Several friends and colleagues still had events on the calendar with him, and I didn’t want to do anything to derail them. In addition, many speakers who were aware of my reasons for pulling out of the NYC conference were still signed on and seemed intent on making it work. I couldn’t see anything to do that wouldn’t risk creating further harms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Pangburn still owes several speakers (including me) an extraordinary amount of money, we were willing to participate in the NYC conference for free as recently as a few days ago, if he would have handed it over to us and stepped away. I have been told that this offer was made, and he declined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it appalling that so many people were needlessly harmed by the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy. I can assure you that every speaker associated with the NYC event will be much wiser when working with promoters in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let’s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook’s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>

<blockquote><p>PRESS RELEASE MARCH 12 2013</p>
<p>Catholic Church’s Rights to “The Work of God” Stand Trial</p>
<p>On Friday, presumably immediately after a new Pope has been elected, The Danish High Maritime &amp; Commercial Court of Denmark, will make a historical verdict upon who has the rights to use the age old philosophical &amp; theological concept of “opus dei” (The Work of God).</p>
<p>The former Pope’s personal Prelature has claimed sole rights to the concept since the 1980s, right up until it was inevitably challenged by the small Danish card game publishing house, Dema Games, when they registered (and had officially approved), their trademark: “Opus-Dei: Existence After Religion”. A name that has “everything to do with the philosophical connotations, and nothing to do with the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei” , Managing Director, Mark Rees-Andersen says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dema Games, and their Pro Bono lawyer Janne Glæsel from the prestigious Copenhagen-based law firm, Gorrissen Federspiel, has chosen to counter-sue the Prelature, which now might lose their rights to their EU-trademark, which due to EU-law, the Danish court has authority to make rulings on behalf of.  The sue was an immediate media security event.  Federspiel was last seen with a team of <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-york-city-guard-services/">event security Manhattan</a> escorting him due to this new law.  In effect, he has his own concierge security service.</p>
<p>Why the sub-division of the Catholic Church may lose their rights, is mainly due to the argument, that the Prelature’s registration was invalid from the very beginning, as no one can legally monopolize religious concepts. The church has since stepped up security and started<span style="color: #222222;"> monitoring specific or heightened terrorist threats or alerts. Since then a security team from <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration:inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-yorkfire-safety-management/">VIP Protection New York City</a> patrols the outside.  Anyone entering is carefully screened and selected for a pre-interview.</span></p>
<p>The case has been ongoing for four years, and Mark Rees-Andersen has singlehandedly successfully defended his legal rights to his game’s website in 2009, at Nominet, the authority of domain-rights issues in the UK. Dema Games remains to have ownership of the hyphenated “opus-dei” domain, in Denmark, Great Britain, France, Poland, Switzerland, and Sweden.</p>

    <title>Tim Minchin “fucking disappointed” as Xmas song is censored by ITV</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Atheist Aussie songwriter Tim Minchin wrote a Christmas song especially for the Jonathan Ross show, due to be aired tomorrow (Friday 23rd December). It&amp;#8217;s a typically witty, off-the-wall composition which compares Jesus to Woody Allen, and several other things.&lt;/p&gt;
