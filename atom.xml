<p>There‚Äôs one thing my students haven‚Äôt quite figured out yet. I do set deadlines on all the assignments, because the software requires it, but‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt care. I just want them to do the work so they know <em>how</em> to do the work, and so I can see where maybe they‚Äôre going down the wrong path, but deadlines are an invention of The Man (or maybe Satan). Try to turn things in on time so they don‚Äôt pile up on you, but if it‚Äôs a few days late, I‚Äôm OK with that.</p>
<p>But these are all conscientious Midwestern kids, many of them first generation college students, so I get an amazing flood of email the day of, full of apologies and reasons why they didn‚Äôt meet the deadline, which I have to read, too. I get all these panicky messages sent just before midnight, ‚Äúoh no I couldn‚Äôt solve this problem, I‚Äôm struggling with it, I can‚Äôt get it done on time‚Äù followed by a 3am follow-up, ‚ÄúI figured it out, I submitted it a little late, I hope that‚Äôs OK‚Äù.</p>
<p>I just want to say‚Ä¶Dudes. It‚Äôs fine. The software sets this specific 11:59pm deadline minute, but I‚Äôm <em>sleeping</em> then. I‚Äôm not hovering over the computer, ready to dock points from anyone who turns it in at 12:01am. Or even noon the next day. The only real deadline is when I go over the answers in class a few days later, because I want you to think them through yourself, rather than getting handed them. If you turn something in a little late, well, that‚Äôs a time-management issue you should work on, but I‚Äôm going to pretend it was turned in precisely on time and give you full credit, because <em>I don‚Äôt care</em>. All I care about is whether you learned the subject matter.</p>
<p>I guess I‚Äôd have to worry if every student procrastinated and I couldn‚Äôt get the bulk of the grading done at the time I set aside for it, but that hasn‚Äôt happened yet in 40 years, and the Midwestern work ethic means it‚Äôs not going to happen in the near future. Chill. Go for a walk. Enjoy the flowers and the spiders while you can. Biology isn‚Äôt a punishment drill, it‚Äôs supposed to be something that makes you happy.</p>

    <title>Shutting down websites used by sex workers is part of a dangerous trend</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5847/shutting-down-websites-used-by-sex-workers-is-part-of-a-dangerous-trend#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/SWs.jpg" height="552" alt="SWs" width="680" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sex work today is often advertised digitally, or conducted exclusively online. Over the last 15 years the rise of digital platforms like Adultwork, Vivastreet and OnlyFans has transformed the logistical side of selling sexual services, replacing or supplementing more traditional methods such as word of mouth, picking up clients outdoors or working in brothels. There is evidence to show that these online platforms provide significant increases in safety and independence for many of the workers that use them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently, however, anti-sex-worker campaigners have started to target the sites that sex workers use, attempting to shut them down. They believe that prostitution is inherently a form of violence against women and girls, and view the crackdown on websites as a step towards the eventual abolition of the sex industry. Few are willing to hear from current sex workers, whose lives and livelihoods are at stake. What&amp;rsquo;s the reality on the ground, and what would sex work look like if these campaigners got their way?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many sex workers in Britain today use online platforms like Adultwork and Vivastreet as advertising directories, creating profiles to find clients. While third-party managers might take this role in agencies or brothels, these platforms help independent workers to develop their own client bases. Workers can orient their profiles towards different services, including full service work, BDSM provision, or online content such as webcamming, messaging, pictures or videos. Clients are also able to set up profiles and send messages, arranging to purchase services. Some platforms are specific to particular forms of work. OnlyFans, for example, gears itself towards online workers. It uses a subscriber model for access to online content like videos, photos and messaging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At present, in the UK, selling sex is partially criminalised. It is legal to sell and buy sexual services in England, Scotland and Wales, while clients are criminalised in Northern Ireland. &amp;ldquo;Brothel-keeping&amp;rdquo; (the definition of which includes working together with a friend for safety), &amp;ldquo;loitering&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;soliciting&amp;rdquo; are criminalised. Acting as a third party &amp;ndash; which includes being a boss of an agency, but has also resulted in criminal charges for receptionists and maids in venues selling sex &amp;ndash; is illegal. Paying for sex with someone who has been coerced is also a criminal offence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given this legal framework, some of the logistical change of online platforms is positive. Not all workers wish to work indoors, but platforms can open up access to indoor work for those who do. This is often safer. Outdoor sex workers are legislated against under the auspices of &amp;ldquo;anti-social behaviour&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;loitering&amp;rdquo;, and are more likely than indoor workers (who are less visible) to be subject to incarceration and police violence. With the freedom to set up and market their own profiles, workers are better able to advertise independently of third parties like managers and bosses. It also makes working casually &amp;ndash; around school hours or a disability &amp;ndash; more possible. Crucially, the platforms also allow for more extensive safety screening practices. Messaging can enable screening in advance of an in-person meet, and review systems mean workers can share positive and negative feedback about clients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nicola has been a full-service sex worker for ten years. I asked why she uses sites like Adultwork and Friday-Ad. She said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A life&amp;rsquo;s work is on those websites - photographs, feedback, emails, numbers, notes to myself about clients, notes to other girls, previous names that clients have used to try and outsmart us . . . girls can share information privately and leave feedback about a client . . . If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have that, it would be dicing with danger every time I answer the phone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;For sex workers, then, there are clear benefits to using websites to facilitate their work. However, while advertising online is ostensibly legal in the UK, this could be about to change, with a push for more criminalisation that explicitly targets sex workers&amp;rsquo; access to online platforms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Campaigners pushing to shut down and criminalise online platforms used by sex workers have rallied around the Nordic Model Bill. The bill draws its inspiration from Sweden, which was the first country in 1999 to implement legislation that decriminalised sex workers while criminalising their clients. Since then, similar legislation has been passed in Norway, Iceland, Canada, France and Ireland. Though lobbying has been ongoing for decades, 2021 has seen a particular parliamentary mobilisation, with repeated attempts made to pass a Nordic Model bill in England and Wales. Spearheaded by Dame Diana Johnson MP, the most recent bill has supporters including Sarah Champion, Diane Abbott and campaign groups like Nordic Model Now!, as well as a supportive layer of journalists writing within the national press. A 2020 report titled &amp;ldquo;Online Pimping&amp;rdquo; draws heavily on statements from law enforcement and anti-trafficking groups, presenting sexual services platforms as &amp;ldquo;major enabler[s] of sex trafficking and sexual exploitation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some anti-sex-worker campaigners believe that criminalisation will &amp;ldquo;end demand&amp;rdquo; from would-be sex buyers, reducing the amount of sex work in total and sending the cultural message that purchasing sexual services is gendered exploitation. They argue that the provision of exit services &amp;ndash; as part of Nordic Model legislation &amp;ndash; will support women selling sex to find alternative forms of work. A minority of anti-sex-industry campaigners are women with experience of prostitution, whose violent experiences have led them to the position that the industry must be abolished for all. Yet for many anti-sex-worker campaigners the cause is more abstract, their opposition based on the principle that men should not be able to buy sex from women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This position appears not to take into account the ongoing, tireless work of the sex-worker-led movement in the UK, including groups like the English Collective of Prostitutes, SWARM, SCOT-PEP and Decrim Now. The movement is united in its fight for full legal decriminalisation: the right to work free from criminal punishment or police brutality. In diverse ways, sex-worker activist groups seek to end violence against sex workers, and towards sex-worker survival. They argue that &amp;ldquo;sex work is work&amp;rdquo;: a slogan which doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that sex work is good, desirable or empowering work, but rather that it is often the best option for those with a constricted range of choices &amp;ndash; where the other option may be poverty, starvation or &lt;br /&gt;homelessness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anti-sex-worker campaigners often conflate sex work, commercial sexual exploitation and sex trafficking, arguing that a labour rights framework, in which exploited workers are supported in unionising for rights at work, doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply where sex is involved. In her Sexual Exploitation Bill, Diana Johnson characterises online platforms as part of the issue, describing them as &amp;ldquo;profit-making pimping websites operat[ing] free from criminal sanction, helping sex traffickers to quickly and easily advertise their victims and reaping enormous profits from doing so&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This approach paints online platforms as primarily aiding exploitative third parties, ignoring the evidence that the information sharing and community building they facilitate improves safety. Much of this kind of rhetoric aims to discuss sex workers without having to see or hear from them. Social media platforms in particular help to amplify sex workers in speaking for themselves. It is harder to make false claims about what sex workers want when they can more directly tell you what they think. This is perhaps one reason why sex workers&amp;rsquo; greater ability to speak independently via the internet is being targeted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April, a coalition of sex-worker groups in the UK, united under the banner Decrim Now, released a letter opposing attempts to criminalise their clients and close down their websites. It said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Criminalising clients has been shown to increase violence for the most marginalised workers, the same workers often conflated with trafficked victims. With the fall in clients, sex workers are forced to say yes to dangerous clients and services they would otherwise say no to, just to survive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The letter also explains that with websites taken down, workers are more likely to rely on exploitative bosses to find clients, while losing access to vital safety resources. Those who oppose sex work, and those who advocate for sex-worker rights, all agree that trafficking and exploitation are abhorrent. Human trafficking, forced labour and sexual exploitation are already illegal under the 2015 Modern Slavery Act. As Decrim Now argues, further criminalisation doesn&amp;rsquo;t help end trafficking or exploitation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as other industries where trafficking occurs are not criminalised [the solution is to] ensure people have legal ways to migrate, have routes out of poverty, and are empowered to seek support from authorities without the fear of penalty such as detention, deportation or destitution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cracking down on online spaces used for sex work will not help to end trafficking or exploitation. In fact, as Decrim Now points out, it worsens the problem. Nonetheless, recent legislation in the US has already led to the closure of websites similar to Adultwork that had helped sex workers make a living and keep safe. In 2018, former President Trump signed two bills which led to the closure of advertising sites, titled FOSTA-SESTA (the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act). FOSTA-SESTA makes online platforms legally responsible for the content they host. Against the threat of liability, sites responded fearfully. The FBI seized the popular US site Backpage days before the bill&amp;rsquo;s passage. Then Craigslist personals, Eros, Cityvibe, community "subreddits" and independent sex worker websites hosted on US-based servers were removed, almost overnight. When sex workers are moved offline they are not magically able to find better incomes or other work; they are forced to work in worse conditions, or face poverty. Taking accounts down only exposes them to greater danger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A community report based on research and data collected by two sex-worker organisations, Hacking//Hustling and Whose Corner is it Anyway, conducted online and verbal surveys with US-based sex workers 18 months after FOSTA-SESTA was signed into law. They found that 72 per cent of those surveyed faced increased economic instability, while 33 per cent experienced increased violence from clients. A total of 99 per cent said that the law did not make them feel safer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To defend sex workers&amp;rsquo; right to find work online is not to imagine that large advertising directories are pro-worker. Building a client base online can involve a form of gamification: workers invest increasing capital and time to buy advertising slots and appear higher in the feeds. On OnlyFans the need to regularly &amp;ldquo;drop&amp;rdquo; new content can necessitate long working hours. While platform owners, like other third parties, may provide sex workers with a useful service, they also enact a worrying level of control over how workers are able to work. Like other platforms, such as Deliveroo, Uber or Spotify, directory sites extract profit from workers, and appoint themselves as money-making middlemen in a way that is unaccountable to the workers themselves. As monopolies, they squeeze out alternatives: only the most well-off independent escorts can afford to keep separate websites competitive. And, of course, advertising online requires internet access, capital for hotel rent, outfits and photos, and English fluency for copywriting. While some workers prefer the autonomy of outdoor work, this bar to access continues to mean that the most marginalised women are concentrated in lower paid and higher risk parts of the industry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we have to look at the alternatives, as well as the history of what happens in practice when methods of advertising and selling sex are shut down. Over recent decades, as sex workers have used one method of advertising, the government criminalises it, and the pattern repeats. The criminalisation of the public display of sex-worker business cards exemplifies the trend. From the 1990s onwards, sex workers working indoors in London and Brighton used to advertise by placing what were colloquially called &amp;ldquo;tart cards&amp;rdquo; in phone booths. These business cards would display a name, phone number, a picture, and a brief slogan suggestive of the services offered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2001, Sections 46 and 47 were added to the Criminal Justice and Police Act, making leaving sex-worker business cards by public phones subject to a fine or up to six months imprisonment. This kind of criminalisation is about making sure that sex work is not seen publicly, not about making it actually go away. Save Our Eyes is the name of a contemporary anti-sex-worker group, confident in saying the quiet bit out loud. They have campaigned to have Holbeck, a managed zone for outdoor workers in Leeds, shut down on the grounds that it &amp;ldquo;blights&amp;rdquo; the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidence suggests that criminalisation alone does not lessen client numbers. Meanwhile, it will do nothing for sex workers&amp;rsquo; need to survive. As Juno Mac and Molly Smith argue in Revolting Prostitutes: &amp;ldquo;Clients are not the demand, but the supply. . . any campaign . . . to reduce business for sex workers will force them to absorb the deficit, whether in their wallets or in their working conditions.&amp;rdquo; In a similar way, the push to close down sex workers&amp;rsquo; online platforms does the opposite of what advocates say it will do: it risks increasing violence against women. I asked Nicola what she felt would happen if sex-worker online spaces were banned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would be the equivalent of going to work and seeing my office has burned down and there&amp;rsquo;s no one around to talk to. If something like Adultwork shut down, I could kiss goodbye to thousands of pounds of income. I would be destitute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, sex-worker groups would be able to organise against the profiteering middlemen who run online platforms. Properly resourced and free from criminalisation, workers could run their own sites, whether individually or cooperatively. However, the current climate of anti-sex-worker agitation and attempts to close down their work &amp;ndash; online and off &amp;ndash; makes this a distant hope. From banning tart cards to the current attempt to stop &lt;br /&gt;online advertising, the reality is that many people are uncomfortable seeing sex workers (at least in public) at all. It&amp;rsquo;s a vicious circle: when criminalisation removes sex workers from public discourse, anti-sex-worker lobbyists are able to claim they are voiceless. To end this, it is vital to see the attempted crackdown on online platforms as an issue of worker solidarity: for sex workers, and all workers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist autumn 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Why does every Hollywood baddie need a redemption story?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5846/why-does-every-hollywood-baddie-need-a-redemption-story#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/cru-27097_r_c264a6a0.jpg" height="667" alt="cru-27097_r_c264a6a0" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In February, as the pandemic entered its second year of rampage, a trailer for a new film appeared. This in itself was breathlessly exciting. Someone, somewhere was still making movies, and it stirred the possibility that we might soon slip back into the comfortable gloom of our local cinema. But that film was called &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, and after catching one whiff of this spotted monstrosity, sensible and sensitive filmgoers everywhere rose in chorus with a single indignant word: Why?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the rogues&amp;rsquo; gallery of iconic villains, Cruella de Vil ought to have pride of place. From the moment she hurled her Mercedes through the groomed streets near Regent&amp;rsquo;s Park in the adorable 1961 film 101 Dalmatians, everything important about her could be gleaned at a glance: the purplish hue of her skin, the sad nightclub gown worn during the day, the sinister cigarette holder trailing Chernobyl-like fumes. She was, in other words, that most dastardly archetype: the eccentric Tory aristocrat who has never been denied anything in her life. Boo!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surely a villain with the perfect (and perfectly funny) name of Cruella de Vil didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be explained? Yet here is Emma Stone, who dons a two-tone wig to play the infamous &amp;ldquo;vampire bat, this inhuman beast&amp;rdquo; in Craig Gillespie&amp;rsquo;s film, released simultaneously to cinemas and streaming services in the UK in May. Stone&amp;rsquo;s version is about as far away from the source material as one can get. Far from being the tyrannical inheritor of obscene wealth, Cruella has somehow been envisioned as a scampish Dickensian orphan who yearns to become an haute couture designer in early 1970s London, trying to upstage and outsew her rival, Baroness von Hellman (played by Emma Thompson).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It takes a special kind of arrogance to come up with stuff like this. Rather than purely malevolent, Cruella has suddenly and inexplicably become a striver and a good-hearted hero. Yes, kids, you too should aspire to peel the pelts from several dozen pooches. Throw out the meat and soul: looking chic is what counts. &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, was made by Disney, a company that of course bears no ill will towards things that children love, and only wants to acquire their treasures by charm and good manners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When 101 Dalmatians was made, artists thrived on the swift sketching of character. Brevity was a virtue. Then, some years ago, that talent was thrown away. Mysteries had to be confected, then revealed. No dark ancestry should be left undisturbed; every baddie ought to have an &amp;ldquo;origin story&amp;rdquo;, a juvenile trauma or critical defect that could explain their malevolent activities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For many, I suspect,&lt;em&gt; Cruella&lt;/em&gt; marks the point when the film industry&amp;rsquo;s lust for rejigs and do-overs reaches a zenith of absurdity. For more than a decade now, we&amp;rsquo;ve been deluged with rebrands and replications, clones upon copies of superhero capers and jazzed-up old classics; there seems to be nothing new under the sun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was Disney who pioneered and honed these parasitic arts, as Caroline Crampton recently pointed out in these pages (see the New Humanist Spring 2021 issue). In 2005 it embarked on a voyage of imperial conquest, gobbling up as many other studio behemoths as it could manage, bloating its prized store of intellectual properties. Pixar was bought out first, followed by Lucasfilm. Then, most ominously, came Marvel and its roster of rubbery messiahs. Since 2008 there have been &amp;ndash; count them &amp;ndash; 23 Marvel superhero films, with four due this year and seven more in the works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a company balloons to the size of a small planet and develops its own gravitational pull, everyone else is obliged to adopt the same model if they&amp;rsquo;re to avoid being torn apart. Lately, rival studios have been desperately hunting for any character or title that can match the Marvel stranglehold. This incentive to chase monopolies is what gums up the culture &amp;ndash; and the screening schedules &amp;ndash; to such a point that anyone else struggles to make a dent on public attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney&amp;rsquo;s beloved staple of animations for children (especially those made in the 1960s and 1990s) were often perfect little morsels: sweet confections carefully shaved of fat and fancy, with good jokes, no lulls and few ethical qualms. The true testament to the brilliance of those films would be to fashion something fresh in their likeness. Instead, there is the recent redux of these classics: new versions of &lt;em&gt;Aladdin, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; and so on. In form and function they cleave so closely to their originals that one wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know they were different films, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the slick digital membrane grafted over the careworn and handcrafted drawings which gave them life in the first place. The entire studio apparatus, in other words, has been geared for the maximum extraction of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of such a regime can be counted not only in the quality of the films themselves but in what they do to the culture in general. The geeks, we&amp;rsquo;re told, have won. Such a crowning victory produces some odd symptoms. Believing that all popular culture has been created for them personally and the peculiar fandoms to which they belong, fans treat the latest instalment of any superhero franchise as a titanic saga of moral instruction from which they can divine ethical codes and rudimentary ideologies. By strange alchemy, ephemeral entertainments like &lt;em&gt;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&lt;/em&gt; are somehow bumped up to the status of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Iliad&lt;/em&gt;. If you ever find yourself alone on the internet at night, be wary of stumbling across the very particular type of online activist whose Sisyphean task it is to judge whether the Avengers are doing &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;queer visibility&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the curse of domination. As the prevailing cultural force, these bombastic operas become the only frame of reference for negotiating human behaviour, for discussing politics, for working out desirable social standards. This is especially troublesome when we consider what these films actually consist of: dense swamps of formula, clich&amp;eacute; and stereotype in which desire, fury, melancholy, jealousy, ambiguity, conflict, curiosity or any other recognisable human feeling are almost entirely absent. In short: adults are ordering their lives around films made for children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those of us who yearn for an end to the monopoly model and all of its strange outgrowths, there&amp;rsquo;s an inclination to look back at the Golden Age of Hollywood for some kind of comfort. Yet that too was a totalising dynastic agglomeration. Those studios also churned out plenty of second-rate piffle &amp;ndash; much of it shaped to the rigours of Hays Code censorship. In 1944 alone, Hollywood managed to collectively squeeze out 72 different musicals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But at least one of them was &lt;em&gt;Meet Me in St. Louis&lt;/em&gt;. For the slew of detective noirs or westerns released in a year, maybe one of them could rise to the level of &lt;em&gt;The Big Sleep&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Searchers&lt;/em&gt;. The critical difference, and the reason why they endure, was that they were originals, or adapted from novels or plays. As a result, they bear the unmistakable mark of real life: of genuine struggles and triumphs, of a time when fantasy served to heighten and intensify the feelings of our own lives, not distract us from them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, when faced with the accusation that their fare is tedious and devoid of human feelings, any studio executive today will simply turn out their pockets and chuckle like Scrooge McDuck as bounteous gold bullion tinkles onto the floor. The qualities of a film simply do not register in the box office take. &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, like many others, has proved this point. Partly because there was so little else showing in theatres, the film has done surprisingly well. So well, in fact, that Disney has announced more runts for this litter: planning for &lt;em&gt;Cruella 2&lt;/em&gt; is already underway. Our morbid curiosity apparently knows no limits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist autumn 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Places of Mind</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5844/book-review-places-of-mind#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Places-of-Mind.jpg" height="772" alt="Places-of-Mind" width="361" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though books are lifegiving for me, they don&amp;rsquo;t often move me to tears. But on emerging from Timothy Brennan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Places of Mind: A Life of Edward Said&lt;/em&gt;, I found myself sobbing. Having read the biography intensely in a haze of lockdown days, breaking the flow only for exercise, food and sleep, I felt I&amp;rsquo;d met, fallen in love with and lost Edward Said all in the space of a few days. Such is the depth of the depiction of Said&amp;rsquo;s life in this careful, tender and profound exploration of a most brilliant life and mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would be difficult for any biographer to make Said&amp;rsquo;s life seem in any way dull, but there is no doubt that Brennan has an extraordinary capacity to tell a story. Said&amp;rsquo;s life, in all its brilliance, disappointments, passions and tragedies, appears in vibrant detail on the page. Said&amp;rsquo;s work holds a deeply important place in my own work as a legal scholar, and it felt like a privilege to learn about the person behind the publications and public persona.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brennan&amp;rsquo;s account is far-reaching without ever sacrificing the delicious intimacy which makes biography worth reading. We get to know Said. From the genesis and inspiration of his intellectual and political ideas, to his innermost fears. From his first love, classical music, to his passion for poetry, starting with the Victorian Gerard Manley Hopkins and ending with a newfound love for the Greek poet C. P. Cavafy late in his life. From his struggle with self-doubt, to his love of flattery. From his tireless campaigning for justice, to his guilt at failing to improve the plight of others. From the high demands he sometimes placed on his students, to his affection, sense of humour and generosity. From his hypochondria to his deep hunger for connection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Said&amp;rsquo;s principal political concern, the site where he continually returned his mind and invested his passion and energy, was his homeland, Palestine. Brennan dedicates the book to the Palestinian people, mirroring and honouring his tracing of a life dedicated to the very same. Said&amp;rsquo;s work seeking justice for Palestinians is a better-known aspect of his life, due to the public attention his efforts attracted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What Brennan draws beautifully for the reader is a rare picture of a young Said, a junior professor trying to make his name through his academic writing, struggling to carve out space in his intellectual work for his politics and his person. These aspects of his background and personality seemed to him inseparable from his intellectual endeavours. As the world&amp;rsquo;s injustices begged for his attention, often prompting in him feelings of frustration at not doing enough from his comfortable life in New York, Said committed his intellectual writing to showing his colleagues how they might also put their minds to work for progressive political change beyond the academy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Places of Mind offers a portrayal of Said as a person, continually displaced and exiled as a result of the British Empire&amp;rsquo;s machinations and its latent and ongoing colonial effects, trying to find both himself and his place in the world. What we glean from Brennan&amp;rsquo;s narrative is a subtle but powerful sense that Said realised early on in life that one must know oneself, one&amp;rsquo;s mind and one&amp;rsquo;s place in the world; not in any fixed or static way, but through profound searching, in order to do the crucial work of reaching others. And it is others Said so desperately wanted to reach, people like him &amp;ldquo;in their rebellion and in their hope&amp;rdquo;, to quote his friend and correspondent, the feminist writer H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Cixous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Said, therefore, one has the sense of a person who knew himself, who never neglected his mind, tending to his emotional life by having therapy throughout adulthood and feeding his soul with poetry and music. Brennan shows us how, by bringing himself as close as possible to himself, Said could become the effective political actor we know him to be. He was not only able to empathise with others, but to arrive at an understanding of the complexity of the human psyche in a world disfigured by colonial violence. He both acknowledged the dangers posed by attachments to victimhood in collective organising, and was willing to engage in the necessarily messy aspects of truly inclusive political struggle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Said maintained that biological or religious connections to a struggle are not what matters. What matters is learning to identify structures which necessitate the dehumanisation of people, and which have long shaped our psyches and enabled historical events which continue to impact the present. What matters is coming to terms with our own guilt and shame; and feeling our own pain so that we can feel the pain of others; so that we do not hurt others in the way we have been hurt ourselves; so that we do not bite our tongues, but connect with others in the struggle for freedom from oppression. These are lessons that those of us committed to freedom struggles today still need to learn, imbibe and practise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Said refused to dodge the realities of political struggle, but at the same time dismissed the false trope of &amp;ldquo;complexity&amp;rdquo;, all too often mobilised to quell resistance to the oppression of Palestinians. He understood that the Palestinian people are struggling for liberation from colonial oppression, from al-Nakba al-mustamera, or &amp;ldquo;the ongoing disaster&amp;rdquo;. He argued that what solidarity asks of all of us is that we speak out and act against oppression in all its forms, that we recognise Palestinians as an empowered, purposive people with desires and voices of their own, engaged in the project of their own liberation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a writer, Said was both careful and fearless, remarkably borderless in mind and in the disciplines, sources and theories he leaned upon. Through his writings, Said sought to clarify and distil ideas, to communicate in a manner which opened the way for collective organising that stood a chance of righting wrongs, of making the world &amp;ndash; in particular, pained parts of it &amp;ndash; more equal and just places to inhabit. Places where people can live and thrive and move without fear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To Brennan we owe a deep debt of gratitude, for showing us what we still stand to learn from Said in our own connected intellectual, personal and political struggles. And for gifting us this seamlessly composed, rich, moving and heartfelt tale of a life and mind so missed &amp;ndash; and so needed in our current political moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist autumn 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>How statues can bring us together</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5842/how-statues-can-bring-us-together#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title=" The Emily Wilding Davison statue by the sculptor Christine Charlesworth, Epsom High Street, June 2021" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Emily_Wilding_Davison_statue,_Epsom_High_Street__July_2021_.jpg" height="805" alt="Emily_Wilding_Davison_statue,_Epsom_High_Street__July_2021_" width="1065" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Are public statues more trouble than they&amp;rsquo;re worth? You might think so from the racially charged political rows over imperial and civil war statues across North America, Britain and parts of Western Europe. The black British journalist Gary Younge has suggested pulling them all down, recalling an unedifying squabble in 2002, when he was &amp;aring;an inaugural member of the Mayor of London&amp;rsquo;s fourth plinth committee for Trafalgar Square. He thinks Britain&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;statue obsession mistakes adulation for history, history for heritage and heritage for memory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Sculptor Anthony Gormley has offered a less sweeping but more mischievous alternative: after years of protests at Oxford University&amp;rsquo;s Oriel College, undergraduates, teaching staff, the governing body and a specially convened independent commission all voted to take down a controversial Cecil Rhodes figure outside its entrance. But the Westminster government&amp;rsquo;s new &amp;ldquo;retain and explain&amp;rdquo; policy on statues led the college to abandon the plan in May this year, citing the cost of lengthy legal action. Gormley suggested turning Rhodes to face the wall; a shaming gesture, in the spirit of the policy intervention blocking its removal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;While institutions might be cautious about statues, however, ordinary citizens are crowd-funding all over Britain to put them up, especially ones of women. This reveals a much more positive idea of why they still matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;In Epsom town centre in June, cross-party politicians joined local schoolchildren, business people and members of Emily Wilding Davison&amp;rsquo;s family for the unveiling of a new bronze statue of the suffragette. She had died after being accidentally trampled under the King&amp;rsquo;s horse at the Derby in 1915, while trying to tie colours to its reins. The fact that for a century her death &amp;ndash; despite being caught on film &amp;ndash; had wrongly been portrayed as a &amp;ldquo;hysterical&amp;rdquo; suicide made her commemoration all the more moving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;A local councillor told me that he hoped the statue could be a draw for visitors and shoppers, as Epsom, like so many other town centres, tried to revive footfall after the Covid pandemic. Two headgirls from nearby Rosebery School said her statue was a reminder &amp;ldquo;to stay active in our pursuit of justice and never settle for anything less than genuine change&amp;rdquo;. They pointed out that only 3 per cent of statues were of named, non-royal women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Though it is made from bronze, this crowdfunded statue is not on a plinth or pillar, to be worshipped like Rhodes or Nelson. Davison sits on a bench for visitors to sit next to and engage with. Objects are also incorporated into the work &amp;ndash; Davison is holding a book and her academic mortarboard is next to her. The artist, Christine Charlesworth, has a track record and a full commission book of statues of women achievers, such as composer Dame Ethel Smyth for Woking town centre and Greta Thunberg for Winchester University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Meanwhile, Maggie Hambling&amp;rsquo;s much-mocked tiny naked silver female figure for the Mary Wollstonecraft memorial in north London (see the &amp;ldquo;Witness&amp;rdquo; section of the &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Summer 2021 issue) suggests the danger of artistic ego getting in the way of the public desire to actually see great women who&amp;rsquo;ve been invisible for too long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;In June, a crowdfunding campaign was launched for a statue dedicated to the singer and forces&amp;rsquo; sweetheart Vera Lynn. Supported by friends, family and politicians, it was launched to mark the anniversary of Lynn&amp;rsquo;s death last year, at the age of 103. Since then, the plans have expanded to encompass a memorial park, which will sit on the white cliffs of Dover, the subject of Lynn&amp;rsquo;s most famous song, a hit during the Second World War. The Dame Vera Lynn Memorial Park will include a council-funded amphitheatre for concerts, offering another opportunity to bring people together. Early sketches by the artist Paul Day suggest that the statue will see Lynn surrounded by soldiers and other figures, to emphasise her morale-boosting role in public life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Though they are very different figures, these statues of Davison and Lynn have the capacity to fill in some gaps in our history. This makes it all the more striking that the new statue to &amp;ldquo;the people&amp;rsquo;s princess&amp;rdquo; Diana is such a misfire. It&amp;rsquo;s got a realism which those of us who aren&amp;rsquo;t art critics tend to like. But as a recent visitor recounted, everything about its setting &amp;ndash; inside an expensive ticketed visit to Kensington Palace &amp;ndash; feels wrong. While statues may be divisive at times, they are also bringing us together as never before, but only when we believe there is a good reason for them being there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist autumn 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Afghan refugees in Europe: what "moral duty"?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5843/afghan-refugees-in-europe-what-moral-duty#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A young Afghan child at a refugee camp in Kabul, 2010. Image: Flickr/DVIDSHUB" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/afghan2.jpg" height="1067" alt="afghan2" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An elderly man sitting outside a local minimarket on the Greek island of Samos turns to his friends and laments, &amp;ldquo;Now thousands of Afghans are going to come to Greece.&amp;rdquo; Samos is among the country&amp;rsquo;s Aegean islands that received a combined one million asylum-seekers during 2015-2016, with tens of thousands annually since, and where hospitality is at a low ebb. Such sentiments were expressed at an official level too, with the Greek migration minister swift to &lt;a href="https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1166358/greece-says-cannot-become-gateway-to-eu-for-fleeing-afghans/"&gt;declare&lt;/a&gt; in response to the unravelling disaster in Afghanistan that his country &amp;ldquo;will not and cannot be the gateway of Europe for the refugees and migrants who could try to come to the European Union.&amp;rdquo; Citing the millions who now threatened to leave Afghanistan for the continent, he stated that Greece&amp;rsquo;s borders will remain &amp;ldquo;inviolable&amp;rdquo;. The minister&amp;rsquo;s remarks came as he toured a 25-mile strip of high-surveillance &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58289893"&gt;fencing&lt;/a&gt; his government had just installed at its northern border with Turkey amid fears of escalating arrivals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other EU leaders advocated a similar zero-tolerance approach to Afghanis seeking protection in Europe via unofficial routes. Most notably, France&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/france-vows-to-stop-afghan-refugee-flow-with-european-mechanism/2337377"&gt;Emmanuel Macron&lt;/a&gt; espoused the continent&amp;rsquo;s own need to &amp;ldquo;anticipate and protect&amp;rdquo; itself against what he deemed &amp;ldquo;irregular&amp;rdquo; migratory flows from Afghanistan. Six member states &amp;ndash; including Germany, the Netherlands and Austria &amp;ndash; went so far as to issue a &lt;a href="https://www.voanews.com/europe/six-eu-countries-want-maintain-deportations-afghan-asylum-seekers"&gt;prompt letter&lt;/a&gt; to the European Commission to warn against any suspension in deportations of existing failed Afghan asylum-seekers &amp;ndash; a step they claimed could &amp;ldquo;motivate even more Afghan citizens to leave their home for the EU.&amp;rdquo; A handful of dissenting EU representatives &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/afghanistan-migrants-europe-no-eu-refugee-plan/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; on the body to instate resettlement quotas or even invoke extraordinary protection mechanisms to ensure the immediate safe passage of Afghans to Europe. Amid this by now customary fight over migration, EU commissioner Ursula von der Leyen &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210821-european-leaders-determined-to-avoid-mass-influx-of-afghan-refugees"&gt;emphasised&lt;/a&gt; the need to balance the campaign against irregular migration with international efforts to facilitate safe and legal routes into Europe for vulnerable Afghans. Such a strategy, she said, reflected the EU&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;comprehensive and balanced approach on migration set out in the new Pact on Migration and Asylum&amp;rdquo;, and more so, &amp;ldquo;our moral duty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Perception over principles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Westminster meanwhile, Boris Johnson and Priti Patel announced a &amp;ldquo;bespoke&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bespoke-resettlement-route-for-afghan-refugees-announced"&gt;resettlement scheme&lt;/a&gt; for up to 20,000 Afghan refugees (the same number as Britain&amp;rsquo;s intake from Syria), which they deemed &amp;ldquo;one of the most generous in our country&amp;rsquo;s history.&amp;rdquo; The scheme &amp;ndash; which in its fine print stipulates that resettlements will take place over five years and may be from third countries given the lack of safe passage out of Afghanistan &amp;ndash; has been described by other migration commentators as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/22/britains-offer-to-afghan-refugees-is-not-generous-but-blindly-inhumane"&gt;blindly inhumane&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; As has been pointed out, not only is the resettlement figure a mere fraction of Britain&amp;rsquo;s intake of refugees from previous conflicts (for example, Asian Ugandans or Vietnamese), a capped number is also at odds with the very notion of humanitarian assistance in a crisis of vast proportions. The scheme is instead a political gesture &amp;ndash; one that aims to project the image of UK action on Afghanistan while catering to the perceived electoral need to tackle migration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the while, Hamid Karzai International Airport assumed the semblance of a horror-film, from which any hope of escape &amp;ndash; even for those Afghans with visas or evacuation orders &amp;ndash; became evermore remote. The sluggish policy declarations of Western governments and inept, bureaucratic mechanisms for evacuating eligible Afghans appeared inured to the urgency of the circumstance. As the Taliban consolidated control of the country and escalated its hunt for collaborators, former Afghan employees of British forces told how they were counting down the days left of their lives waiting for unforthcoming replies from the UK Home Office. (Another interpreter for the German military &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172xv58804tfms"&gt;recounted&lt;/a&gt; how the Bundestag finally ordered a private vehicle to chauffeur he and his wife and two infant children to the airport, only to then be told by German forces at the gate that his name was not on a list and sent away. All he could do now was pray, the man said.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A widely-circulated photograph of an Afghan infant being handed to British troops over the razor wire at the airport seemed to best encapsulate the foreign evacuation effort: utterly piecemeal, random and contingent on individual acts of succour. As one exasperated Afghan national, a former interpreter for Western forces, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w172xv57wqv45y1"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; of the sluggish international efforts, &amp;ldquo;they are just waiting to see how the Taliban cuts our heads off and rapes my wife&amp;hellip; if they grant visas for our dead bodies, does it make sense?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Deterrence and deportation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The failure we are now witnessing on the part of EU, UK and other governments to save the lives of Afghan nationals (including those who served and protected their own citizens) is not new. Rather, the sense of betrayal voiced by so many Afghans during the catastrophic past weeks is part of a longer-standing trajectory of Western betrayal of those fleeing the country. And gratifying as it may be for the EU commissioner to invoke the imperatives of &amp;lsquo;moral duty&amp;rsquo;, the reality is that policy toward Afghan asylum seekers has been guided by neither balance nor morality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.ekathimerini.com/in-depth/analysis/1166619/europe-fears-afghan-refugee-crisis-after-taliban-takeover/"&gt;600,000 Afghans&lt;/a&gt; have applied for asylum in the twenty-seven countries of the EU bloc over the past decade. Since 2018, Afghans have outnumbered any other nationality among asylum-seekers &lt;a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5179"&gt;arriving&lt;/a&gt; to Europe via the Aegean Sea and Balkan land route. They are now the highest represented population of some 200,000 asylum-seekers in Greece and second only to Syrians among the more than 4.5 million in neighbouring &lt;a href="https://www.unhcr.org/greece.html"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. Of the more than 2,000 individuals pulled from the Aegean waters by the Turkish coastguard during the first quarter of this year, &lt;a href="https://displacement.iom.int/system/tdf/reports/Q1%202021%20Narrative%20Overview_0.pdf?file=1&amp;amp;type=node&amp;amp;id=11390"&gt;the majority&lt;/a&gt; were reported to be Afghan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale and duration of the exodus from Afghanistan to Europe has not, however, equated to a recognition of the need for protection. More than a third of the some &lt;a href="https://asylumineurope.org/reports/country/greece/statistics/"&gt;11,000 Afghans&lt;/a&gt; who applied for refugee status in Greece during 2020 were rejected in the first instance, with less than a third granted refugee status. This year alone, the EU has collectively &lt;a href="https://www.voanews.com/europe/six-eu-countries-want-maintain-deportations-afghan-asylum-seekers"&gt;deported&lt;/a&gt; some 1,200 Afghans from the continent &amp;ndash; a practice carried out routinely by member states over the past five years on the premise that Afghanistan is a &amp;lsquo;safe country&amp;rsquo;. Patently flawed to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of events in the country, such a claim contradicts the verdict of multiple &lt;a href="https://www.proasyl.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PRO_ASYL_Afghanistan_Broschuere_englisch_web_Mai17.pdf"&gt;EU envoys&lt;/a&gt; to Afghanistan and even the &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/human-rights-court-defends-afghans-right-to-stay-in-austria/a-58749001"&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; of the European High Court of Human Rights. Since 2008, Britain has surpassed any EU state in repatriating more than 15,000 Afghan asylum seekers &amp;ndash; again, on the myth of return to a &amp;ldquo;safe country&amp;rdquo;. It was not until weeks into the Taliban advance that the Home Office on 16th August &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/afghanistan-home-office-asylum-taliban-b1903482.html"&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt; its policy that those deported to Afghanistan faced no &amp;ldquo;real risk of harm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afghans attempting to the reach the European continent in recent years confront new forms of harm at the hands of EU governments. The migration policy to which Von der Leyen referred in her reassurances of safe passage is the same pact that has seen countless thousands of asylum-seekers violently repelled from Europe&amp;rsquo;s land and sea borders in &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/10/frontex-turns-blind-eye-greeces-border-abuses"&gt;push-backs&lt;/a&gt; by Greek and other member-states authorities &amp;ndash; or &lt;a href="https://alarmphone.org/en/2021/07/29/the-many-faces-of-a-shipwreck/?fbclid=IwAR3KLSM37gquj8CoB_RRBxDDVkSwfPJhMA0RTCTrc08-lBJzniYLBgWagro"&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; in the Mediterranean to die with the complicity of the EU Border and Coastguard Agency, Frontex. Within EU borders, Afghan asylum-seekers face processing times in the vicinity of years, during which they must endure precarious and often violent living conditions alongside systemic marginalisation, as EU migration policy is meted out evermore harshly in the name of &amp;lsquo;deterrence&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The promise to Afghans and the legacy of betrayal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a war with the Taliban in Afghanistan and in Europe, there is a war against refugees,&amp;rdquo; says Maryam, an Afghan woman on the island of Lesvos. A high-level campaigner for education equality and women&amp;rsquo;s rights, she came to Europe in 2018 with her husband and two daughters after direct attempts on her life by the Taliban. Almost two years later, the family received their asylum papers and Maryam has since battled bureaucracy and xenophobia simply to have her daughter admitted to school in Greece. Working women like herself have this week been warned by the Taliban against attending their workplaces and Maryam now receives daily phone-calls from friends in Afghanistan, seeking help as Taliban forces in the provinces go door-to-door demanding families hand over their daughters as young as 11-years-old. &amp;ldquo;The face of the Taliban might have changed, but their barbarism is the same,&amp;rdquo; she says, noting her fears that forced marriages and gender-based violence will increase daily &amp;ndash; just as they increased even under the US presence in Afghanistan. &amp;ldquo;Anyway, how can we really expect security or democracy from the Taliban, when even here in Europe we face discrimination, violence and a denial of rights?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those Afghans who today land on the Greek islands are typically sequestered out of reach soon after &amp;ndash; often &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/AegeanBoatReport/videos/198824612230080"&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; directly to Turkey or held for days in remote island locations without access to food and water, basic hygiene facilities or legal assistance. Like many others, Maryam has little faith in the assurances by Western governments about assisting fleeing Afghans. &amp;ldquo;Even if they promise to take people, where is the system? I believe they are just playing with people &amp;ndash; we are just another brick in the wall,&amp;rdquo; she says.&amp;ldquo;Western governments came running to Afghanistan saying &amp;lsquo;we will help you, we will give you money and hope&amp;rsquo; and expected us to kiss their hands, while with the hand, they pushed Afghans back into a dark corner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to imagine a more brutal or chaotic end to the Western campaign that begun twenty years ago than the scenes of violence and desperation now playing out across Afghanistan. As Western governments fumble for a strategy of engagement with the Taliban in advance of the evacuation deadline at the end of August, the last flights lift off from Kabul, leaving the majority of would-be evacuees to clutch at their wheels amid the crush or risk perilous overland journeys out across Taliban-policed land borders. Such violence seems to come as a final bleak vindication of the hollowness of the promises of democracy and stability that scaffolded the Western campaign in Afghanistan. From Harmid Karzai airport to EU-funded detention camps and the streets of central Athens, where Afghan families have for years slept abandoned in the open air, it is hard too, to imagine an uglier incarnation of realpolitik.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person‚Äôs choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children‚Äôs creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box. ¬†There is a ¬†need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children‚Äôs creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with ¬†Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide ¬£2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can We Pull Back From The Brink?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://samharris.org/can-pull-back-brink/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this episode of the podcast, Sam discusses the recent social protests and civil unrest, in light of what we know about racism and police violence in America.</p>
<p>This is a transcript of a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/207-can-pull-back-brink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded podcast</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Welcome to the Making Sense podcast‚Ä¶ This is Sam Harris.</p>
<p>OK‚Ä¶. Well, I‚Äôve been trying to gather my thoughts for this podcast for more than a week‚Äîand have been unsure about whether to record it at all, frankly.</p>
<p>Conversation is the only tool we have for making progress, I firmly believe that. But many of the things we most need to talk about, seem impossible to talk about.</p>
<p>I think social media is a huge part of the problem. I‚Äôve been saying for a few years now that, with social media, we‚Äôve all been enrolled in a psychological experiment for which no one gave consent, and it‚Äôs not at all clear how it will turn out. And it‚Äôs still not clear how it will turn out, but it‚Äôs not looking good. It‚Äôs fairly disorienting out there. All information is becoming weaponized. All communication is becoming performative. And on the most important topics, it now seems to be fury and sanctimony and bad faith almost all the time.</p>
<p>We appear to be driving ourselves crazy. Actually, crazy. As in, incapable of coming into contact with reality, unable to distinguish fact from fiction‚Äîand then becoming totally destabilized by our own powers of imagination, and confirmation bias, and then lashing out at one other on that basis.</p>
<p>So I‚Äôd like to talk about the current moment and the current social unrest, and its possible political implications, and other cultural developments, and suggest what it might take to pull back from the brink here. I‚Äôm going to circle in on the topics of police violence and the problem of racism, because that really is at the center of this. There is so much to talk about here, and it‚Äôs so difficult to talk about. And there is so much we don‚Äôt know. And yet, most people are behaving as though every important question was answered a long time ago.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been watching our country seem to tear itself apart for weeks now, and perhaps lay the ground for much worse to come. And I‚Äôve been resisting the temptation to say anything of substance‚Äînot because I don‚Äôt have anything to say, but because of my perception of the danger, frankly. And if that‚Äôs the way I feel, given the pains that I‚Äôve taken to insulate myself from those concerns, I know that almost everyone with a public platform is terrified. Journalists, and editors, and executives, and celebrities are terrified that they might take one wrong step here, and never recover.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdsmxzaHtSQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"/></p>
<p>And this is really unhealthy‚Äînot just for individuals, but for society. Because, again, all we have between us and the total breakdown of civilization is a series of successful conversations. If we can‚Äôt reason with one another, there is no path forward, other than violence. Conversation or violence.</p>
<p>So, I‚Äôd like to talk about some of the things that concern me about the current state of our communication. Unfortunately, many things are compounding our problems at the moment. We have a global pandemic which is still very much with us. And it remains to be seen how much our half-hearted lockdown, and our ineptitude in testing, and our uncoordinated reopening, and now our plunge into social protest and civil unrest will cause the Covid-19 caseload to spike. We will definitely see. As many have pointed out, the virus doesn‚Äôt care about economics or politics. It only cares that we keep breathing down each other‚Äôs necks. And we‚Äôve certainly been doing enough of that.</p>
<p>Of course, almost no one can think about Covid-19 right now. But I‚Äôd just like to point out that many of the costs of this pandemic and the knock-on effects in the economy, and now this protest movement, many of these costs are hidden from us. In addition to killing more than 100,000 people in the US, the pandemic has been a massive opportunity cost. The ongoing implosion of the economy is imposing tangible costs, yes, but it is also a massive opportunity cost. And now this civil unrest is compounding those problems‚Äîwhatever the merits of these protests may be or will be, the opportunity costs of this moment are staggering. In addition to all the tangible effects of what‚Äôs happening‚Äîthe injury and death, the lost businesses, the burned buildings, the neighborhoods that won‚Äôt recover for years in many cities, the educations put on hold, and the breakdown in public trust of almost every institution‚Äîjust think about all the good and important things we cannot do‚Äîcannot even <em>think</em> of doing now‚Äîand perhaps won‚Äôt contemplate doing for many years to come, because we‚Äôll be struggling to get back to that distant paradise we once called ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù</p>
<p>Of course, normal life for many millions of Americans was nothing like a paradise. The disparities in wealth and health and opportunity that we have gotten used to in this country, and that so much of our politics and ways of doing business seem to take for granted, are just unconscionable. There is no excuse for this kind of inequality in the richest country on earth. What we‚Äôre seeing now is a response to that. But it‚Äôs a confused and confusing response. Worse, it‚Äôs a response that is systematically silencing honest conversation. And this makes it dangerous.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt just politics and human suffering on display. It‚Äôs philosophy. It‚Äôs ideas about truth‚Äîabout what it means to say that something is ‚Äútrue.‚Äù What we‚Äôre witnessing in our streets and online and in the impossible conversations we‚Äôre attempting to have in our private lives is a breakdown in epistemology. How does anyone figure out what‚Äôs going on in the world? What is real? If we can‚Äôt agree about what is real, or likely to be real, we will never agree about how we should live together. And the problem is, we‚Äôre stuck with one other.</p>
<p>So, what‚Äôs happening here?</p>
<p>Well, again, it‚Äôs hard to say. What is happening when <a href="https://youtu.be/viika57hTO4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a police officer or a mayor takes a knee</a> in front of a crowd of young people who have been berating him for being a cog in the machinery of systemic racism? Is this a profound moment of human bonding that transcends politics, or is it the precursor to the breakdown of society? Or is it both? It‚Äôs not entirely clear.</p>
<p>In the most concrete terms, we are experiencing widespread social unrest in response to what is widely believed to be an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at the black community by racist cops and racist policies. And this unrest has drawn a counter-response from law enforcement‚Äîmuch of which, ironically, is guaranteed to exacerbate the problem of police violence, both real and perceived. And many of the videos we‚Äôve seen of the police cracking down on peaceful protesters are hideous. Some of this footage has been unbelievable. And this is one of many vicious circles that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>Again, there is so much to be confused about here. We‚Äôve now seen endless video of police inflicting senseless violence on truly peaceful protesters, and yet we have also seen video of the police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrVp8vlQyU">standing idly by</a> while looters completely destroy businesses. What explains this? Is there a policy that led to this bizarre inversion of priorities? Are the police angry at the protesters for vilifying them, and simultaneously trying to teach society a lesson by letting crime and mayhem spread elsewhere in the city? Or is it just less risky to collide with peaceful protesters? Or is the whole spectacle itself a lie? How representative are these videos of what‚Äôs actually going on? Is there much less chaos actually occurring than is being advertised to us?</p>
<p>Again, it‚Äôs very hard to know.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs easy to know is that civil discourse has broken down. It seems to me that we‚Äôve long been in a situation where the craziest voices on both ends of the political spectrum have been amplifying one another and threatening to produce something truly dangerous. And now I think they have. The amount of misinformation in the air‚Äîthe degree to which even serious people seem to be ruled by false assumptions and non sequiturs‚Äîis just astonishing.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that, with the presidential election coming in November, the stakes are really high. As most of you know, I consider four more years of Trump to be an existential threat to our democracy. And I believe that the last two weeks have been very good for him, politically, even when everything else seemed to go very badly for him. I know the polls don‚Äôt say this. A large majority of people disapprove of his handling this crisis so far. But I think we all know now to take polls with a grain of salt. There is the very real problem of preference falsification‚Äîespecially in an environment of intense social pressure. People will often say what they think is socially acceptable, and then think, or say, or do something very different in private‚Äîlike when they‚Äôre alone in a voting booth.</p>
<p>Trump has presided over the complete dismantling of American influence in the world and the destruction of our economy. I know the stock market has looked good, but the stock market has become totally uncoupled from the economy. According to the stock market, the future is just as bright now as it was in January of this year, before most of us had even heard of a novel coronavirus. That doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. And a lot can happen in the next few months. The last two weeks feel like a decade. And my concern is that if Trump now gets to be the law-and-order President, that may be his path to re-election, if such a path exists. Of course, this crisis has revealed, yet again, how unfit he is to be President. The man couldn‚Äôt strike a credible note of reconciliation if the fate of the country depended on it‚Äîand the fate of the country has depended on it. I also think it‚Äôs possible that these protests wouldn‚Äôt be happening, but for the fact that Trump is President. Whether or not the problem of racism has gotten worse in our society, having Trump as President surely makes it seem like it has. It has been such a repudiation of the Obama presidency that, for many people, it has made it seem that white supremacy is now ascendant. So, all the more reason to get rid of Trump in November.</p>
<p>But before this social unrest, our focus was on how incompetent Trump was in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. And now he has been given a very different battle to fight. A battle against leftwing orthodoxy, which is growing more stifling by the minute, and civil unrest. If our social order frays sufficiently, restoring it will be the only thing that most people care about in November. Just think of what an act of domestic terrorism would do politically now. Things can change very, very quickly. And to all a concern for basic law and order ‚Äúracist‚Äù, isn‚Äôt going to wash.</p>
<p>Trust in institutions has totally broken down. We‚Äôve been under a very precarious quarantine for more than 3 months, which almost the entire medical profession has insisted is necessary. Doctors and public health officials have castigated people on the political Right for protesting this lockdown. People have been unable to be with their loved ones in their last hours of life. They‚Äôve been unable to hold funerals for them. But now we have doctors and public officials by the thousands, signing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letters</a>, making public statements, saying it‚Äôs fine to stand shoulder to shoulder with others in the largest protests our nation has ever seen. The degree to which this has undermined confidence in public health messaging is hard to exaggerate. Whatever your politics, this has been just a mortifying piece of hypocrisy. Especially so, because the pandemic has been hitting the African American community hardest of all. How many people will die because of these protests? It‚Äôs a totally rational question to ask, but the question itself is taboo now.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that almost everything appears upside down at the moment.</p>
<p>Before I get into details on police violence, first let me try to close the door to a few misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with the proximate cause of all this: The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. I‚Äôll have more to say about this in a minute, but nothing I say should detract from the following observation: That <a href="https://youtu.be/vksEJR9EPQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> was absolutely sickening, and it revealed a degree of police negligence and incompetence and callousness that everyone was right to be horrified by. In particular, the actions of Derek Chauvin, the cop who kept his knee on Floyd‚Äôs neck for nearly 9 minutes, his actions were so reckless and so likely to cause harm that there‚Äôs no question he should be prosecuted. And he is being prosecuted. He‚Äôs been indicted for 2nd degree murder and manslaughter, and I suspect he will spend many, many years in prison. And, this is not to say ‚Äúthe system is working.‚Äù It certainly seems likely that without the cell phone video, and the public outrage, Chauvin might have gotten away with it‚Äîto say nothing of the other cops with him, who are also now being prosecuted. If this is true, we clearly need a better mechanism with which to police the police.</p>
<p>So, as I said, I‚Äôll return to this topic, because I think most people are drawing the wrong conclusions from this video, and from videos like it, but let me just echo everyone‚Äôs outrage over what happened. This is precisely the kind of police behavior that everyone should find abhorrent.</p>
<p>On the general topic of racism in America, I want to make a few similarly clear, preemptive statements:</p>
<p>Racism is still a problem in American society. No question. And slavery‚Äîwhich was racism‚Äôs most evil expression‚Äîwas this country‚Äôs founding sin. We should also add the near-total eradication of the Native Americans to that ledger of evil. Any morally sane person who learns the details of these historical injustices finds them shocking, whatever their race. And the legacy of these crimes‚Äîcrimes that were perpetrated for centuries‚Äîremains a cause for serious moral concern today. I have no doubt about this. And nothing I‚Äôm about to say, should suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an accident that the two groups I just mentioned, African Americans and Native Americans, suffer the worst from inequality in America today. How could the history of racial discrimination in this country not have had lasting effects, given the nature of that history? And if anything good comes out of the current crisis, it will be that we manage to find a new commitment to reducing inequality in all its dimensions. The real debate to have is about how to do this, economically and politically. But the status quo that many of us take for granted to is a betrayal of our values, whether we realize it or not. If it‚Äôs not a betrayal or your values now, it will be a betrayal of your values when you become a better person. And if you don‚Äôt manage that, it will be a betrayal of your kid‚Äôs values when they‚Äôre old enough to understand the world they are living in. The difference between being very lucky in our society, and very unlucky, should not be as enormous as it is.</p>
<p>However, the question that interests me, given what has been true of the past and is now true of the present, is what should we do next? What should we do to build a healthier society?</p>
<p>What should we do next?¬† Tomorrow‚Ä¶ next week‚Ä¶. Obviously, I don‚Äôt have the answers. But I am very worried that many of the things we‚Äôre doing now, and seem poised to do, will only make our problems worse. And I‚Äôm especially worried that it has become so difficult to talk about this. I‚Äôm just trying to have conversations. I‚Äôm just trying to figure these things out in real time, with other people. And there is no question that conversation itself has become dangerous.</p>
<p>Think about the politics of this. Endless imagery of people burning and looting independent businesses that were struggling to survive, and seeing the owners of these businesses beaten by mobs, cannot be good for the cause of social justice. Looting and burning businesses, and assaulting their owners, isn‚Äôt social justice, or even social protest. It‚Äôs crime. And having imagery of these crimes that highlight black involvement circulate endlessly on Fox News and on social media cannot be good for the black community. But it might yet be good for Trump.</p>
<p>And it could well kick open the door to a level of authoritarianism that many of us who have been very worried about Trump barely considered possible. It‚Äôs always seemed somewhat paranoid to me to wonder whether we‚Äôre living in Weimar Germany. I‚Äôve had many conversations about this. I had <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-road-to-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Snyder on the podcast</a>, who‚Äôs been worrying about the prospect of tyranny in the US for several years now. I‚Äôve known, in the abstract, that democracies can destroy themselves. But the idea that it could happen here still seemed totally outlandish to me. It doesn‚Äôt anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, what we‚Äôve been seeing in the streets isn‚Äôt just one thing. Some people are protesting for reasons that I fully defend. They‚Äôre outraged by specific instances of police violence, like the killing of George Floyd, and they‚Äôre worried about creeping authoritarianism‚Äîwhich we really should be worried about now. And they‚Äôre convinced that our politics is broken, because it is broken, and they are deeply concerned that our response to the pandemic and the implosion of our economy will do nothing to address the widening inequality in our society. And they recognize that we have a President who is an incompetent, divisive, conman and a crackpot at a time when we actually need wise leadership.</p>
<p>All of that is hard to put on a sign, but it‚Äôs all worth protesting.</p>
<p>However, it seems to me that most protesters are seeing this moment exclusively through the lens of identity politics‚Äîand racial politics in particular. And some of them are even celebrating the breakdown of law and order, or at least remaining nonjudgmental about it. And you could see, in the early days of this protest, news anchors take that line, on CNN, for instance. Talking about the history of social protest, ‚ÄúSometimes it has to be violent, right? What, do you think all of these protests need to be nonviolent?‚Äù Those words came out of Chris Cuomo‚Äôs mouth, and Don Lemon‚Äôs mouth. Many people have been circulating a half quote from Martin Luther King Jr. about riots being ‚Äúthe language of the unheard.‚Äù They‚Äôre <a href="https://youtu.be/pjYZZC5i_AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving out the part</a> where he made it clear that he believed riots harmed the cause of the black community and helped the cause of racists.</p>
<p>There are now calls to defund and even to abolish the police. This may be psychologically understandable when you‚Äôve spent half your day on Twitter watching videos of cops beating peaceful protesters. Those videos are infuriating. And I‚Äôll have a lot more to say about police violence in a minute. But if you think a society without cops is a society you would want to live in, you have lost your mind. Giving a monopoly on violence to the state is just about the best thing we have ever done as a species. It ranks right up there with keeping our shit out of our food. Having a police force that can deter crime, and solve crimes when they occur, and deliver violent criminals to a functioning justice system, is the necessary precondition for almost anything else of value in society.</p>
<p>We need police reform, of course. There are serious questions to ask about the culture of policing‚Äîits hiring practices, training, the militarization of so many police forces, outside oversight, how police departments deal with corruption, the way the police unions keep bad cops on the job, and yes, the problem of racist cops. But the idea that any serious person thinks we can do without the police‚Äîor that less trained and less vetted cops will magically be better than more trained and more vetted ones‚Äîthis just reveals that our conversation on these topics has run completely off the rails. Yes, we should give more resources to community services. We should have psychologists or social workers make first contact with the homeless or the mentally ill. Perhaps we‚Äôre giving cops jobs they shouldn‚Äôt be doing. All of that makes sense to rethink. But the idea that what we‚Äôre witnessing now is a matter of the cops being over-resourced‚Äîthat we‚Äôve given them too much training, that we‚Äôve made the job too attractive‚Äîso that the people we‚Äôre recruiting are of too high a quality. That doesn‚Äôt make any sense.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs been alarming here is that we‚Äôre seeing prominent people‚Äîin government, in media, in Hollywood, in sports‚Äîspeak and act as though the breakdown of civil society, and of society itself, is a form of progress and any desire for law enforcement is itself a form of racist oppression. At one point the woman who‚Äôs running the City Council in Minneapolis, which just decided to abolish the police force, was asked by a journalist, I believe on CNN, ‚ÄúWhat do I do if someone‚Äôs breaking into my house in the middle of the night? Who do I call?‚Äù And her first response to that question was, ‚ÄúYou need to recognize what a statement of privilege that question is.‚Äù She‚Äôs since had to walk that back, because it‚Äôs one of the most galling and embarrassing things a public official has ever said, but this is how close the Democratic Party is to sounding completely insane. You cannot say that if someone is breaking into your house, and you‚Äôre terrified, and you want a police force that can respond, that fear is a symptom of ‚Äúwhite privilege.‚Äù This is where Democratic politics goes to die.</p>
<p>Again, what is alarming about this is that this woke analysis of the breakdown of law and order will only encourage an increasingly authoritarian response, as well as the acceptance of that response by many millions of Americans.</p>
<p>If you step back, you will notice that there is a kind of ecstasy of ideological conformity in the air. And it‚Äôs destroying institutions. It‚Äôs destroying the very institutions we rely on to get our information‚Äîuniversities, the press. The New York Times in recent days, seems to be preparing for a self-immolation in recent days. No one wants to say or even think anything that makes anyone uncomfortable‚Äîcertainly not anyone who has more wokeness points than they do. It‚Äôs just become too dangerous. There are people <a href="https://wwos.nine.com.au/news/nba-announcer-fired-over-controversial-all-lives-matter-tweet/a9a50198-4b52-4cb7-a800-e0ffacb3302d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being fired</a> for tweeting ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter.‚Äù #AllLivesMatter, in the current environment, is being read as a naked declaration of white supremacy. That is how weird this moment is. A soccer player on the LA Galaxy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/rowdies/2020/06/05/la-galaxy-releases-player-after-wifes-racist-and-violent-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fired</a> for something his wife tweeted‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Of course, there are real problems of inequality and despair at the bottom of these protests. People who have never found a secure or satisfying place in the world‚Äîor young people who fear they never will‚Äîpeople who have seen their economic prospects simply vanish, and people who have had painful encounters with racism and racist cops‚Äîpeople by the millions are now surrendering themselves to a kind of religious awakening. But like most religious awakenings, this movement is not showing itself eager to make honest contact with reality.</p>
<p>On top of that, we find extraordinarily privileged people, whatever the color of their skin‚Äîpeople who have been living wonderful lives in their gated communities or 5<sup>th</sup> avenue apartments‚Äîand who feel damn guilty about it‚Äîthey are supporting this movement uncritically, for many reasons. Of course, they care about other people‚ÄîI‚Äôm sure most of them have the same concerns about inequality that I do‚Äîbut they are also supporting this movement because it promises a perfect expiation of their sins. If you have millions of dollars, and shoot botox into your face, and vacation on St. Bart‚Äôs, and you‚Äôre liberal‚Äîthe easiest way to sleep at night is to be as woke as AOC and like every one of her tweets.</p>
<p>The problem isn‚Äôt just with the looting, and the arson, and the violence. There are problems with these peaceful protests themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, I‚Äôm not questioning anyone‚Äôs right to protest. Even our deranged president can pay lip service to that right‚Äîwhich he did as the DC police were violently dispersing a peaceful protest so that he could get his picture taken in front of that church, awkwardly holding a bible, as though he had never held a book in life.</p>
<p>The problem with the protests is that they are animated, to a remarkable degree, by confusion and misinformation. And I‚Äôll explain why I think that‚Äôs the case. And, of course, this will be controversial. Needless to say, many people will consider the color of my skin to be disqualifying here. I could have invited any number of great, black intellectuals onto the podcast to make these points for me. But that struck me as a form of cowardice. Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Coleman Hughes, Kmele Foster, these guys might not agree with everything I‚Äôm about to say, but any one of them could walk the tightrope I‚Äôm now stepping out on far more credibly than I can.</p>
<p>But, you see, that‚Äôs part of the problem. The perception that the color of a person‚Äôs skin, or even his life experience, matters for this discussion is a pernicious illusion. For the discussion we really need to have, the color of a person‚Äôs skin, and even his life experience, simply does not matter. It cannot matter. We have to break this spell that the politics of identity has cast over everything.</p>
<p>Ok‚Ä¶</p>
<p>As I‚Äôve already acknowledged, there is a legacy of racism in the United States that we‚Äôre still struggling to outgrow. That is obvious. There are real racists out there. And there are ways in which racism became institutionalized long ago. Many of you will remember that during the crack epidemic the penalties for crack and powder cocaine were quite different. And this led black drug offenders to be locked up for much longer than white ones. Now, whether the motivation for that policy was consciously racist or not, I don‚Äôt know, but it was effectively racist. Nothing I‚Äôm about to say entails a denial of these sorts of facts. There just seems to be no question that boys who grow up with their fathers in prison start life with a significant strike against them. So criminal justice reform is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>And I‚Äôm not denying that many black people, perhaps most, have interactions with cops, and others in positions of power, or even random strangers, that seem unambiguously racist. Sometimes this is because they are actually in the presence of racism, and perhaps sometimes it only seems that way. I‚Äôve had unpleasant encounters with cops, and customs officers, and TSA screeners, and bureaucrats of every kind, and even with people working in stores or restaurants. People aren‚Äôt always nice or ethical. But being white, and living in a majority white society, I‚Äôve never had to worry about whether any of these collisions were the result of racism. And I can well imagine that in some of these situations, had I been black, I would have come away feeling that I had encountered yet another racist in the wild. So I consider myself very lucky to have gone through life not having to think about any of that. Surely that‚Äôs one form of white privilege.</p>
<p>So, nothing I‚Äôm going to say denies that we should condemn racism‚Äîwhether interpersonal or institutional‚Äîand we should condemn it wherever we find it. But as a society, we simply can‚Äôt afford to find and condemn racism where it doesn‚Äôt exist. And we should be increasingly aware of the costs of doing that. The more progress we make on issues of race, the less racism there will be to find, and the more likely we‚Äôll find ourselves chasing after its ghost.</p>
<p>The truth is, we have made considerable progress on the problem of racism in America. This isn‚Äôt 1920, and it isn‚Äôt 1960. We had a two-term black president. We have black congressmen and women. We have black mayors and black chiefs of police. There are major cities, like Detroit and Atlanta, going on their fifth or sixth consecutive black mayor. Having more and more black people in positions of real power, in what is still a majority white society, is progress on the problem of racism. And the truth is, it might not even solve the problem we‚Äôre talking about. When Freddy Gray was killed in Baltimore, virtually everyone who could have been held accountable for his death was black. The problem of police misconduct and reform is complicated, as we‚Äôre about to see. But obviously, there is more work to do on the problem of racism. And, more important, there is much more work to do to remedy the inequalities in our society that are so correlated with race, and will still be correlated with race, even after the last racist has been driven from our shores.</p>
<p>The question of how much of today‚Äôs inequality is due to existing racism‚Äîwhether racist people or racist policies‚Äîis a genuinely difficult question to answer. And to answer it, we need to distinguish the past from the present.</p>
<p>Take wealth inequality, for example: The median white family has a net worth of around $170,000‚Äîthese data are a couple of years old, but they‚Äôre probably pretty close to what‚Äôs true now. The median black family has a net worth of around $17,000. So we have a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/06/18/a-conversation-about-the-racial-wealth-gap-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenfold difference in median wealth</a>. (That‚Äôs the median, not the mean: Half of white families are below 170,000 and half above; half of black families are below 17,000 and half above. And we‚Äôre talking about wealth here, not income.)</p>
<p>This disparity in wealth persists even for people whose incomes are in the top 10 percent of the income distribution. For whites in the top 10 percent for income, the median net worth is $1.8 million; for blacks it‚Äôs around $350,000. There are probably many things that account for this disparity in wealth. It seems that black families that make it to the top of the income distribution fall out of it more easily than white families do. But it‚Äôs also undeniable that black families have less intergenerational wealth accumulated through inheritance.</p>
<p>How much of this is inequality due to the legacy of slavery? And how much of it is due to an ensuing century of racist policies? I‚Äôm prepared to believe quite a lot. And it strikes me as totally legitimate to think about paying reparations as a possible remedy here. Of course, one will then need to talk about reparations for the Native Americans. And then one wonders where this all ends. And what about blacks who aren‚Äôt descended from slaves, but who still suffered the consequences of racism in the US? In listening to people like <a href="https://youtu.be/FXt9Q5h1sCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McWhorter</a> and Coleman Hughes discuss this topic, I‚Äôm inclined to think that reparations is probably unworkable as a policy. But the truth is that I‚Äôm genuinely unsure about this.</p>
<p>Whatever we decide about the specific burdens of the past, we have to ask, how much of current wealth inequality is due to existing racism and to existing policies that make it harder for black families to build wealth? And the only way to get answers to those questions is to have a dispassionate discussion about facts.</p>
<p>The problem with the social activism we are now seeing‚Äîwhat John McWhorter has called ‚Äúthe new religion of anti-Racism‚Äù‚Äîis that it finds racism nearly everywhere, even where it manifestly does not exist. And this is incredibly damaging to the cause of achieving real equality in our society. It‚Äôs almost impossible to exaggerate the evil and injustice of slavery and its aftermath. But it is possible to exaggerate how much racism currently exists at an Ivy League university, or in Silicon Valley, or at the Oscars. And those exaggerations are toxic‚Äîand, perversely, they may produce more real racism. It seems to me that false claims of victimhood can diminish the social stature of any group, even a group that has a long history of real victimization.</p>
<p>The imprecision here‚Äîthe bad-faith arguments, the double standards, the goal-post shifting, the <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hrFzz1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idiotic opinion pieces</a> in the New York Times, the defenestrations on social media, the general hysteria that the cult of wokeness has produced‚ÄîI think this is all extremely harmful to civil society, and to effective liberal politics, and to the welfare of African Americans.</p>
<p>So, with that as preamble, let‚Äôs return to the tragic death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>As I said, I believe that any sane person who watches that video will feel that they have witnessed a totally unjustified killing. So, people of any race, are right to be horrified by what happened there. But now I want to ask a few questions, and I want us to try to consider them dispassionately. And I really want you to watch your mind while you do this. There are very likely to be few tripwires installed there, and I‚Äôm about to hit them. So just do your best to remain calm.</p>
<p>Does the killing of George Floyd prove that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>Does it even suggest that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>In other words, do we have reason to believe that, had Floyd been white, he wouldn‚Äôt have died in a similar way?</p>
<p>Do the dozen or so other videos that have emerged in recent years, of black men being killed by cops, do they prove, or even suggest, that there is an epidemic of lethal police violence directed especially at black men and that this violence is motivated by racism?</p>
<p>Most people seem to think that the answers to these questions are so obvious that to even pose them as I just did is obscene. The answer is YES, and it‚Äôs a yes that now needs to be shouted in the streets.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that if you take even 5 minutes to look at the data on crime and police violence, the answer appears to be ‚Äúno,‚Äù in every case, albeit with one important caveat. I‚Äôm not talking about how the police behaved in 1970 or even 1990. But in the last 25 years, violent crime has come down significantly in the US, and so has the police use of deadly force. And as you‚Äôre about to see, the police used more deadly force against white people‚Äîboth in absolute numbers, and in terms of their contribution to crime and violence in our society. But the public perception is, of course, completely different.</p>
<p>In a city like Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-12/lapd-use-of-force-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 was a 30-year low</a> for police shootings. Think about that‚Ä¶. Do the people who were protesting in Los Angeles, peacefully and violently, do the people who were ransacking and burning businesses by the hundreds‚Äîin many cases, businesses that will not return to their neighborhoods‚Äîdo the people who caused so much damage to the city, that certain neighborhoods, ironically the neighborhoods that are disproportionately black, will take years, probably decades to recover, do the celebrities who supported them, and even bailed them out of jail‚Äîdo any of these people know that 2019 was the 30-year low for police shootings in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Before I step out further over the abyss here, let me reiterate: Many of you are going to feel a visceral negative reaction to what I‚Äôm about to say. You‚Äôre not going to like the way it sounds. You‚Äôre especially not going to like the way it sounds coming from a white guy. This feeling of not liking, this feeling of outrage, this feeling of disgust‚Äîthis feeling of ‚ÄúSam, what the fuck is wrong with you, why are you even touching this topic?‚Äù‚Äîthis feeling isn‚Äôt an argument. It isn‚Äôt, or shouldn‚Äôt be, the basis for your believing anything to be true or false about the world.</p>
<p>Your capacity to be offended isn‚Äôt something that I or anyone else needs to respect. Your capacity to be offended isn‚Äôt something that you should respect. In fact, it is something that you should be on your guard for. Perhaps more than any other property of your mind, this feeling can mislead you.</p>
<p>If you care about justice‚Äîand you absolutely should‚Äîyou should care about facts and the ability to discuss them openly. Justice requires contact with reality. It simply isn‚Äôt the case‚Äîit cannot be the case‚Äîthat the most pressing claims on our sense of justice need come from those who claim to be the most offended by conversation itself.</p>
<p>So, I‚Äôm going to speak the language of facts right now, in so far as we know them, all the while knowing that these facts run very much counter to most people‚Äôs assumptions. Many of the things you think you know about crime and violence in our society are almost certainly wrong. And that should matter to you.</p>
<p>So just take a moment and think this through with me.</p>
<p>How many people are killed each year in America by cops? If you don‚Äôt know, guess. See if you have any intuitions for these numbers. Because your intuitions are determining how you interpret horrific videos of the sort we saw coming out of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The answer for many years running is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 1000</a>. One thousand people are killed by cops in America each year. There are about 50 to 60 million encounters between civilians and cops each year, and <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 10 million arrests</a>. That‚Äôs down from a high of over 14 million arrests annually throughout the 1990‚Äôs. So, of the 10 million occasions where a person attracts the attention of the police, and the police decide to make an arrest, about 1000 of those people die as a result. (I‚Äôm sure a few people get killed even when no arrest was attempted, but that has to be a truly tiny number.) So, without knowing anything else about the situation, if the cops decide to arrest you, it would be reasonable to think that your chance of dying is around 1/10,000. Of course, in the United States, it‚Äôs higher than it is in other countries. So I‚Äôm not saying that this number is acceptable. But it is what it is for a reason, as we‚Äôre about to see.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few generic things I‚Äôd like to point here before we get further into the data. They should be uncontroversial.</p>
<p>First, it‚Äôs almost certainly the case that of these 1000 officer-caused deaths each year, some are entirely justified‚Äîit may even be true that most are entirely justified‚Äîand some are entirely unjustified, and some are much harder to judge. And that will be true next year. And the year after that.</p>
<p>Of the unjustified killings, there are vast differences between them. Many have nothing in common but for the fact that a cop killed someone unnecessarily. It might have been a terrible misunderstanding, or incompetence, or just bad luck, and in certain cases it could be a cop who decides to murder someone because he‚Äôs become enraged, or he‚Äôs just a psychopath. And it is certainly possible that racial bias accounts for some number of these unjustified killings.</p>
<p>Another point that should be uncontroversial‚Äîbut may sound a little tone-deaf in the current environment, where we‚Äôve inundated with videos of police violence in response to these protests. But this has to be acknowledged whenever we‚Äôre discussing this topic: Cops have a very hard job. In fact, in the current environment, they have an almost impossible job.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre making 10 million arrests every year, some number of people will decide not to cooperate. There can be many reasons for this. A person could be mentally ill, or drunk, or on drugs. Of course, rather often the person is an actual criminal who doesn‚Äôt want to be arrested.</p>
<p>Among innocent people, and perhaps this getting more common these days, a person might feel that resisting arrest is the right thing to do, ethically or politically or as a matter of affirming his identity. After all, put yourself in his shoes, he did nothing wrong. Why are the cops arresting him? I don‚Äôt know if we have data on the numbers of people who resist arrest by race. But I can well imagine that if it‚Äôs common for African Americans to believe that the only reason they have been singled out for arrest is due to racism on the part of the police, that could lead to greater levels of non-compliance. Which seems very likely to lead to more unnecessary injury and death. This is certainly one reason why it is wise to have the racial composition of a police force mirror that of the community it‚Äôs policing. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no evidence that this will reduce lethal violence from the side of the police. In fact, the evidence we have suggests that black and Hispanic cops are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. But it would surely change the perception of the community that racism is a likely explanation for police behavior, which itself might reduce conflict.</p>
<p>When a cop goes hands on a person in an attempt to control his movements or make an arrest, that person‚Äôs resistance poses a problem that most people don‚Äôt understand. If you haven‚Äôt studied this topic. If you don‚Äôt know what it physically takes to restrain and immobilize a non-compliant person who may be bigger and stronger than you are, and if you haven‚Äôt thought through the implications of having a gun on your belt while attempting to do that‚Äîa gun that can be grabbed and used against you, or against a member of the public‚Äîthen your intuitions about what makes sense here, tactically and ethically, are very likely to be bad.</p>
<p>If you haven‚Äôt trained with firearms under stress. If you don‚Äôt know how suddenly situations can change. If you haven‚Äôt experienced how quickly another person can close the distance on you, and how little time you have to decide to draw your weapon. If you don‚Äôt know how hard it is to shoot a moving target, or even a stationary one, when your heart is beating out of your chest. You very likely have totally unreasonable ideas about what we can expect from cops in situations like these. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwWado4SVY&amp;bpctr=1592453276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbOLb0O7Pw&amp;bpctr=1592455027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_87GBOCVYTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]</p>
<p>And there is another fact that looms over all this like the angel of Death, literally: Most cops do not get the training they need. They don‚Äôt get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQLOmfx8X_E&amp;feature=emb_title">hand-to-hand training</a> they need‚Äîthey don‚Äôt have good skills to subdue people without harming them. All you need to do is watch YouTube videos of botched arrests to see this. The martial arts community stands in perpetual astonishment at <a href="https://youtu.be/F4VeHOkt_o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kinds of things cops do and fail to do</a> once they start fighting with suspects. Cops also don‚Äôt get the firearms training they need. Of course, there are elite units in many police departments, but most cops do not have the training they need to do the job they‚Äôre being asked to do.</p>
<p>It is also true, no doubt, that some cops are racist bullies. And there are corrupt police departments that cover for these guys, and cover up police misconduct generally, whether it was borne of racism or not.</p>
<p>But the truth is that even if we got rid of all bad cops, which we absolutely should do, and there were only good people left, and we got all these good people the best possible training, and we gave them the best culture in which to think about their role in society, and we gave them the best methods for de-escalating potentially violent situations‚Äîwhich we absolutely must do‚Äîand we scrubbed all the dumb laws from our books, so that when cops were required to enforce the law, they were only risking their lives and the lives of civilians for reasons that we deem necessary and just‚Äîso the war on drugs is obviously over‚Äîeven under these conditions of perfect progress, we are still guaranteed to have some number of cases each year where a cop kills a civilian in a way that is totally unjustified, and therefore tragic. Every year, there will be some number of families who will be able to say that the cops killed their son or daughter, or father or mother, or brother or sister. And videos of these killings will occasionally surface, and they will be horrific. This seems guaranteed to happen.</p>
<p>So, while we need to make all these improvements, we still need to understand that there are very likely always to going to be videos of cops doing something inexplicable, or inexplicably stupid, that results in an innocent person‚Äôs death, or a not-so-innocent person‚Äôs death. And sometimes the cop will be white and the victim will be black. We have 10 million arrests each year. And we now live in a panopticon where practically everything is videotaped.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm about to get further into the details of what we know about police violence, but I want to just put it to you now: If we‚Äôre going to let the health of race relations in this country, or the relationship between the community and the police, depend on whether we ever see a terrible video of police misconduct again, the project of healing these wounds in our society is doomed.</p>
<p>About a week into these protests I heard Van Jones on CNN say, ‚ÄúIf we see one more video of a cop brutalizing a black man, this country could go over the edge.‚Äù He said this, not as indication of how dangerously inflamed people have become. He seemed to be saying it as an ultimatum to the police. With 10 million arrests a year, arrests that have to take place in the most highly armed society in the developed world, I hope you understand how unreasonable that ultimatum is.</p>
<p>We have to put these videos into context. And we have to acknowledge how different they are from one another. Some of them are easy to interpret. But some are quite obviously being interpreted incorrectly by most people‚Äîespecially by activists. And there are a range of cases‚Äîsome have video associated with them and some don‚Äôt‚Äîthat are now part of a litany of anti-racist outrage, and the names of the dead are intoned as though they were all evidence of the same injustice. And yet, they are not.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XKQqgVlk0NQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Scott</a> was stopped for a broken taillight and got out of his car and tried to flee. There might have been a brief struggle over the officer‚Äôs taser, that part of the video isn‚Äôt clear. But what is clear is that he was shot in the back multiple times as he was running away. That was insane. There was zero reason for the officer to feel that his life was under threat at the point he opened fire. And for that unjustified shooting, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs long enough. That seemed like straight-up murder.</p>
<p>The George Floyd video, while even more disturbing to watch, is harder to interpret. I don‚Äôt know anything about Derek Chauvin, the cop who knelt on his neck. It‚Äôs quite possible that he‚Äôs a terrible person who should have never been a cop. He seems to have a significant number of complaints against him‚Äîthough, as far as I know, the details of those complaints haven‚Äôt been released. And he might be a racist on top of being a bad cop. Or he might be a guy who was totally in over his head and thought you could restrain someone indefinitely by keeping a knee on their neck indefinitely. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm sure more facts will come out. But whoever he is, I find it very unlikely that he was intending to kill George Floyd. Think about it. He was surrounded by irate witnesses and being filmed. Unless he was aspiring to become the most notorious murderer in human history, it seems very unlikely that he was intending to commit murder in that moment. It‚Äôs possible, of course. But it doesn‚Äôt seem the likeliest explanation for his behavior.</p>
<p>What I believe we saw on that video was the result of a tragic level of negligence and poor training on the part of those cops. Or terrible recruitment‚Äîit‚Äôs possible that none of these guys should have ever been cops. I think for one of them, it was only his fourth day on the job. Just imagine that. Just imagine all things you don‚Äôt know as a new cop.¬† It could also be a function of bad luck in terms of Floyd‚Äôs underlying health. It‚Äôs been reported that he was complaining of being unable to breath before Chauvin pinned him with his knee. The knee on his neck might not have been the only thing that caused his death. It could have also been the weight of the other officer pinning him down.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly what happened in the cast of Eric Garner. Half the people on earth believe they witnessed a cop choke Eric Garner to death in that video. That does not appear to be what happened. When Eric Garner is saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äù he‚Äôs not being choked. He‚Äôs being held down on the pavement by several officers. Being forced down on your stomach under the weight of several people can kill a person, especially someone with lung or heart disease. In the case of Eric Garner, it is absolutely clear that the cop who briefly attempted to choke him was no longer choking him. If you doubt that, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/Nql1xRtWKOU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> again.</p>
<p>And if you are recoiling now from my interpretation of these videos, you really should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_c-E_i8Q5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the killing of Tony Timpa</a>. It‚Äôs also terribly disturbing, but it removes the variable of race and it removes any implication of intent to harm on the part of the cops about as clearly as you could ask. It really is worth watching as a corrective to our natural interpretation of these other videos.</p>
<p>Tony Timpa was a white man in Dallas, who was suffering some mental health emergency and cocaine intoxication. And he actually called 911 himself. What we see is the bodycam footage from the police, which shows that he was already in handcuffs when they arrived‚Äîa security guard had cuffed him. And then the cops take over, and they restrain Timpa on the ground, by rolling him onto a stomach and putting their weight on him, very much like in the case of Eric Garner. And they keep their weight on him‚Äîone cop has a knee on his upper back, which is definitely much less aggressive than a knee on the neck‚Äîbut they crush the life out of him all the same, over the course of 13 minutes. He‚Äôs not being choked. The cops are not being rough. There‚Äôs no animus between them and Timpa. It was not a hostile arrest. They clearly believe that they‚Äôre responding to a mental health emergency. But they keep him down on his belly, under their weight, and they‚Äôre cracking jokes as he loses consciousness. Now, your knowledge that he‚Äôs going to be dead by the end of this video, make their jokes seem pretty callous. But this was about as benign an imposition of force by cops as you‚Äôre going to see. The crucial insight you will have watching this video, is that the officers not only had no intent to kill Tony Timpa, they don‚Äôt take his pleading seriously because they have no doubt that what they‚Äôre doing is perfectly safe‚Äîperfectly within protocol. They‚Äôve probably done this hundreds of times before.</p>
<p>If you watch that video‚Äîand, again, fair warning, it is disturbing‚Äîbut imagine how disturbing it would have been to our society if Tony Timpa had been black. If the only thing you changed about the video was the color of Timpa‚Äôs skin, then that video would have detonated like a nuclear bomb in our society, exactly as the George Floyd video did. In fact, in one way it is worse, or would have been perceived to be worse. I mean, just imagine white cops telling jokes as they crushed the life out of a black Tony Timpa‚Ä¶ Given the nature of our conversation about violence, given the way we perceive videos of this kind, there is no way that people would have seen that as anything other than a lynching. And yet, it would not have been a lynching.</p>
<p>Now, I obviously have no idea what was in the minds of cops in Minneapolis. And perhaps we‚Äôll learn at trial. Perhaps a tape of Chauvin using the N-word in another context will surface, bringing in a credible allegation of racism. It seems to me that Chauvin is going to have a very hard time making sense of his actions. But most people who saw that video believe they have seen, with their own eyes, beyond any possibility of doubt, a racist cop intentionally murder an innocent man. That‚Äôs not what the video necessarily shows.</p>
<p>As I said, these videos can be hard to interpret, even while seeming very easy to interpret. And these cases, whether we have associated video or not, are very different. Michael Brown is reported to have punched a cop in the face and attempted to get his gun. As far as I know, there‚Äôs no video of that encounter. But, if true, that is an entirely different situation. If you‚Äôre attacking a cop, trying to get his gun, that is a life and death struggle that almost by definition for the cop, and it most cases justifies the use of lethal force. And honestly, it seems that no one within a thousand miles of Black Lives Matter is willing to make these distinctions. An attitude of anti-racist moral outrage is not the best lens through which to interpret evidence of police misconduct.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen many videos of people getting arrested. And I‚Äôve seen the outraged public reaction to what appears to be inappropriate use of force by the cops. One overwhelming fact that comes through is that people, whatever the color of their skin, don‚Äôt understand how to behave around cops so as to keep themselves safe. People have to stop resisting arrest. This may seem obvious, but judging from most of these videos, and from the public reaction to them, this must be a totally arcane piece of information. When a cop wants to take you into custody, you don‚Äôt get to decide whether or not you should be arrested. When a cop wants to take you into custody, for whatever reason, it‚Äôs not a negotiation. And if you turn it into a wrestling match, you‚Äôre very likely to get injured or killed.</p>
<p>This is a point I once belabored in a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/racism-and-violence-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast with Glenn Loury</a>, and it became essentially a public service announcement. And I‚Äôve gone back and listened to those comments, and I want to repeat them here. This is something that everyone really needs to understand. And it‚Äôs something that Black Lives Matter should be teaching explicitly: If you put your hands on a cop‚Äîif you start wrestling with a cop, or grabbing him because he‚Äôs arresting your friend, or pushing him, or striking him, or using your hands in way that can possibly be interpreted as your reaching for a gun‚Äîyou are likely to get shot in the United States, whatever the color of your skin.</p>
<p>As I said, when you‚Äôre with a cop, there is always a gun out in the open. And any physical struggle has to be perceived by him as a fight for the gun. A cop doesn‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre going to do if you overpower him, so he has to assume the worst. Most cops are not confident in their ability to physically control a person without shooting him‚Äîfor good reason, because they‚Äôre not well trained to do that, and they‚Äôre continually confronting people who are bigger, or younger, or more athletic, or more aggressive than they are. Cops are not superheroes. They‚Äôre ordinary people with insufficient training, and once things turn physical they cannot afford to give a person who is now assaulting a police officer the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>This is something that most people seem totally confused about. If they see a video of somebody trying to punch a cop in the face and the person‚Äôs unarmed, many people think the cop should just punch back, and any use of deadly force would be totally disproportionate. But that‚Äôs not how violence works. It‚Äôs not the cop‚Äôs job to be the best bare-knuckled boxer on Earth so he doesn‚Äôt have to use his gun. A cop can‚Äôt risk getting repeatedly hit in the face and knocked out, because there‚Äôs always a gun in play. This is the cop‚Äôs perception of the world, and it‚Äôs a justifiable one, given the dynamics of human violence.</p>
<p>You might think cops shouldn‚Äôt carry guns. Why can‚Äôt we just be like England? That‚Äôs a point that can be debated. But it requires considerable thought in a country where there are over 300 million guns on the street. The United States is not England.</p>
<p>Again, really focus on what is happening when a cop is attempting to arrest a person. It‚Äôs not up to you to decide whether or not you should be arrested. Does it matter that you know you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong? No. And how could that fact be effectively communicated in the moment by your not following police commands? I‚Äôm going to ask that again: How could the fact that you‚Äôre innocent, that you‚Äôre not a threat to cop, that you‚Äôre not about to suddenly attack him or produce a weapon of your own, how could those things be effectively communicated at the moment he‚Äôs attempting to arrest you by your resisting arrest?</p>
<p>Unless you called the cops yourself, you never know what situation you‚Äôre in. If I‚Äôm walking down the street, I don‚Äôt know if the cop who is approaching me didn‚Äôt get a call that some guy who looks like Ben Stiller just committed an armed robbery. I know I didn‚Äôt do anything, but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in the cop‚Äôs head. The time to find out what‚Äôs going on‚Äîthe time to complain about racist cops, the time to yell at them and tell them they‚Äôre all going to get fired for their stupidity and misconduct‚Äîis after cooperating, at the police station, in the presence of a lawyer, preferably. But to not comply in the heat of the moment, when a guy with the gun is issuing commands‚Äîthis raises your risk astronomically, and it‚Äôs something that most people, it seems, just do not intuitively understand, even when they‚Äôre not in the heat of the moment themselves, but just watching video of other people getting arrested.</p>
<p>Ok. End of public-service announcement.</p>
<p>The main problem with using individual cases, where black men and women have been killed by cops, to conclude that there is an epidemic of racist police violence in our society, is that you can find nearly identical cases of white suspects being killed by cops, and there are actually more of them.</p>
<p>In 2016, John McWhorter wrote a <a href="https://time.com/4404987/police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> in Time Magazine about this.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a snippet of what he wrote:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe heart of the indignation over these murders is a conviction that racist bias plays a decisive part in these encounters. That has seemed plausible to me, and I have recently challenged those who disagree to present a list of white people killed within the past few years under circumstances similar to those that so enrage us in cases such as what happened to Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Walter Scott, Sam Debose, and others.‚Äù</p>
<p>So, McWhorter issued that challenge, as he said, and he was presented with the cases [<a href="https://youtu.be/EPxNUKw0kV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/VBUUx0jUKxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6KhRcIOuurI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]. But there‚Äôs no song about these people, admonishing us to say their names. And the list of white names is longer, and I don‚Äôt know any of them, other than Tony Timpa. I know the black names. In addition to the ones I just read from McWhorter‚Äôs article, I know the names of Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, and Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile, and now, of course, I know the name of George Floyd. And I‚Äôm aware of many of the details of these cases where black men and women have been killed by cops. I know the name of Breonna Taylor. I can‚Äôt name a single white person killed by cops in circumstances like these‚Äîother than Timpa‚Äîand I just read McWhorter‚Äôs article where he lists many of them.</p>
<p>So, this is also a distortion in the media. The media is not showing us videos of white people being killed by cops; activists are not demanding that they do this. I‚Äôm sure white supremacists talk about this stuff a lot, who knows? But in terms of the story we‚Äôre telling ourselves in the mainstream, we are not actually talking about the data on lethal police violence.</p>
<p>So back to the data: Again, cops kill around 1000 people every year in the United States. About 25 percent are black. About 50 percent are white. The data on police homicide are all over the place. The federal government does not have a single repository for data of this kind. But they have been pretty carefully tracked by outside sources, like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, for the last 5 years. These ratios appear stable over time. Again, many of these killings are justifiable, we‚Äôre talking about career criminals who are often armed and, in many cases, trying to kill the cops. Those aren‚Äôt the cases we‚Äôre worried about. We‚Äôre worried about the unjustifiable homicides.</p>
<p>Now, some people will think that these numbers still represent an outrageous injustice. Afterall, African Americans are only 13 percent of the population. So, at most, they should be 13 percent of the victims of police violence, not 25 percent. Any departure from the baseline population must be due to racism.</p>
<p>Ok. Well, that sounds plausible, but consider a few more facts:</p>
<p>Blacks are 13 percent of the population, but they commit <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 50 percent</a> of the murders and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883">other violent crimes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have 13 percent of the population responsible for 50 percent of the murders‚Äîand in some cities committing 2/3rds of all violent crime‚Äîwhat percent of police attention should it attract? I don‚Äôt know. But I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not just 13 percent. Given that the overwhelming majority of their victims are black, I‚Äôm pretty sure that most black people wouldn‚Äôt set the dial at 13 percent either.</p>
<p>And here we arrive at the core of the problem. The story of crime in America is overwhelmingly the story of black-on-black crime. It is also, in part, a story of black-on-white crime. For more than a generation, crime in America really hasn‚Äôt been a story of much white-on-black crime. [Some listeners mistook my meaning here. I‚Äôm not denying that most violent crime is intraracial. So, it‚Äôs true that most white homicide victims are killed by white offenders. Per capita, however, the white crime rate is much lower than the black crime rate. And there is more black-on-white crime than white-on-black crime.‚ÄîSH]</p>
<p>The murder rate has come down steadily since the early 1990‚Äôs, with only minor upticks. But, nationwide, blacks are still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 times more likely</a> to get murdered than whites, and in some cities their risk is double that. And <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/wiener/programs/pcj/files/PoliceandPublicDiscourseBlackonBlackViolence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 95 percent</a> of the murders are committed by members of the African American community. [While reported in 2015, these data were more than a decade old. Looking at more recent data from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI‚Äôs Uniform Crime Report</a>, the number appears to be closer to 90 percent.‚ÄîSH]</p>
<p>The weekend these protests and riots were kicking off nationwide‚Äîwhen our entire country seemed to be tearing itself apart over a perceived epidemic of racist police violence against the black community, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-sees-18-homicides-deadliest-day-60-years/story?id=71150234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">92 people were shot, and 27 killed</a>, in Chicago alone‚Äîone city. This is almost entirely a story of black men killing members of their own community. And this is far more representative of the kind of violence that the black community needs to worry about. And, ironically, it‚Äôs clear that one remedy for this violence is, or would be, effective policing.</p>
<p>These are simply the facts of crime in our society as we best understand them. And the police have to figure out how to respond to these facts, professionally and ethically. The question is, are they doing that? And, obviously, there‚Äôs considerable doubt that they‚Äôre doing that, professionally and ethically.</p>
<p>Roland Fryer, the Harvard economist who‚Äôs work I discussed on the podcast with Glenn Loury, studied police encounters involving black and white suspects and the use of force.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> is titled, this from 2016, ‚ÄúAn Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fryer is black, and he went into this research with the expectation that the data would confirm that there‚Äôs an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at black men. But he didn‚Äôt find that. However, he did find support for the suspicion that black people suffer more nonlethal violence at the hands of cops than whites do.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs look at this.</p>
<p>The study examined data from 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida and California. Generally, Fryer found that there is 25 percent greater likelihood that the police would go hands on black suspects than white ones‚Äîcuffing them, or forcing them to ground, or using other non-lethal force.</p>
<p>Specifically, in New York City, in encounters where white and black citizens were matched for other characteristics, they found that:</p>
<p>Cops were‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>17 percent more likely to go hands on black suspects</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them into a wall</li>
<li>16 percent more likely to put them in handcuffs (in a situation in which they aren‚Äôt arrested)</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them to the ground</li>
<li>25 percent more likely to use pepper spray or a baton</li>
<li>19 percent more likely to draw their guns</li>
<li>24 percent more likely to point a gun at them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more or less the full continuum of violence short of using lethal force. And it seems, from the data we have, that blacks receive more of it than whites. What accounts for this disparity? Racism? Maybe. However, as I said, it‚Äôs inconvenient to note that other data suggest that black cops and Hispanic cops are more likely to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. I‚Äôm not sure how an ambient level of racism explains that.</p>
<p>Are there other explanations? Well, again, could it be that blacks are less cooperative with the police. If so, that‚Äôs worth understanding. A culture of resisting arrest would be a very bad thing to cultivate, given that the only response to such resistance is for the police to increase their use of force.</p>
<p>Whatever is true here is something we should want to understand. And it‚Äôs all too easy to see how an increased number of encounters with cops, due to their policing in the highest crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black, and an increased number of traffic stops in those neighborhoods, and an increased propensity for cops to go hands-on these suspects, with or without an arrest, for whatever reason‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to see how all of this could be the basis for a perception of racism, whether or not racism is the underlying motivation.</p>
<p>It is totally humiliating to be arrested or manhandled by a cop. And, given the level of crime in the black community, a disproportionate number of innocent black men seem guaranteed to have this experience. It‚Äôs totally understandable that this would make them bitter and mistrustful of the police. This is another vicious circle that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>But Fryer also found that black suspects are around 25 percent less likely to be shot than white suspects are. And in the most egregious situations, where officers were not first attacked, but nevertheless fired their weapons at a suspect, they were more likely to do this when the suspect was white.</p>
<p>Again, the data are incomplete. This doesn‚Äôt not cover every city in the country. And a larger study tomorrow might paint a different picture. But, as far as I know, the best data we have suggest that for, whatever reason, whites are more likely to be killed by cops once an arrest is attempted. And a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more recent study</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences¬† by David Johnson and colleagues found similar results. And it is simply undeniable that more whites are killed by cops each year, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to their contributions to crime and violence in our society.</p>
<p>Can you hear how these facts should be grinding in that well-oiled machine of woke outrage? Our society is in serious trouble now. We are being crushed under the weight of a global pandemic and our response to it has been totally inept. On top of that, we‚Äôre being squeezed by the growing pressure of what might become a full-on economic depression. And the streets are now filled with people who imagine, on the basis of seeing some horrific videos, that there is an epidemic of racist cops murdering African Americans. Look at what this belief is doing to our politics. And these videos will keep coming. And the truth is they could probably be matched 2 for 1 with videos of white people being killed by cops. What percentage of people protesting understand that the disparity runs this way? In light of the belief that the disparity must run the other way, people are now quite happy to risk getting beaten and arrested by cops themselves, and to even loot and burn businesses. And most people and institutions are supporting this civil unrest from the sidelines, because they too imagine that cops are killing black people in extraordinary numbers. And all of this is calling forth an authoritarian response from Trump‚Äîand leading to more examples of police violence caught on video.</p>
<p>As I hope I‚Äôve made clear, we need police reform‚Äîthere‚Äôs no question about this. And some of the recent footage of the police attacking peaceful protests is outrageous. Nothing I just said should signify that I‚Äôm unaware of that. From what I‚Äôve seen‚Äîand by the time I release this podcast, the character of all this might have changed‚Äîbut, from what I‚Äôve seen, the police were dangerously passive in the face of looting and real crime, at least in the beginning. In many cities, they just stood and watched society unravel. And then they were far too aggressive in the face of genuinely peaceful protests. This is a terrible combination. It is the worst combination. There‚Äôs no better way to increase cynicism and anger and fear, on all sides.</p>
<p>But racializing how we speak about the problem of police violence, where race isn‚Äôt actually the relevant variable‚Äîagain, think of Tony Timpa‚Äî this has highly negative effects. First, it keeps us from talking about the real problems with police tactics. For instance, we had the recent case of Breonna Taylor who was killed in a so-called ‚Äúno knock‚Äù raid of her home. As occasionally happens, in this carnival of moral error we call ‚Äúthe war on drugs,‚Äù the police had the wrong address, and they kicked in the wrong door. And they wound up killing a totally innocent woman. But this had nothing to do with race. The problem is not, as some commentators have alleged, that it‚Äôs not safe to be ‚Äúsleeping while black.‚Äù The problem is that these no-knock raids are an obscenely dangerous way of enforcing despicably stupid laws. White people die under precisely these same circumstances, and very likely in greater numbers (I don‚Äôt have data specifically on no-knock raids, but we can assume that the ratio is probably conserved here).</p>
<p>Think about how crazy this policy is in a nation where gun ownership is so widespread. If someone kicks in your door in the middle of the night, and you‚Äôre a gun owner, of course you‚Äôre going to reach for your gun. That‚Äôs why you have a gun in the first place. The fact that people bearing down on you and your family out of the darkness might have yelled ‚Äúpolice‚Äù (or might have not yelled ‚Äúpolice‚Äù; it‚Äôs alleged in some of these cases that they don‚Äôt yell anything)‚Äîthe fact that someone yells ‚Äúpolice‚Äù isn‚Äôt necessarily convincing. Anyone can yell ‚Äúpolice.‚Äù And, again, think of the psychology of this: If the police have the wrong house, and you know there is no reason on earth that real cops would take an interest in you, especially in the middle of the night, because you haven‚Äôt done anything (you‚Äôre not the guy running a meth lab)‚Äîand now you‚Äôre reaching for your gun in the dark‚Äîof course, someone is likely to get killed. This is not a racial issue. It‚Äôs a terrible policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process of police reform isn‚Äôt straightforward‚Äîand it is made massively more complicated by what‚Äôs happening now. Yes, we will be urging police reform in a very big way now, that much seems clear. But Roland Fryer <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also shown</a> that investigations of the cops, in a climate where viral videos and racial politics are operating, have dramatic effects, many of which are negative.</p>
<p>He studied the aftermath of the investigations into police misconduct that followed the killings Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, and Lequan McDonald, and found that, for reasons that seem pretty easy to intuit, proactive police contact with civilians decreases drastically, sometimes by as much 100 percent, once these investigations get started. This is now called ‚ÄúThe Ferguson Effect.‚Äù The police still answer 911 calls, but they don‚Äôt investigate suspicious activity in the same way. They don‚Äôt want to wind up on YouTube. And when they alter their behavior like this, homicides go up. Fryer estimates that the effects of these few investigations translated into 1000 extra homicides, and almost 40,000 more felonies, over the next 24 months in the US. And, of course, most of the victims of those crimes were black. One shudders to imagine the size of the Ferguson effect we‚Äôre about to see nationwide‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure the morale among cops has never been lower. I think it‚Äôs almost guaranteed that cops by the thousands will be leaving the force. And it will be much more difficult to recruit good people.</p>
<p>Who is going to want to be a cop now? Who could be idealist about occupying that role in society? It seems to me that the population of people who will become cops now will be more or less indistinguishable from the population of people who become prison guards. I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a difference there, and I think we‚Äôre likely to see that difference expressed in the future. It‚Äôs a grim picture, unless we do something very creative here.</p>
<p>So there‚Äôs a real question about how we can reform police departments, and get rid of bad cops, without negatively impacting the performance of good cops? That‚Äôs a riddle we have to solve‚Äîor at least we have to understand what the trade-offs are here.</p>
<p>Why is all of this happening now? Police killings of civilians have gone way down. And they are rare events. They are 1/10,000 level events, if measured by arrests. 1/50-60,000 level events if measured by police encounters. And the number of unarmed people who are killed is smaller still. Around 50 last year, again, more were white than black. And not all unarmed victims are innocent. Some get killed in the act of attacking the cops.¬† [<a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/05/19/breaking-officer-involved-shooting-in-buckingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/officer-involved-shooting-in-adair-county-oklahoma/527-e8cdc435-dcd0-429c-962f-b2c82c22068e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article36802032.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>]</p>
<p>Again, the data don‚Äôt tell a clean story, or the whole story. I see no reason to doubt that blacks get more attention from the cops‚Äîthough, honestly, given the distribution of crime in our society, I don‚Äôt know what the alternative to that would be. And once the cops get involved, blacks are more likely to get roughed up, which is bad. But, again, it simply isn‚Äôt clear that racism is the cause. And contrary to everyone‚Äôs expectations, whites seem more likely to get killed by cops. Actually, one factor seems to be that whites are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 times more likely</a> to commit ‚Äúsuicide by cop‚Äù (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 times more likely</a> to commit suicide generally). What‚Äôs going on there? Who knows?</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a lot we don‚Äôt understand about these data. But ask yourself, would our society seem less racist if the disparity ran the other way? Is less physical contact, but a greater likelihood of getting shot and killed a form of white privilege? Is a higher level of suicide by cop, and suicide generally, a form of white privilege? We have a problem here that, read either way, you can tell a starkly racist narrative.</p>
<p>We need ethical, professional policing, of course. But the places with the highest crime in our society need the most of it. Is there any doubt about that? In a city like Milwaukee, blacks are 12 times more likely to get murdered than whites [Not sure where I came by this number, probably a lecture or podcast. It appears the rate is closer to <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/01/12/gun-homicides-milwaukee-has-two-thirds-of-states-gun-killings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 times more likely</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/07/13/residential-segregation-associated-with-black-white-disparity-in-firearm-homicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 times more likely</a> in Wisconsin as a whole‚ÄîSH], again, they are being killed by other African Americans, nearly 100 percent of the time. I think the lowest figure I‚Äôve seen is 93 percent of the time. [As noted above, more recent data suggest that it‚Äôs closer to 90 percent]. What should the police do about this? And what are they likely to do now that our entire country has been convulsed over one horrific case of police misconduct?</p>
<p>We need to lower the temperature on this conversation, and many other conversations, and understand what is actually happening in our society.</p>
<p>But instead of doing this, we now have a whole generation of social activists who seem eager to play a game of chicken with the forces of chaos. Everything I said about the problem of inequality and the need for reform stands. But I think that what we are witnessing in our streets, and on social media, and even in the mainstream press, is a version of mass hysteria. And the next horrific video of a black person being killed by cops won‚Äôt be evidence to the contrary. And there will be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a>. There are 10 million arrests every year. There will always be another video.</p>
<p>And the media has turned these videos into a form of political pornography. And this has deranged us. We‚Äôre now unable to speak or even think about facts. The media has been poisoned by bad incentives, in this regard, and social media doubly so.</p>
<p>In the mainstream of this protest movement, it‚Äôs very common to hear that the only problem with what is happening in our streets, apart from what the cops are doing, is that some criminal behavior at the margins‚Äîa little bit of looting, a little bit of violence‚Äîhas distracted us from an otherwise necessary and inspiring response to an epidemic of racism. Most people in the media have taken exactly this line. People like Anderson Cooper on CNN or the editorial page of the New York Times or public figures like President Obama or Vice President Biden. The most prominent liberal voices believe that the protests themselves make perfect moral and political sense, and that movements like Black Lives Matter are guaranteed to be on the right side of history. How could anyone who is concerned about inequality and injustice in our society see things any other way? How could anyone who isn‚Äôt himself racist not support Black Lives Matter?</p>
<p>But, of course, there‚Äôs a difference between slogans and reality. There‚Äôs a difference between the branding of a movement and its actual aims. And this can be genuinely confusing. That‚Äôs why propaganda works. For instance, many people assume there‚Äôs nothing wrong with ANTIFA, because this group of total maniacs has branded itself as ‚Äúanti-fascist.‚Äù What could be wrong with being anti-fascist? Are you pro fascism?</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a similar problem with Black Lives Matter‚Äîthough, happily, unlike ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter actually seems committed to peaceful protest, which is hugely important. So the problem I‚Äôm discussing is more ideological, and it‚Äôs much bigger than Black Lives Matter‚Äîthough BLM is its most visible symbol of this movement. The wider issue is that we are in the midst of a public hysteria and moral panic. And it has been made possible by a near total unwillingness, particularly on the Left, among people who value their careers and their livelihoods and their reputations, and fear being hounded into oblivion online‚Äîthis is nearly everyone left-of-center politically. People are simply refusing to speak honestly about the problem of race and racism in America.</p>
<p>We are making ourselves sick. We are damaging our society. And by protesting the wrong thing, even the slightly wrong thing, and unleashing an explosion of cynical criminality in the process‚Äîlooting that doesn‚Äôt even have the pretense of protest‚Äîthe Left is empowering Trump, whatever the polls currently show. And if we are worried about Trump‚Äôs authoritarian ambitions, as I think we really should be, this is important to understand. He recently had what looked like paramilitary troops guarding the White House. I don‚Äôt know if we found out who those guys actually were, but that was genuinely alarming. But how are Democrats calls to ‚Äúabolish the police‚Äù going to play to half the country that just watched so many cities get looted? We have to vote Trump out of office and restore the integrity of our institutions. And we have to make the political case for major reforms to deal with the problem of inequality‚Äîa problem which affects the black community most of all.</p>
<p>We need police reform; we need criminal justice reform; we need tax reform; we need health care reform; we need environmental reform‚Äîwe need all of these things and more. And to be just, these policies will need to reduce the inequality in our society. If we did this, African Americans would benefit, perhaps more than any other group. But it‚Äôs not at all clear that progress along these dimensions primarily entails us finding and eradicating more racism in our society.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, what would real progress on the problem of racism look like? What would utter progress look like?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what I think it would look like: More and more people (and ultimately all people) would care less and less (and ultimately not at all) about race. As I‚Äôve said before in various places, skin color would become like hair color in its political and moral significance‚Äîwhich is to say that it would have none.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you don‚Äôt agree with that aspiration. Maybe you think that tribalism based on skin color can‚Äôt be outgrown or shouldn‚Äôt be outgrown. Well, if you think that, I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt know what to say to you. It‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs nothing to say, it‚Äôs just there is so much we disagree about, morally and politically, that I don‚Äôt know where to begin. So that debate, if it can even be had, will have to be left for another time.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this conversation, I have to assume that you agree with me about the goal here, which is to say that you share the hope that there will come a time where the color of a person‚Äôs skin really doesn‚Äôt matter. What would that be like?</p>
<p>Well, how many blondes got into Harvard this year? Does anyone know? What percentage of the police in San Diego are brunette? Do we have enough red heads in senior management in our Fortune 500 companies? No one is asking these questions, and there is a reason for that. No one cares. And we are right not to care.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which people cared about hair color to the degree that we currently care‚Äîor seem to care, or imagine that others care, or allege that they secretly care‚Äîabout skin color. Imagine a world in which discrimination by hair color was a thing, and it took centuries to overcome, and it remains a persistent source of private pain and public grievance throughout society, even where it no longer exists. What an insane misuse of human energy that would be. What an absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p>The analogy isn‚Äôt perfect, for a variety of reasons, but it‚Äôs good enough for us to understand what life would be like if the spell of racism and anti-racism were truly broken. The future we want is not one in which we have all become passionate anti-racists. It‚Äôs not a future in which we are forever on our guard against the slightest insult‚Äîthe bad joke, the awkward compliment, the tweet that didn‚Äôt age well. We want to get to a world in which skin color and other superficial characteristics of a person become morally and politically irrelevant. And if you don‚Äôt agree with that, what did you think Martin Luther King Jr was talking about?</p>
<p>And, finally, if you‚Äôre on the Left and don‚Äôt agree with this vision of a post-racial future, please observe that the people who agree with you, the people who believe that there is no overcoming race, and that racial identity is indissoluble, and that skin color really matters and will always matter‚Äîthese people are white supremacists and neo-Nazis and other total assholes. And these are also people I can‚Äôt figure out how to talk to, much less persuade.</p>
<p>So the question for the rest of us‚Äîthose of us who want to build a world populated by human beings, merely‚Äîthe question is, how do we get there? How does racial difference become uninteresting? Can it become uninteresting by more and more people taking a greater interest in it? Can it become uninteresting by becoming a permanent political identity? Can it become uninteresting by our having thousands of institutions whose funding (and, therefore, very survival) depends on it remaining interesting until the end of the world?</p>
<p>Can it become less significant by being granted more and more significance? By becoming a fetish, a sacred object, ringed on all sides by taboos? Can race become less significant if you can lose your reputation and even your livelihood, at any moment, by saying one wrong word about it?</p>
<p>I think these questions answer themselves. To outgrow our obsession with racial difference, we have outgrow our obsession with race. And you don‚Äôt do that by maintaining your obsession with it.</p>
<p>Now, you might agree with me about the goal and about how a post-racial society would seem, but you might disagree about the path to get there‚Äîthe question of what to do next. In fact, one podcast listener wrote to me recently to say that while he accepted my notion of a post-racial future, he thinks it‚Äôs just far too soon to talk about putting racial politics behind us. He asked me to imagine just how absurd it would have been to tell Martin Luther King Jr, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, that the path beyond racism requires that he become less and less obsessed with race.</p>
<p>That seems like a fair point, but Coleman Hughes has drawn my attention to a string of MLK quotes that seem to be just as transcendent of racial identity politics as I‚Äôm hoping to be here. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1087593991976243200?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see these quotations</a> on his Twitter feed. None of those statements by King would make sense coming out of Black Lives Matter at the moment.</p>
<p>In any case, as I said, I think we are living in a very different time than Martin Luther King was. And what I see all around me is evidence of the fact that we were paying an intolerable price for confusion about racism, and social justice generally‚Äîand the importance of identity, generally‚Äîand this is happening in an environment where the path to success and power for historically disadvantaged groups isn‚Äôt generally barred by white racists who won‚Äôt vote for them, or hire them, or celebrate their achievements, or buy their products, and it isn‚Äôt generally barred by laws and policies and norms that are unfair. There is surely still some of that. But there must be less of it now than there ever was.</p>
<p>The real burden on the black community is the continued legacy of inequality‚Äîwith respect to wealth, and education, and health, and social order‚Äîlevels of crime, in particular, and resulting levels of incarceration, and single-parent families‚Äîand it seems very unlikely that these disparities, whatever their origin in the past, can be solved by focusing on problem of lingering racism, especially where it doesn‚Äôt exist. And the current problem of police violence seems a perfect case in point.</p>
<p>And yet now we‚Äôre inundated with messages from every well-intentioned company and organization singing from the same book of hymns. Black Lives Matter is everywhere. Of course, black lives matter. But the messaging of this movement about the reality of police violence is wrong, and it‚Äôs creating a public hysteria.</p>
<p>I just got a message from the American Association for the Advancement of Science talking about fear of the other. The quote from the email: ‚ÄúLeft unchecked, racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of the other can enter any organization or community¬†‚Äì and destroy the foundations upon which we must build our future.‚Äù Ok, fine. But is that really the concern in the scientific community right now, ‚Äúunchecked racism, sexism, and homophobia.‚Äù Is that really what ails science in the year 2020? I don‚Äôt think so.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll tell you the fear of the other that does seem warranted, everywhere, right now. It‚Äôs the other who has rendered him or herself incapable of dialogue. It‚Äôs the other who will not listen to reason, who has no interest in facts, who can‚Äôt join a conversation that converges on the truth, because he knows in advance what the truth must be. We should fear the other who thinks that dogmatism and cognitive bias aren‚Äôt something to be corrected for, because they‚Äôre the very foundations of his epistemology.¬† We should fear the other who can‚Äôt distinguish activism from journalism or politics from science. Or worse, can make these distinctions, but refuses to. And we‚Äôre all capable of becoming this person. If only for minutes or hours at a time. And this is a bug in our operating system, not a feature. We have to continually correct for it.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking things that many of us learned when the Covid-19 pandemic was first landing on our shores, and we were weighing the pros and cons of closing the schools, was that for tens of millions of American kids, going to school represents the only guarantee of a decent meal on any given day. I‚Äôm pretty confident that most of the kids we‚Äôre talking about here aren‚Äôt white. And whatever you think about the opportunities in this country and whatever individual success stories you can call to mind, there is no question that some of us start on third base, or second base. Everyone has a lot to deal with, of course. Life is hard. But not everyone is a single mom, or single grandparent, struggling to raise kids in the inner city, all the while trying to keep them from getting murdered. The disparities in our society are absolutely heartbreaking and unacceptable. And we need to have a rational discussion about their actual causes and solutions.</p>
<p>We have to pull back from the brink here. And all we have with which to do that is conversation. And the only thing that makes conversation possible is an openness to evidence and arguments‚Äîa willingness to update one‚Äôs view of the world when better reasons are given. And that is an ongoing process, not a place we ever finally arrive.</p>
<p>Ok‚Ä¶ Well, perhaps that was more of an exhortation than I intended, but it certainly felt like I needed to say it. I hope it was useful. And the conversations will continue on this podcast.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>

    <title>A few thoughts on the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://samharris.org/thoughts-implosion-pangburn-philosophy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, the Day of Reflection conference, scheduled for November 17 in NYC, has been cancelled, and some hundreds of ticket holders are now left seeking refunds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was forced to pull out of this event &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/1043277230632132608"&gt;nearly two months ago&lt;/a&gt;¬†and have said very little about it since. Now that Travis Pangburn has officially announced that he will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PangburnInspire/status/1062431248205864962"&gt;‚Äúfolding‚Äù his touring company&lt;/a&gt;, Pangburn Philosophy, I can give a brief account of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I participated in 10 events organized by Pangburn Philosophy between September 2017 and July 2018. I didn‚Äôt always approve of the way those events were staged or marketed, but all of them appeared to be successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, after the cancellation of an August 2018 conference in Auckland, Pangburn seemed intent on running his business off a cliff. He owed a lot of money to several speakers at that point, in the form of unpaid fees and reimbursements. Most egregiously, he seemed less than fully committed to refunding ticket holders for the cancelled Auckland conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, I had two more dates on the calendar with Pangburn in 2018: a dialogue with Brian Greene in Toronto (September 5) and the Day of Reflection conference in New York (November 17). I kept my appointment in Toronto because I was contractually obligated to do so. I also didn‚Äôt want to do anything that would harm Pangburn‚Äôs ability to pay his mounting debts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Toronto, however, it became clear that Pangburn could not be trusted to put his house in order. Facing a total lack of transparency, and realizing that Pangburn was using my ongoing association with him to book future speakers, I withdrew from the NYC conference on September 21 (as well as from a Vancouver conference scheduled for March 2019). Legally, I was able to do this because Pangburn was in breach of my speaking contract. Ethically, I had a far more compelling reason to back out: I couldn‚Äôt promote or participate in an event for which I believed other speakers were unlikely to get paid; nor could I continue to work with someone who still hadn‚Äôt given refunds to ticket holders for a conference that had been canceled more than a month before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I withdrew from the NYC conference, my management team asked Pangburn to give us the email addresses of all ticket holders so that we could notify them that I was no longer involved with the event. Pangburn refused to provide this information. However, he assured us that he would notify everyone himself. (I do not know whether he ever did.) He then stopped responding to our emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the time I pulled out of the NYC conference, I assumed that the revenue from ticket sales was still safely in the box office and that Pangburn would be obliged to issue refunds should the conference fail. That‚Äôs how things normally work, especially at a reputable venue like Lincoln Center. It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me that New York ticketholders might suffer the same fate as those in Auckland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was left with a legal and ethical puzzle that I could not solve. Again, I had no way to communicate with ticket holders directly, and discussing the chaos surrounding Pangburn on my podcast never seemed like an option. Several friends and colleagues still had events on the calendar with him, and I didn‚Äôt want to do anything to derail them. In addition, many speakers who were aware of my reasons for pulling out of the NYC conference were still signed on and seemed intent on making it work. I couldn‚Äôt see anything to do that wouldn‚Äôt risk creating further harms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Pangburn still owes several speakers (including me) an extraordinary amount of money, we were willing to participate in the NYC conference for free as recently as a few days ago, if he would have handed it over to us and stepped away. I have been told that this offer was made, and he declined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it appalling that so many people were needlessly harmed by the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy. I can assure you that every speaker associated with the NYC event will be much wiser when working with promoters in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually¬†&lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday‚Äôs post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website¬†<em>is¬†</em>called¬†<em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing‚Äôs perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn‚Äôt this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don‚Äôt think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he‚Äôs probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn‚Äôt even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we‚Äôve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won‚Äôt provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here.¬†<strong>Zero-hour¬†</strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered.¬†<strong>Zero-time¬†</strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people‚Äìartists in residence, politicians, captains of industry‚Äìalso get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be¬†<em>teaching¬†</em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday‚Äôs post were duties professors undertake¬†<em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don‚Äôt get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other ‚Äúintellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units‚Äù? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù is still a word with a meaning. Most people‚ÄìI dare say the vast majority of people‚Äìthink that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don‚Äôt¬†<em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don‚Äôt have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don‚Äôt appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That‚Äôs exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct ‚Äúprofessors‚Äù recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students‚Äìthey‚Äôd be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts‚Äô soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can‚Äôt afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it‚Äôs business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees‚ÄìI stopped counting‚Äìearn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a>¬†on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one‚Äôs area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn‚Äôt capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>¬∑ Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>¬∑ Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn‚Äôt yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don‚Äôt speak adminstratese, ‚Äúzero-time‚Äù means ‚Äúunpaid.‚Äù Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging¬†<em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs exactly the problem: things are already¬†<em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn‚Äôt even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but¬†<em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as ‚Äúservice to the discipline‚Äù and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this ‚Äúextra‚Äù work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs‚Äô ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don‚Äôt earn anything close to a living wage,¬†<em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it‚Äôs just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class¬†and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook‚Äôs glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24¬†hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try¬†<a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>
