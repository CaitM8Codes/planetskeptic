<p class="lead">I guess corrupt old cronies of the Trump administration can’t simply fade away, they have to constantly pop up in the news, over and over again. But at least I learned something new to me: <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/11/15/steve-bannons-criminal-indictment-is-the-best-thing-thats-ever-happened-to-him/">Steve Bannon is one of those creepy fanatical Catholics</a>? Yikes. I thought he was just a garden-variety fascist, but apparently he has a <em>philosophical ethos</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bannon’s philosophy has been written about quite a bit, including by yours truly [Heather Digby Parton], because it is extremely radical and very, very weird. It’s all wacky mysticism mixed with antediluvian, pre-enlightenment, authoritarianism posing as nationalism based upon the writings of an obscure French writer named René Guénon from the early 20th century and the teachings of one of his followers (and Mussolini adviser) Julius Evola. The school of thought is called “Traditionalism” and it is like no tradition you’ve ever heard of. But Bannon is not alone with this philosophy. It’s held by members of far-right leaders’ inner circles throughout Europe and in places like Brazil and Russia. If there is an intellectual rationale for Trumpism beyond the Dear Leader cult of personality, this “traditionalism” is it.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, I do not want to know more. But Digby gives a couple of sources, and like a doomed character in a horror movie, I can’t resist the urge to go down into the dark basement alone. So <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/the-strange-origins-of-steve-bannons-nationalist-fantasia">here’s one</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>From an early age, Bannon was influenced by his family’s distinctly traditionalist Catholicism and he tended to view current events against the broad sweep of history. In 1984, after Pope John Paul II permitted limited use of the Latin-only Tridentine Mass, which was banned by the Second Vatican Council, Bannon’s parents became Tridentine Catholics, and he eventually followed. Though hardly a moralizing social conservative, he objected bitterly to the secular liberalism encroaching upon the culture. “We shouldn’t be running a victory lap every time some sort of traditional value gets undercut,” he once told me. When he was a naval officer in the late 1970s, Bannon, a voracious autodidact, embarked upon what he described as “a systematic study of the world’s religions” that he carried on for more than a decade. Taking up the Roman Catholic history first instilled in him at his Catholic military high school, he moved on to Christian mysticism and from there to Eastern metaphysics. (In the Navy, he briefly practiced Zen Buddhism before wending his way back to Catholicism.)</p>
<p>Bannon’s reading eventually led him to the work of René Guénon, an early-20th-​­century French occultist and metaphysician who was raised a Roman Catholic, practiced Freemasonry, and later became a Sufi Muslim who observed the Sharia. There are many forms of traditionalism in religion and philosophy. Guénon developed a philosophy often called “Traditionalism” (capital “T”), a form of anti-modernism with precise connotations. Guénon was a “primordial” Traditionalist, who believed that certain ancient religions, including the Hindu Vedanta, Sufism, and medieval Catholicism, were repositories of common spiritual truths, revealed to mankind in the earliest age of the world, that were being wiped out by the rise of secular modernity in the West. What Guénon hoped for, he wrote in 1924, was to “restore to the West an appropriate traditional civilization.”</p></blockquote>
<p>No. Enough. Stop. Wait…what’s that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/04/16/why-far-right-nationalists-like-steve-bannon-have-embraced-russian-ideologue/">creepy figure crawling out of the television set</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>Bannon acknowledges affinities with the philosophies of Julius Evola and Dugin in relation to his conservative vision for world politics. Like them, Bannon believes in an Eurasian Christian empire led by “the church militant” that will reform religious, economic, political and social foundations around the world. Such views underlie his speech about conservative Christianity as a bulwark against liberalism at the Vatican in 2014, and it’s no coincidence that Bannon has been integral to the establishment of the conservative Catholic Dignitatis Humanae Institute in an 800-year-old monastery.</p>
<p>All of this should give pause. These appropriations of the Middle Ages by figures like Dugin and Bannon pose an odd reversal of the problem of calling things we don’t like “medieval.” Yet these appropriations are equally misleading and even more dangerous. The resulting racist, xenophobic, misogynist, “traditionalist” construction of the Middle Ages is pervasive in conservative spheres. This ideology is now not only Dugin’s construction but also the view that informs many right-wing thinkers like Putin, Bannon and Trump.</p></blockquote>
<p>No more, please. I’m going to have nightmares about <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/07/19/trumps-rasputin-steve-bannon-doesnt-have-russia-ties-but-encapsulates-infamous-advisors-spiritualism/">Catholic fanatics under the bed</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a little bit difficult to sort out exactly what Bannon does believe since he’s definitely a populist and nationalist. Mostly, it seems, he’s a sort of spiritualist, like the Russian Rasputin. According to Green, Bannon’s most important influences are René Guénon, a French writer whose 1929 book “The Crisis of the Modern World” stated that everything started to go to hell in 1312 when the Knights Templar were destroyed; and Julius Evola, an Italian writer whose 1934 book, “Revolt Against the Modern World,” influenced Mussolini. Interestingly, that book was also a seminal work for the Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, Vladimir Putin’s most influential ideologue, and the man who once called Steve Bannon his ideological soulmate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/russias-alt-right-rasputin-says-hes-steve-bannons-ideological-soul-mate">Alexandra Nemtsova at the Daily Beast reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Alexander Verkhovsky, director of Russian SOVA, a Moscow-based NGO monitoring ultra-nationalist groups, “Dugin is talking about creating some new cross-cultural nation of anti-Atlantic, traditional ideology—his theory often sounds like a pretty fascist approach. He said and wrote a lot, calling for a war in Ukraine; many Russian nationalists who listened or read Dugin’s texts actually joined the insurgencies in Ukraine afterward.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think Bannon looks quite strong and healthy enough to <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/rasputin-death">put up as much of a fight as Rasputin</a>, but you never know. He could be like Jason, or Michael Myers, impossible to kill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This devil who was dying of poison, who had a bullet in his heart, must have been raised from the dead by the powers of evil,” Yusupov wrote. “There was something appalling and monstrous in his diabolical refusal to die.”</p>
</blockquote>

    <title>Ta-Nehisi Coates always provides a good start to the day</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">Even if it is a little depressing. Here he <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/ta-nehisi-coates-tony-judt-ill-fares-the-land/620628/">comments on a book by Tony Judt</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I had never read so merciless a book. Tony had no use for pieties—no tolerance for invocations of a “Good War” or the “Greatest Generation.” Power reigns in Postwar, often in brutal ways. Tony writes of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust returning to Poland only to be asked, “Why have you come back?” He introduced me to intellectuals, such as François Furet, forced to reckon not just with Stalin’s crimes but with a discrediting of a “Grand Narrative” of history itself. “All the lives lost, and resources wasted in transforming societies under state direction,” Tony writes of this reckoning, were “just what their critics had always said they were: loss, waste, failure and crime.” Early in Postwar, Tony quotes the observations of a journalist covering the ethnic cleansings that characterized postwar Europe. The journalist self-satisfyingly claims that history will “exact a terrible retribution.” But, Tony tells us, history “exacted no such retribution.” No righteous, God-ordained price was to be paid for this crime against humanity. The arc of history did not magically bend. It was bent, even broken, by those with power.</p></blockquote>
<p>That resonates with me, too. There is no trajectory of history in evolution, either, just a story we tell ourselves after the fact. There’s nothing but chance and a directionless, generation-by-generation stumbling, with no goal but survival, and afterwards the survivors pat themselves on the back and pretend it was destiny that they made it.</p>
<p>It’s also why I have no sympathy for Pinkerisms. It’s all retrospective coronations all the way down, self-defeating reassurances from the so-far successful that the status quo will carry us forward into a glorious future. It never works that way. Every advancement is the product of a battle by those who say “Not good enough!” and who strive to do better.</p>
<p>And sometimes the better don’t make it anyway.</p>

<p class="lead">Curious. I got up at a ridiculous hour again this morning, and cautiously walked into the kitchen. Why cautiously? Because our cat likes to leave us little presents, like a puddle of puke or a dead mouse. I flicked on the light and saw…onions. Onions on the floor, onions on the countertop, onions on the stove, onions in pots. The source was obvious — we had a mesh bag of onions hanging from a hook — and the material cause was clear — the mesh was slit wide open, from the knot at the top to the bottom of the bag. It was no longer a bag, but more of a useless mesh sheet. But how? Who, or what, committed the act of bagicide that liberated all these onions?</p>
<p>My first suspect is the evil cat, except that she has heretofore exhibited an irrational fear of the stove and the kitchen counters. The criminal mind is a superstitious mind, and she is definitely the kind of super-villain you’d find in a Batman comic book. But the bag was neatly slit, not raggedly torn, as a beast would do.</p>
<p>Also near the bag was a butcher block of knives that I’d sharpened to a razor edge yesterday. They must have played a role, somehow.</p>
<p>My keen deductive mind is forced to conclude that the cat, while practicing to overcome her fear of kitchen appliances, has learned to wield a knife and slash viciously at objects in her environment. That may seem unlikely, but when you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth<sup>*</sup>. I’m going to have to keep a closer eye on her now. First the onions, then the master, you know.</p>
<hr/>
<p><sup>*</sup>By the way, I detest that dictum — it’s typical Holmesian illogical BS. You can never eliminate all the impossibilities, you can never even know all the alternatives. What if it’s something I didn’t even think of?</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A murmuration of starlings over Studland, Dorset (Creative Commons License / Flickr)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/31636555564_d26cedda66_b.jpg" height="695" alt="31636555564_d26cedda66_b" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What links the brain, the climate and a murmuration of starlings? They're all made up of many components, interacting with a touch of randomness and a dash of disorder: the recipe for a complex system. The last two ingredients &amp;ndash; randomness and disorder &amp;ndash; make their behaviour extremely difficult to model and predict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But physicists do enjoy a challenge, and in the 1960s Syukuro Manabe sought to model one such system: energy transfer and transport within the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate. Manabe&amp;rsquo;s work was the first to explore the interplay between the greenhouse gas effect, the rising of hot air due to convection and the heat released when clouds form. It demonstrated that increasing carbon dioxide leads to rising temperatures closer to the ground, with the upper atmosphere becoming colder. Most strikingly, he showed that doubling the carbon dioxide concentration in the air caused an increase in Earth surface temperature of 2℃. This work seeded the climate change models we have today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A decade later, Klaus Hasselmann took Manabe&amp;rsquo;s work a step further by incorporating the chaos of weather into climate modelling in order to make predictions over time. To represent the rapidly changing weather conditions in the atmosphere, he mathematically built in chance to the model. This paved the way to proving anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are behind today&amp;rsquo;s global warming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For these breakthroughs, Manabe and Hasselmann have been awarded one half of this year&amp;rsquo;s Nobel Prize in Physics. The other half has gone to Giorgio Parisi, whose dedication to understanding disordered and complex materials led to revelations of hidden patterns in the mathematics that could be used to harness predictability in a wide range of complex disordered scenarios, from neuroscience to machine learning, and in the mesmerising sight of a flock of starlings forming a living abstract artwork across the sky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Predicting the unpredictable sounds like a Nobel Prize-worthy achievement. And now it officially is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Predators in the Church</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5881/predators-in-the-church#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/cross_catholic_religion_christianity-614946-_1_.jpg" height="900" alt="cross_catholic_religion_christianity-614946-_1_" width="1200" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Widespread anger met the revelations in October that clergy and lay members of the French Catholic Church had sexually abused some 330,000 children over a 70-year period. The head of the committee charged with investigating the historic allegations, Jean-Marc Sauv&amp;eacute;, said that up until the early 2000s, the Catholic Church had &amp;ldquo;showed a profound and even cruel indifference towards the victims&amp;rdquo;. Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Devaux, the head of the victims&amp;rsquo; group La Parole Lib&amp;eacute;r&amp;eacute;e, branded the abusers &amp;ldquo;a disgrace to our humanity&amp;hellip; In this hell there have been abominable mass crimes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The committee&amp;rsquo;s report told of how the crimes were systematically covered up by the Church. Around 100,000 of the children were abused by laypeople, such as teachers; the rest &amp;ndash; some 230,000 children &amp;ndash; were victims of the predations of priests and other clergymen. The report put the estimate for the number of abusers at between 2,900 and 3,200.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It marks the first public reckoning in France of a phenomenon that has hounded the Catholic Church worldwide. Stories of child abuse by clergymen began to capture public attenton in the US and Canada in the 1980s, before action over allegations was taken in Argentina and Austria in the 1990s. In 2013, the Australian government set up a commission to investigate abuses carried out in its churches, the majority of which were covered up. Germany and Ireland have also been forced to account for clerical abuse of children, much of which was also kept secret for years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the decades of cover-up in France having now been exposed, the Church finds itself in a precarious situation. Sauv&amp;eacute; has called on it to compensate victims in cases where too much time has passed for prosecutions to take place. In others, court trials for those identified who have yet to be punished are likely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How these revelations are interpreted is vital to determining what kind of response is appropriate. The figure of 330,000 victims shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be read as the sum total of individual crimes; rather, in the words of one campaigner, it is a &amp;ldquo;collective horror&amp;rdquo;. The number of perpetrators, coupled with the extent of the cover-ups, is evidence enough that it would have required the consent of numerous gatekeepers within the Church. Over decades, a culture that permits paedophilia has been quietly nurtured. If people at the top were concerned, they made very little effort to investigate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if its responses to past scandals are anything to go by, the Vatican would have you think otherwise. In cases where it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to silence whistleblowers altogether, it has historically sought to downplay the significance of such allegations, if not deflect them entirely. In 2013, the Vatican angered campaigners after it refused to hand over details on clerical sex abuses to a UN panel investigating the matter, claiming that the move was part of its confidentiality policy. A special summit to discuss child abuse, convened by the Church in 2019, was spun by the Vatican&amp;rsquo;s press office as a marker of the work done to tackle the issue, rather than a critical response to an endemic and deeply harmful problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the French report will finally mark a turning point, a recognition &amp;ndash; surely now unavoidable &amp;ndash; of a deep rot within the Church. That should have happened years ago. After all, what other institution has been so dogged by paedophilia scandals that it has been forced to convene a special summit on the matter? Compensation and court trials may go some way towards redressing its past crimes. But its victims, especially those who still hold close to Catholicism, and who may want their own children to enter the faith, will demand more than this: they will know that the pleas for forgiveness issued by the Church since the report was published are unsatisfactory. A deeper inquiry into what exactly it is within the Church that has allowed such large-scale abuse to take place, and a concerted effort to overhaul its permissive culture, is long overdue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="The Lions Panel at the Pont d'Arc cave, part of the Chauvet Cave system in southern France (Wikimedia Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/18_PanneauDesLions_PartieDroite_BisonsPoursuivisParDesLions.jpg" height="533" alt="18_PanneauDesLions_PartieDroite_BisonsPoursuivisParDesLions" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John-Paul Stonard is an art historian, author and curator. His book, "Creation. Art Since the Beginning", about the story of art from the palaeolithic to the contemporary era, was published by Bloomsbury in October 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first works of art began to appear around 50,000 years ago in different locations around the world - and, curiously, at about the same time. These early artists were not contacting one another across the seas. What explains this seeming coincidence? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I begin &lt;em&gt;Creation: Art Since the Beginning&lt;/em&gt; with the remarkable recent discovery that the earliest human images of which we know appeared at roughly the same time at opposite sides of the planet &amp;ndash; in western Europe and Indonesia. They are chance survivals. We will never know what has not survived from that long early period of human creativity. And yet the coincidence of images appearing east and west does suggest that there was some time trigger in human evolution such that, at a certain point on our long journey out of Africa, it became possible and useful to make large, detailed images of animals. Prehistory is the most dynamic area in the study of human image-making, and curiously the youngest, since atomic dating techniques are only around 60 years old. I suspect that the story will become ever more complex and fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing missing from the first 20,000 years of human image-making is images of humans, or even mountains, rivers and trees. Only animals were drawn. Why so? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As so little has survived from prehistory, we can say very little with certainty, although it is striking that almost all of the images that have survived show other animals. This fact, I think, takes us to the heart of human image-making: we paint, draw and sculpt things close to us, things we depend on, things we need to understand, things we love &amp;ndash; and also things we are afraid of, and struggle with. Animals were probably all of these things to early humans. One thing we know is that wherever early humans went they wiped out whole species, surely a way of assuring ascendency on the survival ladder. When I look at these early animal images I see a quest for knowledge, a sense of admiration and love, but also a feeling of mourning, a first confrontation with the inevitability and finality of death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What might have struck the first visitors to the Chauvet Cave in France or the Leang Tedongnge Cave in Indonesia is the sophistication of the images. One might expect human artistic evolution to more or less mimic a child&amp;rsquo;s artistic maturation: start simple, and over time, evolve a sense of form and finesse. Did the earliest humans have within them an innate flair, or rather is it the case that the earliest sketches and stick figures are probably lost to us? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The earliest images must have evolved over thousands of years. I suspect that they began not with stick figures, but rather with random marks scratched, or natural marks observed, on rocks. Early humans saw how these lines suggested animals, and added to them, gradually creating forms. The earliest images may well have been carved, rather than drawn &amp;ndash; we had been chipping away to create stone tools for hundreds of thousands of years, so that our skill at carving was probably much greater than drawing. This is the important difference with children's drawings, which have their own sophistication: children have yet to develop technique and skill in other parts of life which they can bring into the making of images. The earliest human images were part of the adult life of hunting and survival. Their sophistication shows their importance for life, as well as suggesting the role of instinct in their creation &amp;ndash; something innate to being human that led to their appearance. Perhaps prehistoric children drew like children nowadays. &lt;em&gt;Creation &lt;/em&gt;ends with a description of a child's drawing (actually one by our five-year-old daughter) &amp;ndash; children's drawings form the most continuous tradition of art making, although that doesn't mean that they form the beginning of art itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You write: &amp;ldquo;Evolving a capacity to think in terms of images was inseparable from the long story of migration and the encounter with nature&amp;hellip;.that had begun long before, in Africa.&amp;rdquo; Can you explain this a bit more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Well, I think images are always evidence of some kind of encounter. The challenges of migration, of making sense of new environments, of providing some kind of grounding in a strange and often hostile world can be seen throughout the history of human image-making. We can talk with more certainty about later moments of human migration &amp;ndash; the spread of Bantu-speaking people and their tradition of masquerade within Africa, for example, or Protestant migration in the late 16th century to the Netherlands and to Britain, or the migration of African Americans from the south to the north, documented by the American artist Jacob Lawrence in his series &amp;ldquo;The Migration of the Negro&amp;rdquo;. The stories are endless, and they can all be read back, it seems to me, to the earliest moment of human life, our long journey over the planet from our homeland in Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long ago, the compulsion to create art wasn&amp;rsquo;t a natural human instinct. Now it most certainly is. Has your research into early humans given you a sense of why this instinct has become so powerful within us today? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I don't use the word &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo; in the early chapters of &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;, and in fact use it very sparingly throughout the book &amp;ndash; no more than 20 times, I think. The compulsion to make images has always been with us. The question nowadays is why those images have become so philosophical, intellectual, imaginary, symbolic &amp;ndash; however you want to put it. They certainly have a kinship with the earliest human images, but the comparison has become a clich&amp;eacute; (cave paintings and Picasso, etc.). More interesting is the simple fact of the discovery, barely a hundred years ago, of the antiquity of human life, and of the deep time into which human images fall. This discovery was part of the creation of the contemporary world in ways that are still difficult to fathom, but it does show us how deep-rooted image-making is, and how it distinguishes us as an animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From cave painting we turned to other forms of art and representation&amp;mdash;standing stones, and then dolmen. What changes in human social evolution spurred this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;When we settle down in houses we get into interior decoration, choosing wallpaper, carpets, ornaments. Perhaps we lose some of the creative habits of our teenage years. We stop drawing and painting so much. We put the guitar or clarinet back in its case. We embark on a new stage of life which seems more about building a solid world around us, rather than indulging in the fleeting life of images and music. Perhaps this is what happened to the earliest settlers, who saw that survival and the creation of wealth came from a fixed agricultural life, rather than the roving life of a hunter. The earliest standing stone structures are remarkable constructions yet bear images that seem crude compared to the drawings made by hunters for tens of thousands of years. This divide between the vivid nomadic imagery, and the more decorative, utilitarian forms of settled life continues throughout human history. The division between the art instinct and the architecture instinct stand at the beginning of the story told in &lt;em&gt;Creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast-forward several millennia, and depictions of the two world wars of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century showed that a willingness to look inwards and interrogate the human body, and the pains inflicted on it, had arrived. Do we see through art the almost lineal development of a capacity for ever deeper self-inquiry? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Images of the body in pain made during the 20th century were by no means new &amp;ndash; you can see such images in Buddhist sculpture, in medieval illumination, in Hellenistic sculpture. But I think the philosophical drive in art since the 20th century has perhaps meant that the conclusions we draw from these works are broader and deeper. I think of Mona Hatoum's video installation, &lt;em&gt;Corps &amp;eacute;tranger, &lt;/em&gt;showing an endoscopic probe of the artist's body &amp;ndash; an astounding self-portrait. The drive to knowledge has always been behind the creation of images, and knowledge, as the Greeks were the first to make clear in their lifelike sculpture, is always rooted in the human body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art historians are rarely asked to look into the future in the way scientists might be. But does your examination of the past 50,000 years of image-making throw up any patterns that could be used to predict how art might evolve over the coming millennia? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Not really. There are no patterns. Gombrich began his famous &lt;em&gt;Story of Art &lt;/em&gt;by rightly saying that there is no such thing as art, but a deeper truth is that there is no story, and so no way of knowing what comes next &amp;ndash; who would want to? In the introduction to &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; I describe a drawing made by the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai (of &amp;ldquo;Great Wave&amp;rdquo; fame), based on a dream he had of a landscape joined together by hundreds of bridges. I use it as a metaphor for the history I tell in my book. The point is to keep moving and keep discovering connections. I can't say what's coming, but I can say what I think will survive, and that is art made with a feeling of belief, and art that interrogates what it means to be human and to encounter the world around us, and the world within. As James Joyce put it in &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, which I quote in &lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;The supreme question about the work of art is out of how deep a life it springs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

    <title>The UK's solution to biodiversity loss is to outsource habitat destruction</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5880/the-uks-solution-to-biodiversity-loss-is-to-outsource-habitat-destruction#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A huge harvester dwarfed by Cottam Power Station in Nottinghamshire (Richard Croft / Creative Commons License)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/209054_7baa0a65.jpg" height="427" alt="209054_7baa0a65" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Natural History Museum &lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2021/october/analysis-warns-global-biodiversity-is-below-safe-limit.html"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a stark warning in October when it revealed that the United Kingdom ranked among the least biodiverse countries in the world, having lost nearly half its native wildlife since the start of the agricultural revolution in the mid-17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Accompanying the release of a study of 58,000 species worldwide, from which the Museum positioned the UK in the worst 10 per cent of countries, Andy Purvis, who led the research, labelled the decline &amp;ldquo;devastating&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Biodiversity loss is just as catastrophic as climate change,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In its Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII), the Museum puts the threshold for resilience at 90 per cent of intact native species. Above this &amp;ldquo;safe limit&amp;rdquo;, an ecosystem is highly likely to survive in a functional state; below it, and the chances of disruption, if not worse, grow. The global average currently stands at 75 per cent; the UK&amp;rsquo;s is recorded at 53 per cent. While its rate of loss has largely steadied in recent years, numerous species remain close to extinction. Onetime staples of the British countryside, such as the cicada and the turtle dove, may soon be no longer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One reason for such a comparatively low score is the early beginnings of intensive agriculture here. The UK is where modernisation of farming practices &amp;ndash; crop rotation, selective breeding, improved soil fertility and more &amp;ndash; was pioneered three centuries ago. It is also where another culprit, the Industrial Revolution, took off. The combined effects of both might have transformed the UK into a global economic powerhouse, but they destroyed much of its wildlife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This of course has serious implications for the future of human health, not just the health of plants and animals. Insects and birds, for instance, are central to pollination, which in turn is key not only to a diverse human plant-based diet, but to the production of crops that the animals we eat depend on. Biodiversity keeps the nutrient cycle ticking over, and its various functions &amp;ndash; pollination included &amp;ndash; keep our air, soil and water clean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet the destroying of habitat to feed UK consumption doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop at our borders. Since the UK crossed its safe threshold some 200 years, it has, Purvis said, effectively been exporting biodiversity damage elsewhere. &amp;ldquo;Basically, we cashed in our natural capital for economic capital hundreds of years ago.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As its spending power rose, and as its home-grown resources shrunk, the UK upped its imports, everything from food to timber to even &lt;a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/09/02/uk-imports-sewage-sludge-agriculture/"&gt;sewage for fertiliser&lt;/a&gt;. By the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, as Susan Pedersen &lt;a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n18/susan-pedersen/flocculent-and-feculent"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in the&lt;em&gt; London Review of Books&lt;/em&gt; in October, four-fifths of the bread being sold in the UK was made from imported wheat; indeed some 40 per cent of globally traded wheat ended up here. And with the very wealthy eating close to 400 grams of meat every day, the UK also began importing astronomical amounts of pork, beef and poultry. &amp;ldquo;No country was so dependent on imported meat,&amp;rdquo; Petersen noted. &amp;ldquo;With only 3 per cent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population, by 1930 Britain was taking 99 per cent of the world&amp;rsquo;s ham and bacon exports, 63 per cent of exported butter and 59 per cent of exported beef.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of these animals were, of course, likely raised via intensive farming practices similar to those that had been used in the UK, and which had laid waste to so much of its countryside. And while the composition of imports has changed somewhat since the 1930s, the quantity of food being shipped to the UK remains high: today, half of everything consumed here &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55408788"&gt;is imported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear that levels of domestic consumption are not only much too great for our own ecosystem, but are destroying faraway habitats too. But if we reduced the intensity of farming here, and thereby allowed our depleted stocks to regenerate - and yet did nothing to lower consumption levels or diversify patterns of consumption - it would just increase the burden on fragile regions elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s not clear is whether the governments around the world, including in the UK, that continue to outsource habitat destruction consider depleted stocks elsewhere their responsibility. Yet the long-term consequences of such exploitative relationships are now being quantified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Under a scenario in which wealthy countries exploit low-income countries, Timor-Leste - currently home to some of the world's most biodiverse marine habitats - could see its [Biodiversity Intactness Index] value fall by almost 25% by 2050,&amp;rdquo; the National History Museum wrote upon release of its study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anything, therefore, the Museum&amp;rsquo;s report should be understood not as an individualisation of crises, but something quite different: an illustration of how everything&amp;mdash;human and insect, country A and country B&amp;mdash;is interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of hype of late over the 21st century "space race", which pits some of the world's richest men - Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos - against one another in a contest to see who will pioneer a new age of space adventure. But as Nick Schmidle, journalist and author of the recent &lt;em&gt;Test Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut&lt;/em&gt; discusses here, this is not just about space. There is machoism at play, and pressing questions over whose interests these men are serving: theirs and their wealthy customers, or humankind's at large?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A conversation about the marriage of extreme wealth and hubris, and what's next in "space tourism" and our exploration of the final frontier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosts: &lt;/strong&gt;Alice Bloch and Samira Shackle&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exec Producer: &lt;/strong&gt;Alice Bloch&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound Engineer: &lt;/strong&gt;David Crackles&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music: &lt;/strong&gt;Danosongs&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Image artwork: &lt;/strong&gt;Ed Dingli&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want access to more fresh thinking, why not subscribe to &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; magazine?

We're all about exploring matters of reason and unreason, criticism and debate, all through conversations with writers and thinkers about their work and ideas. I'm Niki Seth-Smith, and I'm Samira Shackle. Now on here, &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt;, we like to focus on philosophy, culture and science. And we mean &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; in the broadest sense. In this series, we've heard from anatomist Alice Roberts about the significance of human burials through the ages, we've heard from data scientist Pragya Agarwal discussing motherhood and choice, and the brilliant physicist Carlo Rovelli has talked rather poetically about quantum mechanics, truths and the humbling power of science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samira Shackle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that word &amp;ldquo;humble&amp;rdquo; probably isn't the first that comes to mind when you think about last year when Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Virgin&amp;rsquo;s Richard Branson made history within days of each other by travelling beyond the Earth's atmosphere on spacecraft that their own private companies had built. So a lot has been made of the spectacle of these men's egos knocking together. But Niki, your guest today knows the story and the context to it better than most of us do. He's the journalist Nick Schmidle, and for his latest book, he's taking a really close look at contemporary space travel. I'll be listening in to this one. So I'll let you tell us more about Nick and I'll be back with you later for a catch up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niki Seth-Smith:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks Samira. So, next, a journalist who writes for the likes of &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. And his first book was about his tumultuous years spent in Pakistan, so he clearly likes an adventure. In 2014, he started tracking the rise of Virgin Galactic. That's the American spaceflight company founded by Richard Branson and his British Virgin Group. His book, &lt;em&gt;Test Gods&lt;/em&gt;, looks at that story and more, taking us into the work and lives of the people fuelling the new space race. It's a tale of genius, lunacy and optimistic evangelism that's really only just begun. But it's also personal for Nick. His own father was a fighter pilot, having attended Top Gun, that military school made famous in the 1986 Tom Cruise film. I asked what drew him to document the private space race, and why is it such an exciting field today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Schmidle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was drawn to the story and drawn to this sort of unfamiliar industry in some ways by a terrible tragedy, by the Virgin Galactic crash on October 31 2014. I remember getting the news alert. And looking at the framework like the nut graph of this news story and thinking to myself, wait a second, there's a company based in California owned by a British billionaire who lives on a private island that's flying winged rocket ships in the California desert, one of which just crashed and killed a test pilot. I was like, you know, I didn't even know, we were still, I didn't even know that there were test pilots still doing this sort of thing, never mind kind of in that, you know, in this industry and in this world. So that was what piqued my interest. And I went out there shortly after that, to explore what was possible for what became a very long magazine piece for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;. So that was kind of my entry into the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So we'll get back to that crash a little bit later. But you say you weren't aware of what was going on in that private space race. But I think your father was a fighter pilot. And he even helped to train one of the men in your book who goes on to fly spacecraft for Virgin Galactic. So can you just tell me a bit about that connection, like did your father's profession lead you to an interest in in pilots initially.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when I started writing for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, just by sort of dint of accident the first two pieces that I did for the magazine were about the military. One was about a crazy court martial story in which the soldier had been tried three times for the same murder. And there were all these sort of interesting, legal questions about, double jeopardy, triple jeopardy, etc. So that was one piece. And the second piece was, I had sources inside of the Special Operations community and I had done this sort of talk about the Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. And I remember someone asking me if I considered myself a military guy at the magazine and I really resisted the categorization because I didn't, you know, I sort of imagined myself as like the crime guy who got to who stumbled into the bin Laden story, just started, you know, because I had the sources but that wasn't really what I was focused on. And in some ways, the Virgin Galactic story to me, yes, it felt familiar, but I had never been interested in aviation really, I was interested in a certain type of character and I felt like the test pilots who were flying these winged rocket ships in the California desert were those characters. But it wasn't really until I got out there that I both realised my dad's connection, and also, it took me a while. And when I say a while, you know, I worked on the project first as a magazine story for four years and, all told, the book for seven. And at one point, you know, I kind of had to stop and keep asking myself, what was holding my interest? And that in some ways, ultimately gets back to your question, which is that I realised that it was an opportunity for me to write about my dad, in a way that I had never thought was sort of doable. It always felt too direct and I wasn't sure how I could do that. And so suddenly, this, this was an opportunity for me to come at it from a different angle, for me to write about a world that I knew, because I'd grown up around sort of, you know, elite pilots, but that I had never studied per se. And look, truth be told, aviation in and of itself, I find it interesting, but not super, super interesting. I mean, I'm not like an aeroplane junkie. And it was always for me, it was the psychology of elite performers, whether they are navy seals, or whether they are, you know, investigators or whether they're test pilots. Like that's kind of the world that's always intrigued me. And that's, that's what ultimately brought me to this story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it's also a world of risk and masculinity. And I guess, talking about the psychology of these men, and it still is mostly men I think people are focusing or have been focusing, especially last summer, on the man in charge as an Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos - as three of the world's richest men who've all founded these private space travel companies, and are competing in what seems to be a very sort of machismo kind of way to build up their businesses. But before we get back to your book, what do you make of all that? I mean, that SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, competing together and, you know, maybe some reflections on who's most likely to win, if you have any thoughts on that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, sure. Well, yes, all three companies definitely run by sort of alpha men, run by billionaires, run by men who, in the case of Bezos and Musk particularly, kind of have everything that they could want here, like they've achieved, they've had such success as businessmen, here on Earth, that sort of space was both a challenge. And also, I feel like Jeff Bezos, his business empire has infiltrated and penetrated our lives to such an extent that, you know, it's really kind of uncanny. So that is unquestionably a factor, that's unquestionably a truth about who is leading this industry. For me, Richard Branson has never really been a big part of this story for me up until when he flew on July 11th. He doesn't spend a lot of time out in Mojave, California, his presence is kind of more like spiritual advisor than it is a CEO. I mean, he's not technically fluent. In fact, there's this curious legal prohibition on Richard Branson because the US Congress, I think, in the 70s drafted this piece of legislation that makes it illegal for US nationals to share technology or know how with foreign nationals that could be used for quote unquote dual purposes. So you know, rocket technology that could be, say, used to help an enemy government design a cruise missile. And so as a result of that, Richard Branson is actually legally prohibited from knowing the technical details of the rocket company that he founded. So his role is very much arm's length. And so he was always there. But in my eyes like it was an odd like presence and less of the guy on the shop room floor, which is how Elon Musk is and to a lesser extent, Jeff Bezos, from what I understand. There is a great deal of inherent sort of machismo and masculinity in these men trying to get there first in the case, you know, of the suborbital stuff, which is the contest. I mean, there are many different races. You sort of asked who's going to win. I mean, Elon Musk has for all intents and purposes won the space race, this new space race. He has now put well over 100 rockets into orbit. He has huge contracts with NASA. He&amp;rsquo;s the juggernaut here. Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are sort of fighting for the lesser spoils at this point, which is the suborbital space race. And they're just trying, they're trying to form companies that can shuttle tourists to the edge of space. And that's what we saw play out with the, you know, kind of back to back flights. And so yeah, that's it, but it is undoubtedly a male dominated world at this moment. But that's a reflection also of engineering schools. I mean, the engineering schools in the US, I think that in the female enrolment is like 20%, on average. So when you walk into the hangar at Virgin Galactic, you know, the women are, you know, terribly underrepresented. But that's a reflection also of the engineering schools that they're coming out of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I'm very intrigued and amused by this description of Branson as the all is, you know, like the man behind the curtain, because in the book, he does seem this weird spectral presence who sort of, you know, is not there at all and he kind of pops up and sort of seems to steal all the glory and these big extravagant parties. And it puts me in mind of when Bezos and of course, Branson, you know, they both launch themselves into space within weeks of each other. But on that very same day that Bezos took his journey, the Federal Aviation Administration actually said that their going to space is not enough to make you an astronaut. So what is the new definition? And was that a bit of a sort of pointed comment for them to have made at that particular time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I was also quite intrigued by the timing and the nature of the comment right? So both of these companies, particularly Virgin Galactic, just because they've been more of a vocal record over the course of the last 20 years - Bezos and Blue Origin have proceeded much more quietly and deliberately in some ways, and like in some ways, ultimately the question for a prospective customer is &amp;ldquo;Who do you want? What do you want sort of taking your space?&amp;rdquo; Do you want the company owned by the guy who you know brands everything including you know Coca Cola and including cola and condoms and dresses in you know wedding dresses to promote his wedding line? Or do you want to go to space with the guy who guarantees is going to get your package at your doorstep in two days? And so, is you the difference between their two flights was stark. I mean, I thought the Virgin Galactic flight, you know, it was good - Stephen Colbert hosting, you had, you know, musical guests. It was flashy, it was showy. Whereas the Blue Origin flight was, in some ways, downright kind of boring. Like it was so dry, but I think they are offering a more reliable product and there are a lot of technical explanations for them for that. But it's not a project that I would want to have spent seven years writing about, you know. There it's automated. Like I said, it's a relatively sort of staid affair. Going back to your question though, but this is this is very much Branson style is to kind of swoop in for the big parties. And that tension, that disconnect, between the operational realities on the ground and in the hangar in Mojave, California, and now also in Spaceport America in New Mexico, of the actual engineers and technicians and pilots who are who are operating these vehicles. And the disconnect between that reality and the marketing sort of razzmatazz, sort of smoke and mirrors side of the company that is trying to sell tickets is stark, and it is in some ways, I think, the company's own greatest threat, which is this central identity. It wants to be a luxury brand catering to the rich and famous, but it is still very much an experimental flight test programme. And they want to make the programme sound like it is an obvious next step for those who have everything here on Earth. But it's still an extraordinarily, you know, risky and dangerous and ultimately untested vehicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You've maybe pointed to its experimental nature, and there seems to be a bit of tension between just being a tourism business for extremely wealthy individuals. But also, you know, being perhaps on the cutting edge of science, or at least, doing these research flights and Virgin Galactic makes these claims that they're opening up space to two scientists or more scientists, then you know, we'll be able to reach space. So can you tell me a little bit about that side of the operation. Are those sort of claims valid, that they're really interested in research?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, how interested they are, how much that is a corporate priority is unclear. So I meant to sort of break that out in a few things. I think that technological advancements inevitably will come from companies that are exploring and experimenting with new technologies, right? So we don't know what might emerge or grow out of Virgin Galactic suborbital tourism company. And its usage of a hybrid rocket motor. Generally and traditionally you have liquid rocket engines and solid rocket motors. So that's either solid fuel or liquid fuel, and Virgin Galactic uses a hybrid of the two. Historically there are very few programmes that have used a hybrid rocket motor so you know, their ability to sort of harness this technology potentially opens up new opportunities that we just don't know what they are, but as I can tell, they're doing this to sell tickets. They're doing this to sell tickets to people who can afford originally $250,000 reservation and now, as of a few weeks ago, for those looking to sign up in the coming years. A $450,000 reservation, that's what they're here for. That's why Branson made the company, is not because he's interested in science for science&amp;rsquo;s sake, and not because as they also claim he's interested in quote unquote democratising space. Like, yes, if more people become astronauts as a result of their programme then they are sort of, you know, I guess they're democratising in that sense. But this gets back to your question about the FAA, which I didn't answer, then that is that Virgin Galactic has made that a marketing point for the past two, almost two decades now, that you will be an astronaut if you fly with us. And the way that they've in some ways kept customers interest over the course of the past 17 years is with inducements to, you know, to go on trips and give them you know, little business cards that say, future astronaut and things like that. And suddenly, for the FAA to say, hold on, we're not just going to be handing out astronaut wings to everyone who can afford a seat, you have to actually do something that contributes to research or science. Yeah, I think that that, you know, potentially sort of may have deflated some of the heft of the marketing sell that they and Blue Origin probably were planning to make. And I think that's what's so intriguing and fascinating about this company, and in this world, are that tension between the real sort of engineering stuff, and the more, you know, the more vapid, if you will, kind of rhetoric about what they're going to do in the process of making rich people, space tourists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we'll go into that more gritty behind the scenes stuff in part two, but just what you've been saying leads on to I guess, the big question that people started really asking, you know, with those Bezos and Branson flights, is that is it? Is this worth it? Because there's an argument that given the climate crisis, we should really be focused on saving our planet, rather than sending people into space, which of course generates a lot of pollution. So I mean, what would you say to that? Are there any other counter arguments worth considering? And maybe we can look a bit beyond Virgin Galactic to that because as you say, Musk's project and Bezos, is there a little bit more focus on that space exploration side?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, totally. I mean, I think I don't have the data right in front of me, but SpaceX, Elon Musk's venture, they have lowered the cost, the launch costs; essentially what it takes to get a pound or a kilogramme of cargo into space, whether it's a satellite or whether it's to supply the International Space Station, they have lowered that cost significantly and by allowing larger satellite deployments you're providing internet access to previously uncovered areas of the world. I think that's important. I think that's really significant. And I think that your offering, you know, whether it's clarity of phone service, or its clarity of GPS services, that's real science, and I think that they are doing that. And I think that they are also looking beyond and you know, in terms of the deep space exploration, Elon Musk has always made it clear from the get go that everything for him is a step along the way to ultimately colonising Mars. I have heard Branson express what his quote unquote hopes and dreams are. And there was in 2016 as Virgin Galactic was unveiling its newly built spaceship after the 2014 crash, there was a reporter asked the very question you're sort of asking now, and Branson said he had just come back from Washington and he was meeting with a senator. And he was telling this senator that Virgin Galactic after they sort of master the space tourism thing that they're going to look deep, and they're going to start thinking about how they can, you know, zap asteroids and things like that. And I was like, talk about putting the cart before the horse. Yeah, we're light years away from that. And so I have never heard though, a long term, sort of deep space exploration argument or seen any documentation of any initiatives of Virgin Galactic. I think the goal was always to, you know, to create the space tourism company. So it's a long winded way of saying, Yes, on the Elon Musk stuff. Bezos is also trying to build a lunar lander. There are scientific priorities there. I don't know that they are as present with Virgin Galactic programme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks, Nick. Now we've got a handle on where we're at and the new space race and a bit we'll go back to look at the lives of the people that make it happen. A word now from our producer Alice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice Bloch:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You're listening to &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; magazine, where Niki here is deputy editor.

Perfect, back now to Niki and Nick Schmidle on the 21st century space race.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Nick, &lt;em&gt;Test Gods&lt;/em&gt; has been compared to that classic work of 70s New Journalism, Tom Wolfe's &lt;em&gt;The Right Stuff&lt;/em&gt;, which documented the lives of NASA's test pilots and astronauts. But this seems to be the first major work to focus on private space companies. Why do you think it's been such a neglected subject?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Partially because access has been very difficult. It is hard because of the corporate priorities and because of the competition. These companies have been understandably reluctant, wary of letting outsiders in, of letting reporters in that they don't know and don't trust. There was a great book that came out about SpaceX just this spring called Lift Off that does sort of get into the early SpaceX stuff but you know when I say early it's, you know, when SpaceX was launching rockets off this missiles sort of you know, crazy James Bond villain stuff they had. They had this this island in the middle of the South Pacific in which they were launching rockets. There were anecdotes of rockets going up in the air and then turning around and like coming straight back down, and everybody's scattering and then them having to, you know, don scuba gear to recover parts from the coral reefs. I mean, that's pretty crazy stuff. But following the kind of day to day travails of these companies has been really difficult for all those reasons. I mean, these people are, often the employees are covered and covered by NDA, etc. So it's been, I think it's been a challenge. When I went to Virgin Galactic on behalf of the New Yorker, initially, I said, I want to write about the programme. But we want real real access. My editor said, you know, only we're only interested if we can get real access. And by that, we meant that we wanted to watch them work. We didn't want a sort of Richard Branson led dog and pony show in which I show up in Mojave, and I spent a day there and he, you know, I do a couple of interviews, and then the piece ends inevitably with a quote from Richard Branson saying, &amp;ldquo;You know, hopefully next year is going to be the big year like we wanted&amp;rdquo;. We wanted there to be something real to see and real to report. So I mean, it was my timing was fortuitous, the company had just had this horrible crash and I said, I want to watch you all do the work, I wanted to watch them kind of rise from the ashes and see if they could build another spaceship and make a go of this as a company. They had flown three previous rocket-powered test flights. The fourth one is the one that crashed and I said, I want to stay with you until you fly the fifth rocket flights I want to watch you build a new ship, put it through a flight test programme, and get back to where you were - essentially the day of the morning of the crash on October 31 2014. And so I went in, and we thought that was going to be maybe 18 months, maybe two years. And it ended up being four years. And once you're in a company like that, once you're in anywhere as a reporter, you know, you try and take advantage of that access and make it so that when the access ultimately comes to an end, you can continue to report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On that crash that seriously injured the pilot, and it killed the co-pilot Michael Ellsbury, there were accusations at the time, and the investigation later found that there were inadequate safety procedures and a lack of rigorous oversight. Can you just comment on this idea that maybe private profit-driven companies are more likely to cut corners? Or would you say that that was an accident that could have just as easily happened at NASA and that, you know, these flights are risky by their very nature?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's a great question. I would find it very hard to think that that kind of accident could have occurred at NASA in 2014. Could that kind of accident have occurred at NASA in the early 60s when they were charging hard to try to beat the Soviets into space? Yeah, totally. I think it would be much more likely. But I think that as a result of the layers upon layers of bureaucracy, and therefore risk aversion that have crept into NASA, it is very hard to imagine that a pilot committing the kind of error that Mike Ellsbury unfortunately committed that morning, that there would have been what they call a single point failure on a NASA vehicle that would have allowed a single pilot mistake to have led to the crash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So we've talked a little bit about that heroism of astronauts. Obviously, they're dealing with this risk, and it seems a good time to mention a piece from the &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; archive that speaks to that. So this piece is called &lt;em&gt;In Praise of Astronauts&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Sims, and it was about Chris Hadfield. So Hadfield, this NASA astronaut who built up a huge cult following after broadcasting from the International Space Station starting in 2012. And that piece notes that while they might be held up as these national heroes most astronauts seem to understand that their work transcends their own individual success or that of their country and see it as instead being for the benefit of all humankind. Did the astronauts you spoke to a Virgin Galactic share that same kind of spirit?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, I mean, that's a highfalutin high-minded appraisal of one's contributions. I think I'm not diminishing that. I'm not suggesting that Hadfield or any of the other any other astronaut doesn't. I'm not questioning the integrity of the statement. But what I think and what drew me to the project was Mark Stuckey who's the test pilot who I really profiled in the book. Stuckey&amp;rsquo;s quest to become an astronaut first through NASA later through Scaled Composites where he was the test pilot there and then ultimately with Virgin Galactic - you know, this was a personal goal that he had been chasing since he was a kid. He had in the process lost his family lost friends. And you know it for me, it was like a bigger story. It was a story about family and about fatherhood and about what we're sort of willing to give up in order to chase those dreams and whether in some ways it's kind of worth it in the end. And his willingness to open up himself and his, you know, his files and his email inbox in his house, and a lot of painful memories of you know, him being estranged from his children after a really nasty divorce. And that, to me, that level of intimacy and grittiness and reality was something that I never, but it was unfamiliar from other astronaut profiles. And so that's in some ways what I appreciated and I think what drew me to him, he felt real. He was doing this because it was something he'd always wanted to do. And you know, ultimately when he became an astronaut, and he flew the successful mission and I spent that evening with him, we went back to his house and he opened up an expensive bottle of whiskey and it was, you know, he and I and his wife, second wife, and I was like, well so you know, what do you think? You know, is it is it everything you sort of hoped it would be? And you know, there's a little bit of a shrug and he was like, &amp;lsquo;Yeah, it's pretty cool&amp;rsquo;. But like, you could tell that it hadn't changed his outlook radically but um, you know, it was it was it was good for him. I'm sure he was incredibly relieved and proud and satisfied but you know, I think this was a personal quest and, you know, many of us are all sort of on these you know, personal quest and his willingness to get real was what was ultimately kind of what held my interest for all these years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And is it right that your father trained Stuckey at Top Gun, the elite fighter pilot school?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So both my dad and Stuckey are Top Gun graduates but my father was an instructor at the dogfighting school. All marine fighter pilots go through the school in Yuma Arizona, where you learn how to be a fighter pilot and my dad was an instructor there when Stuckey was a student there. They overlapped in time. They may have sort of been in some seminars together, they may have flown together once or twice but my dad wasn't schooling Mark in the ways of being a Top Gun student. They then diverged and went very different ways and Stuckey stayed in the Marines for another 10 years or so and then and then went to become a NASA test pilot and then the Air Force, and then ultimately got involved with the Virgin Galactic programme. My dad stayed in the Marines and eventually became a three star general and head of all aviation in the Marine Corps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You use &lt;em&gt;Test Gods&lt;/em&gt; in part to explore some of your attitudes to masculinity, which is as much to do with your relationship with Stuckey and the other pilots as your reflections on your relationship with your father. Can you just comment on that and maybe also just on the general macho culture of pilots?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it is a macho culture and it's potentially why I I'm not a pilot. I was back in the States last month and was at a wedding and my dad my brother, my cousins my uncle - every male above the age of 10 and below the age of 70 in my family has served in the military in some way shape or form and I haven't. I'm interested in that world but it's not like it's my world. But one of the things that I wrestled with as I started writing the book was appreciating what it was I got from my dad when I was growing up. In some ways I rebelled against that, I resisted, but there was always this notion when I was growing up that you know, my dad was a fighter pilot and is a has a PhD in philosophy and lectures at the Sorbonne and also raced motorcycles and growing up in his there was never a question of could you do something you wanted to do, it was like No, just put one foot in front of the other and do it. But also my dad was not around very much. There was a little bit of physical distance and an emotional distance. And I remember a few years ago thinking, alright, what how do I give that to my children? How do I get that too? I have two sons that are 10 and seven, how do I sort of inspire them? I am around more often, much more often than my dad was but so how do I sort of set that role model? How can I inspire but how can I also sort of be present and you know, in comfort and I don't think that I you know, I didn't come away with a golden answer to it. We were on a road trip in California and Virgin Galactic conducted its second spaceflight attempt. And I was able to bring my kids and was able to watch that flight with them on the flightline. And, you know, it was sort of life changing, I think for them and for me to be able to share that moment with them. And so that ultimately is what the book was, it was an exploration of relationships between fathers and sons and it's an exploration of masculinity. But it's not sort of an exploration of the traditional sort of hard-knuckled masculinity necessarily and it's all of us kind of trying to find what kind of man what kind of father what kind of son we want to be and so writing about test pilots was a way into that story, was kind of a vehicle to tell that story. But ultimately, I think the story is bigger than a story about test pilot or astronauts or certainly about, you know, a single company,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nick Schmidle, journalist and author of &lt;em&gt;Test Gods&lt;/em&gt;. Thank you so much for joining us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for having me. It's been fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I'm back now with Samira, who has been listening along to the conversation. So I learned a lot from talking to Nick and he did mention Musk's goal to land humans on Mars, but we didn't get much chance to talk in depth about that, or about Space X&amp;rsquo;s contract with NASA to land astronauts on the moon by 2024. And I just I just wondered what you thought about all that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, 2024 seems like quite an arbitrary target, I thought as I was reading about it. Apparently this was set in the Trump era as he'd hoped it would be the crowning glory on his second term, obviously didn't work out like that. But I thought that was a reminder of how space travel&amp;rsquo;s still so intimately tied to this idea of national glory and so on. Even if the space race seems to be shifting to one that's predominantly being fought between billionaires, rather than this competition between nation states as it was in the Cold War era. I guess it's still, even though you have these kind of big masculine egos vying with each other, you still do have a sense that we're in which space exploration, you know, refracts back on to our national politics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, you imagined that there has to be some tensions there between the aims of these sort of billionaire individuals and of government programmes, Musk said that he wants to colonise Mars as a self-sustaining civilization. And he said various things in various speeches, basically, about preserving our species from different disasters. He's mentioned the advent of World War Three and described Mars as a backup plan. So it seems it seems a little bit bizarre that he's working with NASA to be honest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I guess it's indicative of how much the dynamics of space travel have changed. So I wonder if it's NASA losing its total monopoly on space travel, but I guess those in favour of the move would make the same arguments that are always made about private public partnerships. So just the idea of bringing efficiency and competition to the space sector and bringing down the cost of space travel, and so on, which it does seem that that Musk's company has done. I don't know, I guess as you allude to, it does just seem there's a big gulf between the quest for scientific knowledge and so on that that is NASA's mission statement and the idea of billionaires wanting to colonise other planets or flog tickets to other planets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, and I get your point about the private public partnerships, but it did, did put me in mind at that just absolute contrast between those sort of the ego driven progress and say what Carlo Rovelli was saying in the context of quantum mechanics, you know, just his point that, that sense of, you know, mystery and humbleness and discovery and uncertainty, just all of those being really primary kind of driving forces of cutting edge scientific inquiry. So yeah, it just couldn't be a bigger contrast there. Okay, so that's it from us today. But remember, you can listen back to past episodes like the Carlo Rovelli one, whenever you like, on whatever app you use, and if you hit subscribe, you'll have them delivered straight to you when they're ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that's it too for series three of &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt;. You've been listening to me Samira Shackle and to Niki Seth-Smith. Our executive producer and fellow presenter in other episodes is Alice Bloch. And our sound engineer was Dave Crackles. Take care and we'll see you soon.

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

    <title>*Out of Office Response* Re: quick question?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/19/office-response-re-quick-question/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let’s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook’s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>
