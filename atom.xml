<p class="lead">I was inspired by this essay by Amal El-Mohtar, who is building a tradition of finding <a href="https://amalelmohtar.com/a-new-years-bird/">A New Year’s Bird</a>. I like it, it seems like a lovely way to start the year, but I’m not much of a bird person — that’s my wife’s thing. By the way, Mary is right next to me, staring out the window at the visitors to our bird feeders as part of her participation in <a href="https://feederwatch.org/">FeederWatch</a>. But you know me, I’m more of a spider person. Sorry. Not sorry.</p>
<p>It was clear, though, that I need a New Year’s Spider. I began my quest.</p>
<p>One easy possibility was that, this morning, as I showered and reached into the soap dish, I startled a small cellar spider, which scurried frantically away. I girded myself with my camera and walked the few feet to our bathroom to search for the little fellow.</p>
<p>I failed. It was not there any longer. That was OK, though, because that is how all quests must begin, with failure and frustration, and we then find redemption through struggle. I will find the beast.</p>
<p>The bathroom had to be explored. The lights above the bathtub are separated by a grid, a hot spot for spider webs, and there was plenty of spoor. The space was dusty and full of cobwebs, and I searched everywhere, finding diaphanous fluff everywhere, but not a hint of the spider. They are cunning and cautious, and are good at finding small cracks in the walls and hiding in the space between the drywall and siding, inaccessible to giants like me.</p>
<p>Where must I go? There’s no doubt. At some point in a quest, we must descend into the underworld. Our basement, that is — a dark, cold place, neglected and unfrequented by people, where we never dust or clean, where spider-kind can flourish. But again, this is mid-winter, and even spiders struggle when the cold obliterates their prey, and survival is a matter of patience and stillness and long waiting. I lit a torch, opened the creaking, little-used door, and descended the narrow stairs into the cavern.</p>
<p>The space is mostly empty, containing a few dusty relics from a time when it was inhabited by boisterous teenagers, but now barren of anything that might attract a human visitation, except, in my case, billowing cobwebs. Those cobwebs were all empty of life, unfortunately. Not even spiders find this basement an oasis in the depths of winter — too cool, too empty of food, too gloomy. I searched the main room and found a few traces of previous occupation, mainly molted skeletons lying about like the carcasses of facehuggers. Where are they now, I wondered? What victims were drained of blood after they shed their cuticle?</p>
<p>Further. I went deeper, and found the basement ogre: a large sheet web, a meter across, with scraps of cuticle scattered about, and imbedded in the area the skeletons of large prey, houseflies and bumblebees, that had stumbled into this cursed place and found their doom. There was movement on the sheet! I briefly glimpsed a large funnel weaver, horrified by the bright light I’d brought into their domain. It immediately scuttled back into it’s lair, refusing to face me. I could not count this as my New Year’s Spider. I needed a bold creature that would face me, stare into my eyes, and not retreat like a coward. There was no honor in this spider.</p>
<p>Deeper still, I went into the small twisty rooms in the back, where the furnace burned. What I immediately found was…death. The spiders had retreated into the faint warmth as cold seeped into the underworld, finding final refuge where the hot heart of the house dwelt, and many had died in the process. So many spider corpses! So many large carcasses dead in their webs, on the wall, on the ceiling.</p>
<p>I knew I was close. How else would a quest go? First the barren land, then the monster in the dark, then death, then finally, the grail and revelation. There she was, queen of the dark world, my New Year’s Spider, resting on the underside of a shelf, gazing unafraid and unmoving at me.<br/>
Returning to the land of light, I can now rest with a sense of accomplishment, perhaps ready for a new year. As one who has returned, I can now give you a quest, to find your own New Year’s Spider.</p>
<p>Or bird, I guess, if you prefer.</p>
<p>(I know way too many people here are Bird Persons who don’t much care for spiders, so I only posted the text here, with none of the photos of horrifying spider webs, dead spiders, and the Queen of Darkness. You could see all the grisly photos if you’re subscribed to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-years-spider-60637121">Patreon</a>, or you can see the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYPKTSULQce/">spider queen on Instagram</a>.)</p>

    <title>What? You mean creationists lie about the scientific literature?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/01/01/what-you-mean-creationists-lie-about-the-scientific-literature/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;I had to look at what they were saying about these beautiful animals, and &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;shock, horror&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; they are lying about their evolution. Oh well, it gave me a chance to compare ID creationists to YE creationists. There is a little difference there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Script below the fold for all of you who hate watching videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-65098"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, friends &amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I wrote a blog post critiquing an article by the intelligent design creationists that tried to claim that spiders are intelligently designed, which, as you must know, is a claim I&amp;#8217;m not going to let stand. I&amp;#8217;ll include a link to the blog post down below, but just to give you a quick overview, here are the main points I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID creationists have one argument, and only one, which they constantly resort to. That argument is that X is too complicated to have evolved, therefore X must have been designed. You can substitute anything for X: the cell, the flagellum, the blood clotting pathway, or in this case, the spider web. It gives short shrift to the kind of chaotic complexity that evolution can easily generate, and also over-rates the power of human engineering. In this case, the creationist says, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Despite great effort, humans have yet to produce anything functionally equivalent to silk,&amp;#8221; that human &amp;#8220;attempts to duplicate it have been made without success,&amp;#8221; and yet, this is evidence that spider silk is the product of &amp;#8220;advanced engineering&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t have it both ways. Does it look engineered, or is it incapable of being engineered? It looks to me like the score is engineering 0, evolution 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s their argument, and then what they try to do to validate it is to butcher legitimate scientific papers. A lot of Intelligent Design &amp;#8220;research&amp;#8221; consists of searching the scientific literature for fragments of sentences, even just word, that they can then cherry-pick to pretend good science supports their bad science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s an example of their tactics for supporting their claims: the ever-useful and ever-obvious quote-mine. So the author quotes William Shear, a legitimate arachnologist and evolutionary biologist, as conceding that &amp;#8220;a functional explanation for the origins of silk and the spinning habit may be impossible to achieve,&amp;#8221; period. That&amp;#8217;s from an article title &amp;#8220;Untangling the Evolution of the Web,&amp;#8221; and it doesn&amp;#8217;t end with a period in the article. It actually continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A functional explanation for the origins of silk and the spinning habit may be impossible to achieve, but the evolution of silk-spinning organs has been studied, and debated, extensively. Revealing evidence has come from the histology of silk glands — the details of their cellular construction — and from the embryological development of the spinnerets themselves. Histological evidence allows us to draw connections, or homologies, between silk glands in different spider groups, and embryology shows clearly that the spinnerets are paired abdominal appendages, with the silk issuing from modified setae, or hairs. So much information is available on the anatomy of the spinning apparatus, in fact, that the traditional view of web evolution rests heavily on a classification derived from the form and position of spinnerets.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of the article is that we do have good evidence for phylogeny of spiders and spider webs! Shear even included a clear, simple phylogenetic tree illustrating his point! How could the creationist have missed it? Well, that&amp;#8217;s easy to explain: it was intentional and dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s how intelligent design creationists handle the science that conflicts with their beliefs, by contradicting themselves and misrepresenting the evidence. In an idle moment, I wondered how the classical creationists &amp;#8212; you know, the ones who openly state that they won&amp;#8217;t believe it if it isn&amp;#8217;t written in their bible, except when they invent excuses to prop up the authority of their bible &amp;#8212; so I decided to look on the Answers in Genesis website for their articles about spiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there aren&amp;#8217;t many. I guess spiders are awkward for Biblical creationists. For one thing, they have to ignore that approximately 80,000 spider species had to arise in the 4500 years since the planet-wide extinction event called Noah&amp;#8217;s flood. For another, spiders are obligate carnivores, they are all, with one exception I know of, predators who live by killing other animals and sucking their fluids out &amp;#8212; their fangs and mouthparts are a hallmark of the group. They&amp;#8217;re chelicerates! Look at that face! Does that look like the face of a vegan? According to their interpretation of the bible, all animals were vegetarians before the fall, which is a bit problematic if spiders were in the Garden of Eden. So they don&amp;#8217;t have much to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do have a longish article asking whether insects were on the ark, which I&amp;#8217;ll link to down below because it&amp;#8217;s hilarious (invertebrates don&amp;#8217;t have blood or flesh or lungs (not true, spiders have all three), and they apparently all breed in swarms with a queen (false)). It&amp;#8217;s a terribly stupid article which I won&amp;#8217;t address here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find one spider article on the AIG website: &amp;#8220;Spectacular Spider Fossils—How Do We Explain the Evidence?&amp;#8221; Spoiler: they don&amp;#8217;t. They try to explain it away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Earth creationists do take a different angle than Intelligent Design creationists. One significant difference is that for YECs complexity isn&amp;#8217;t the issue &amp;#8212; God can make things as complicated as they need to be after all. For these guys, the main concern is fitting everything into the compressed, young earth chronology. What they have to do is explain away any dates that scientists have measured, and then reconcile the observations to a catastrophic flood. The particular paper they&amp;#8217;re going to try and wave their hands over is a fairly mundane one, in the sense that it&amp;#8217;s just a set of observations of fossil spiders &amp;#8212; spectacular fossils! &amp;#8212; but even the basic facts of these animals is enough to disrupt their whole biblical model, so they&amp;#8217;ve got to struggle to bury the observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They fail, of course. It&amp;#8217;s not even a good effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the paper: &amp;#8220;A diverse new spider (Araneae) fauna from the Jinju Formation, Cretaceous (Albian) of Korea&amp;#8221; by Park, Nam, and Selden. I&amp;#8217;m going to summarize it accurately first, then we&amp;#8217;ll see how Answers in Genesis mangles it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a good descriptive paper. Basically, it&amp;#8217;s a small part of the vast body of evidence that describes the history of life on Earth; Park and associates are characterizing a number of fossils extracted from a specific fossil bed, the Jinju formation of Korea. The Jinju formation is about 800 meters thick, spanning about 4 million years of layered accumulation of sediments in the Cretaceous, about 110 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they find in layers and layers of dark slate slabs are compressed fossils &amp;#8212; organisms that were flattened over long eras of geological time. The site is the location of an ancient basin near the sea, that was primarily filled with fresh water but there were also occasional incursions of marine organisms. The mechanism of fossil formation is that this was often a site of stagnant ponds where the water was hypoxic, with a slow drift of very fine sediments. So an invertebrate would be blown into the water to drown and settle into the soft silt at the bottom, and be covered with a fine thin layer of sediment. It would be slow to decay because of the lack of oxygen, and would be compressed by years and years of building sediments. Eventually it would be reduced to a compressed, nearly 2 dimensional sheet of mineralized stone. I&amp;#8217;ve been fossil hunting in slate deposits in Utah, and they&amp;#8217;re cool &amp;#8212; you tap the slate with a rock hammer, and it splits neatly along a bedding plane and you end up with a part and counterpart. Same here in Korea. They find diverse invertebrates, plants, and fossilized microbial mats, or stromatolites, but the paper here focuses on just the spiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aren&amp;#8217;t they lovely? These are squashed flat, but the detail is preserved, right down to the hairs on their limbs. They also found good evidence of tapeta in some of the fossils &amp;#8212; the tapetum is a reflective layer at the back of the eye that bounces light back through the retina, increasing the sensitivity of the eye. They&amp;#8217;re quite common in nocturnal mammals; cats and deer and raccoons, for instance, have eyeshine, eyes that reflect back any light shined on them. Humans, unfortunately, lack a tapetum. The Parasteatoda spiders I raise in the lab have a tapetum on just the posterior median eyes. This fossil assemblage reveals that spiders at least 100 million years ago also had them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Answers in Genesis make of this paper? There&amp;#8217;s not much they can do with it. The fact that the fossils are over 110 million years old &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s just the &amp;#8220;conventional dating&amp;#8221;, you know. Of course, those dates are confirmed by multiple lines of evidence and are concordant with other dated fossil beds. but they&amp;#8217;re going to just ignore that. The creationists frequently make the argument that they&amp;#8217;re all looking at the same evidence, they&amp;#8217;re just interpreting it differently. That is a lie: they actually ignore most of the evidence and only talk about the excerpts they can warp to fit their terrible model of origins, which is actually falsifed by the bulk of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the only attempt made to justify believing these fossils are only a few thousand years old. &amp;#8220;To propose that this level of fine detail could be preserved 110 million years strains credulity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Is there a time limit on how long a rock can be stable? Do they have evidence that it is impossible for mineral structures that are a few tens or hundreds of microns to persist for millions of years? They&amp;#8217;re just trying to sow unwarranted doubt with this quote, rather than trying to address all the evidence that says this rock is 100 million years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even that is not their most desperate straining of the truth. The fine structure of these fossil spiders are extraordinarily well preserved. From the scientific point of view, this tells us that they were preserved by the gentle deposition of very fine sediments, in a hypoxic environment that slowed the rate of decay. The creationist argues that these small, fragile arthropods are so well-preserved that they had to have been buried &amp;#8220;catastrophically and immediately&amp;#8221;, in a colossal world-wide washing machine of a storm, a cataclysm so great that it tore the continents apart, gauged deep canyons, destroyed forests, threw up thousands of feet of rock, yet somehow it simultaneously gently laid down a lot of spiders in basins that somehow avoided the churning chaos of the flood to remain calm, static, and oxygen free. That&amp;#8217;s pretty much the standard kind of contradiction that emerges from any attempt to shoe-horn 4.5 billion years into 6000 years, and worse, trying to argue that all the major features of planetary geology were generated in a one year long event about 4000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony that they note is that stromatolites, or bacterial mats, were fossilized in layers 10-25 meters above the spiders. Somehow they think this indicates a large catastrophic event &amp;#8212; how? I don&amp;#8217;t understand! Did the flood sort everything into tidy layers? &amp;#8212; or that the stromatolites &amp;#8220;formed much later&amp;#8221;. Yeah? You think? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the article from the Discovery Institute and the one from Answers in Genesis are deeply stupid and dishonest, and I can&amp;#8217;t find any redeeming quality in either one. So what did I learn from this exercise? That the scientific literature is far more honest and detailed, and also just plain more interesting. I found some differences in the approach of the Intelligent Design creationists, like the Discovery Institute, and the Young Earth creationists, like Answers in Genesis, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ID creationists are frustratingly vague about the mechanism of their alternative to evolution, instead just insisting that evolution is wrong, therefore we must accept their useless and poorly defined and nonexistent design mechanism. The Young Earth creationists, on the other hand, insist instead on an absurd timeline that is contradicted by all of the available scientific evidence, which we&amp;#8217;re expected to accept because the bible says so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they have in common, though, is that both are incompetent at reading the scientific literature, which rather blunts their criticisms. It may be that proponents of those irrational views are simply failing to understand and interpret the evidence, but I more charitably interpret their behavior as the work of intelligent human beings who are intentionally misrepresenting the evidence to rationalize their untenable ideas. So don&amp;#8217;t read their work, it&amp;#8217;s worthless, even if I do cite it below. Instead read the legitimate work which I also cite &amp;#8212; good, interesting papers that tell us something true about the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, spiders evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Book review: Variations</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5890/book-review-variations#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/61poUt_IqaL.jpg" height="1287" alt="61poUt_IqaL" width="586" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variations &lt;/strong&gt;(Influx Press) by Juliet Jacques&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who gets to speak in a literary text, and who gets to decide who speaks? Some critics may claim that talent is the only determinant of whether a writer makes it onto the published page, although the emerging female and queer voices &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo; from previous centuries and published to popular and critical acclaim show this cannot be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we should have that in mind while reading Juliet Jacques, whose voice and experience &amp;ndash; as well as the voices and experiences of the characters in her latest book, &lt;em&gt;Variations&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; have been brought into view in part thanks to the profound cultural change happening right now. Jacques&amp;rsquo; idiosyncratic, campy voice, her tendency to draw on seemingly disparate interests in cultures considered both &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; (from avant-garde art to football), combined with her perspective as a trans woman, make for a very rare quality. I have been an avid reader of Jacques for some years, from when she first raised LGBTQ+ issues as a journalist and told her own history of transitioning in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, to her remarkable &lt;em&gt;Trans: A Memoir&lt;/em&gt;. Appearing in 2015, the book displayed her characteristic combination of dry, self-deprecating humour and stunning erudition, but also her surprising tenderness in depicting her family&amp;rsquo;s reactions and her social surroundings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variations&lt;/em&gt; is the most mature and ambitious Jacques work to date. It&amp;rsquo;s conceived as a series of fictionalised stories, each told in a different literary form: a film script, an epistolary novel, a found diary, even a medical report. In each, a fictional character gives voice to a different side of the reality of queer life in Britain. It is, in its own way, her version of &lt;em&gt;Small Lives&lt;/em&gt; by Pierre Michon, which told the stories of various characters from his family&amp;rsquo;s ancient history and of the peripheral figures from his hometown whose lives would have usually been considered too insignificant for literature &amp;ndash; a servant, a hobo, a peasant priest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Jacques&amp;rsquo; version, it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of class and marginalisation based on sexual orientation. &amp;ldquo;A Wo/Man of No Importance&amp;rdquo;, the story of Arthur Parr, fictitious contemporary of Oscar Wilde, is a pretext for a highly camp journey into Wilde&amp;rsquo;s trial against the Marquess of Queensberry, his fight for the respect of his queer contemporaries, and the right to live a life without labels. My favourite is &amp;ldquo;Standards of Care&amp;rdquo;, the fictionalised diary of a transgender woman called Sandy, living in Manchester, whose backstory is glam rock fandom and the development of punk culture around 1977.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Queer socialist utopia&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glam was an obvious refuge for queers, who could experiment with drag, crossdressing and identity without being necessarily spat at on the street (which happens to many of the other characters). Sandy frequents a clinic in London to be assessed for gender correction surgery. There she meets Elena and other transgender women whose devotion to music and bravery in self-expression unite them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Culture, along with makeup and clothes, plays just as important a role in these stories as radical politics. The queerness of the characters is never their most important attribute and the period details are rigorously researched. &amp;ldquo;Exhibition&amp;rdquo;, for instance, is an epistolary story set in 1939 Blackpool, where the woman-born, man-identifying protagonist spends two months in the House of Curiosities by the seaside promenade. There, he performs a reality-TV-like show, watched from behind a glass &amp;ndash; as a desperate ploy to make money, but also as an attempt to finally live as who he feels he is, in the face of the very society denying him his identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variations&lt;/em&gt; must be the only book in the world to mention the mid-century social research project &amp;ldquo;Mass Observation&amp;rdquo; in the same breath as the 1970s glam rock inventors and eager crossdressers, the New York Dolls, along with countless other snippets of life and culture, a large canvas on which the pattern for a utopian socialist queer life might be inscribed. This is a touching, delightful collection from a vital voice, making you want to struggle for a different world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Q&amp;A: Claire Tomalin</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5907/qa-claire-tomalin#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Claire Tomalin (copyright: Angus Muir)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Claire-Tomalin-NEW-2011-credit-Angus-Muir.jpg" height="851" width="1277" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claire Tomalin was the literary editor at the &lt;/em&gt;New Statesman&lt;em&gt;, and then later at the &lt;/em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;em&gt;. She then embarked on successful career as a full-time writer. Her first book, "The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft", won the Whitbread First Book Award, and she has since written a number of highly acclaimed, award-winning and bestselling biographies. They include: "Jane Austen: A Life", and "Charles Dickens: A Life". Tomalin's latest book is "The Young H.G. Wells: Changing the World".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a teenager, at Uppark, Sussex, H.G. Wells had the good fortune of discovering the work of many great writers and thinkers. How important was that formative moment in shaping his artistic and intellectual abilities later on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experience of finding those books at Uppark was absolutely crucial in Wells's life. His mother was a servant in a gentry country house there. And when visiting his mother, Wells suddenly found he had access to an extraordinary range of books from the library he found in the servants&amp;rsquo; quarters. He discovered the works of Plato, Voltaire, Thomas Paine, and Jonathan Swift. One of the fascinating things about Wells is that he came from poverty. But this formative reading moment opened up his mind to a whole new world of ideas and possibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was Wells a working class hero?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He knew that he was getting out of the working class. He said to his mother: "If you could make me be a draper's apprentice, then I will stay as a draper's apprentice forever, but if you let me go to school and study at university, I will rise up." And that is what happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells is often credited as being a kind of father figure for the science fiction genre. Why were books like &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt; (1895) and &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; (1898) considered so fresh and modern at the time they were published?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are just marvellous stories that are vividly and plainly well written. Wells also had an extraordinary imagination. He deserves to be regarded as a great, great English storyteller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many critics often draw distinctions between Wells's science fiction work and his literary realism. The general consensus seems to be the science fiction was far better. Do you agree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A book like &lt;em&gt;Joan and Peter &lt;/em&gt;(1918), for example, is okay, but it's much more like a conventional English novel, and doesn't approach the thrill of those early [science fiction stories]. Why that happened I cannot say. I suppose Wells just got old and lost his sparkle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells also wrote a great deal of polemical non-fiction. Your biography look at books like &lt;em&gt;Anticipations &lt;/em&gt;(1901), where Wells was making a claim to forecast the future in areas like transport, social activities, education, and warfare. And &lt;em&gt;Misery Boots&lt;/em&gt; (1907): a political tract advocating socialism. Were these two books his strongest works of non-fiction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Misery Boots&lt;/em&gt; is a wonderful political pamphlet. And &lt;em&gt;Anticipations&lt;/em&gt; is absolutely terrific too. I wouldn't be able to say which is the best. They are just all very interesting and impressive. When people like George Bernard Shaw, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb read Wells, they realised how extraordinary he was. Which is why they were so keen to get him into the Fabian Society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells's relationship with the Fabian Society was controversial. Why did he fall out with them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was overly ambitious. He wanted to to enlarge The Fabian Society, and he wanted to change it by spending a lot of money. But Beatrice and Sidney Webb [who were early members of the organisation], and many others, realised this was not a realistic scheme. The Fabian Society was very influential. But it wasn't rich. So that was part of the problem. And then Wells had an affair with Amber Reeves, who was a the daughter of William Pember Reeves and Maud Pember Reeves: two prominent members of the Fabian Society. This sexual scandal was regarded as unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells married twice, first to his cousin, Isabel Mary Wells, before beginning an affair with Amy Catherine Robbins, who he later married. But Wells had many other lovers throughout his life. Could he be cruel in love, or did he just have a very open attitude to relationships and sex?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think Wells didn't mean to be cruel to the women he was with. But he did have this very powerful attraction to women. He was also absolutely insistent on having sexual freedom. Wells wanted everything. He wanted to have a lovely loyal wife, who could entertain his friends at home. But he also wanted to have a passionate love affairs. Actually, he got most of what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there one particular romantic affair Wells embarked on that stands out to you as especially passionate or intense?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The affair with the English writer, Rebecca West, was very long drawn out, and probably the most intense affair of Wells's life. That's partially why I stopped the book before that period of his life. It's a whole new chapter, and that's been written about, in depth, by many people. And, of course, West was such a powerful woman herself. But Wells's affair with Amber Reeves was very interesting too. She was this beautiful young student at Cambridge. She really initiated the affair, and asked Wells to make her pregnant. If you read the letters between both of them they are extraordinary. Long afterwards, when she was happily married, she always retained her feelings for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wells's bibliography contains an impressive 3,000 items, including more than 100 books. He was quite a hard worker and extremely prolific with his pen it seems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At one stage of his writing career Wells was churning out 7,000 words a day. It almost seemed like he had a team of writers working for him. This was an extraordinary side to his working life: how much writing he actually produced. He also had the capacity to do lots of other things. He had an intense energy. As well as writing, he was engaged in all sorts of travel. And, of course, he was engaged in many relationships with many different women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You've written biographies documenting the lives of writers like Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Thomas Hardy. How does Wells's life compare to them? Was it more eventful and interesting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well my first biography was on the life of Mary Wollstonecraft. She had a pretty eventful life. So too did Charles Dickens. I've enjoyed writing about Wells, but I'm not sure if his life was more interesting than any of the other writers I've written about. Wells lived through very interesting times. But then so too did those other writers I've written about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the secret to writing a great biography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each biography one embarks on is like forming a close friendship, or close relationship, and trying to be as understanding and tolerant as you can, so you can then investigate as much as you can into that person's life. Of course, you can't catch everything. Nobody can catch everything about another person's life.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Top 20 of 2021</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5898/top-20-of-2021#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2021-12-27-at-11.13.02.jpg" height="835" alt="Screenshot-2021-12-27-at-11.13.02" width="1075" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's been a long year. At many points, it felt as if the doomed 2020 had stretched well into 2021. The media continued to bear bad news, and reflections on the experience of grief, isolation, polarisation and other features of our social landscape continued to surface in everyday discussions. But so too did stories of hope and empowerment, along with heartening developments in science and technology. At &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt;, we continued to shine a light on worrying trends in our "post-truth" era, championing reason and free inquiry at a time when these principles are under great threat. In our Top 20 articles of the year, our authors engage with these themes and much more. We have also included episodes from our podcast &lt;a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061"&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We hope you enjoy these as much as we have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="/articles/5841/blasphemy-in-the-classroom"&gt;Blasphemy in the classroom&lt;/a&gt; by Emma Park&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In March, a grammar school in Kent was targeted by protestors angry at a teacher's showing of a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad. Soon after, Emma Park began to reflect on what this said about the state of free expression in Britain, and the all important question of how religious iconography is differently interpreted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href="/articles/5891/of-beasts-and-men"&gt;Of beasts and men&lt;/a&gt; by Julian Baggini&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parliament has been debating an Animal Sentience Bill that could finally see animals officially recognised as sentient creatures. It's high time this happened, Julian Baggini writes, but it doesn't provide the basis for an argument that meat-eating is a special kind of evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NEW_HUMANIST_WINTER_2v1aw2small.jpg" height="372" alt="NEW_HUMANIST_WINTER_2v1aw2small" width="494" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. &lt;a href="/articles/5802/our-national-need-for-grief"&gt;Our national need for grief&lt;/a&gt; by Samira Ahmed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pandemic cast a huge blanket of grief over Britain. Yet it feels like the tens of thousands of sudden deaths haven't been properly marked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/4398ad6427f6c3a8207b3ed667934a4b78058210/view"&gt;Writing and recovery&lt;/a&gt;: an interview with Michael Rosen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early 2020, the poet and author Michael Rosen almost died from Covid-19. He used his recuperation to reflect on the value of kindness, touch and practical atheism, and later spoke with New Humanist about the immorality of government decision-making around the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. &lt;a href="/articles/5784/talking-to-ourselves"&gt;Talking to Ourselves&lt;/a&gt; by Jon Moses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we pay them heed, our inner voices can shape our lives. They tell us what we should think, and how we should behave. But, writes Jon Moses, they have long been understudied. Should that change?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;7. &lt;a href="/articles/5859/power-shapes-human-health-and-infectious-diseases-shape-power"&gt;Disease and power&lt;/a&gt;: a Q&amp;amp;A with Kyle Harper&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several transformations in human history - the development of agriculture, the rise of cities, international travel - triggered profound changes in the way diseases evolve and pass between humans. Dr Kyle Harper, author of &lt;em&gt;Plagues Upon the Earth: Disease and the Course of Human History, &lt;/em&gt;gave us an overview of how we have shaped disease, and how it has shaped us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;8. &lt;a href="/articles/5827/lying-eyes"&gt;Lying Eyes&lt;/a&gt; by Gayan Samarisinghe&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Judges, juries, prosecutors and courtroom audiences can't but help look at the expressions of defendents to glean clues as to their guilt or innocence. But this is not only unscientific, writes Gayan Samarisinghe. It is a major cause of bias in criminal trials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/9ecf3706689beab926e28b8ce15b6ca0f96fcf91/view"&gt;How to fix the internet&lt;/a&gt;: an interview with Chris Bail&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Online tribalism is a growing threat, with real implications for offline safety. Chris Bail, head of the Polarization Lab, shared his thoughts on what strategies can best be used to tackle the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;9. &lt;a href="/articles/5846/why-does-every-hollywood-baddie-need-a-redemption-story"&gt;Scraping the Barrel&lt;/a&gt; by James Robins&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Hollywood film on the life and times of Cruella de Ville has flattened a complex villain into a likeable, redeemable character. But why do directors need to deliver feelgood stories, James Robins asks?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;10. &lt;a href="/articles/5899/the-curious-mind-of-a-dog"&gt;The curious mind of a dog&lt;/a&gt; by Cal Flyn&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several years ago, a speech pathologist began to wonder whether the strategies she uses to develop language skills in her young patients could be adapted in order to train dogs to "talk". As Cal Flyn found out, the results have been astonishing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistDog-small1.jpg" height="480" alt="NewHumanistDog-small1" width="535" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;11. &lt;a href="/articles/5857/a-good-death"&gt;A good death&lt;/a&gt; by Jem Bartholomew&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current laws around assisted dying in the UK mean that people who want to legally and painlessly end their lives have to travel abroad. But the tide is beginning to turn, writes Jem Bartholomew in a feature on the life, and death, of Rebecca Drury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;12. &lt;a href="/articles/5763/inside-diyarbak%C4%B1r-the-city-of-the-silenced"&gt;Inside Diyarbakir, the city of the silenced&lt;/a&gt; by Sami Kent&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diyarbakir is Turkey&amp;rsquo;s biggest Kurdish city, and its recent history is one marked by violence and unrelenting state oppression. But it also where the development of a recognisably 21st-century Kurdish city has found powerful expression, as Sami Kent discovered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;13. &lt;a href="/articles/5821/qa-ac-grayling"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with A.C. Grayling&lt;/a&gt; by Niki Seth-Smith&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I&amp;rsquo;ve always said that humanism is an ethical outlook," A.C. Grayling told us earlier this year, "which has its roots in Classical antiquity and which pretty well all reflective people have held close, right the way through the history of philosophy."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/oz1.jpg" height="432" alt="oz1" width="532" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;14. &lt;a href="/articles/5773/australias-dance-with-death"&gt;Australia's dance with death&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Salmon&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with neurosis in an individual&amp;rsquo;s psyche, Peter Salmon reflected, a neurosis in the psyche of a nation can battle on, impervious to the facts. Australia's position on looming environmental collapse is just such an example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/646f1bfd4c2adf1ec42391021aafc62ee374200f/view"&gt;The Cosmos &amp;amp; Us&lt;/a&gt;: an interview with Jo Marchant&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do we gain when we look to the skies? How has cosmology shaped our politics? And why is awe a feeling that we can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose? We spoke about this, and more, in a podcast with the science writer Jo Marchant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;16. &lt;a href="/articles/5816/remember-me"&gt;Remember me&lt;/a&gt; by Laurie Taylor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laurie Taylor spent much of the past year contacting old pals in the hope that long-dead friendships could be reborn. For the most part, he was wildly unsuccessful, and he came to learn a hard truth: they had gotten on just fine without him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;17. &lt;a href="/articles/5900/qa-eimear-mcbride"&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with Eimear McBride&lt;/a&gt; by J. P. O'Malley&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Irish novelist, whose book &lt;em&gt;A Girl Is A Half-formed Thing&lt;/em&gt; won the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize in 2013, spoke to us about objectification and disgust in representations of, and conversations around, women's bodies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Eimar_McBride_&amp;copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall1.jpg" height="328" alt="Eimar_McBride_&amp;copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall1" width="492" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;18. &lt;a href="/articles/5854/patron-saint-of-doom"&gt;Patron saint of doom&lt;/a&gt; by Tom Whyman&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many of us, Tom Whyman found the pandemic period to be full of dispiriting news. But after returning to the work of Arthur Schopenhauer, he understood that hope lay in properly interrogating the pessimistic mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;19. &lt;a href="/articles/5831/secrets-in-the-soil"&gt;Secrets in the soil&lt;/a&gt; by Kate Brown&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our problem of ravaged soils is one of the oldest in the history of agriculture.

    <title>In a word: refugee</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5905/in-a-word-refugee#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;img title="The word &amp;quot;refugee&amp;quot; has a rich history (Alpha Stock Images - http://alphastockimages.com/)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/refugee.jpg" height="800" alt="refugee" width="1200" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Refugee&amp;rdquo; overlaps with the French words &amp;ldquo;refuge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;refugier&amp;rdquo;, but the route into English starts out with some Latin forms of the word, like &amp;ldquo;refugium&amp;rdquo;, a place of shelter. Both in Latin and French, God was talked of as a &amp;ldquo;refuge&amp;rdquo;, a protector. Geoffrey Chaucer often marks an arrival of a French word into common English usage. In his &lt;em&gt;Knight&amp;rsquo;s Tale&lt;/em&gt; (c.1405), we find the phrase, &amp;ldquo;Give us neither mercy nor refuge, but slay me&amp;rdquo; (modernised spelling).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;The Oxford Dictionary lists the first example of &amp;ldquo;refugee&amp;rdquo; in the modern sense, attached to Protestants who fled religious persecution in France, especially after 1685 and the Edict of Nantes. In 1687, John Evelyn, in his famous &lt;em&gt;Diary, &lt;/em&gt;wrote of &amp;ldquo;the poor and religious Refugie&amp;egrave;s [sic] who escaped out of France in the cruel persecution&amp;rdquo;. Even so, a little earlier there are references to &amp;ldquo;poor refugees in Norwich, Colchester, Sandwich, Maidstone and Southampton&amp;rdquo;, a reminder that places some think of as &amp;ldquo;pure English&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means) have had their share of migrants from as far back as the 17th century. Daniel Defoe used the word in 1724, presumably in the knowledge that his readers were familiar with it, talking of &amp;ldquo;the people call&amp;rsquo;d refugees&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;In the slippery way that we all enjoy, we find writers using the word metaphorically or hyperbolically. A migratory bird could be described as a &amp;ldquo;refugee&amp;rdquo; (1764); Lawrence Durrell, in &lt;em&gt;Justine&lt;/em&gt; (1957), wrote: &amp;ldquo;You are a mental refugee of course, being Irish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;As we know only too well, the word can also be used in an inversion of its customary sense when the person is deemed unworthy: a refugee from the law and due punishment. This idea has been around since at least the 18th century. One Lady Miller, writing in 1777, first described refugees as &amp;ldquo;robbers and murderers&amp;rdquo;, before adding: &amp;ldquo;The soldiers seize the refugees and bring them to justice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s not clear from Lady Miller&amp;rsquo;s writing is whether this outcome was better or worse than having your dinghy turned round in the English Channel in 2021 and sent back to France.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Words as weapons</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5895/words-as-weapons#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Farmers block traffic at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border during a nationwide strike against agricultural reforms (Pradeep Gaur / SOPA Images/Sipa USA)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2GNTMGR.jpg" height="465" alt="2GNTMGR" width="700" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At noon on Saturday 13 February the writer Githa Hariharan appeared via Zoom at a literary festival organised by Shoolini University, 300 kilometres north of New Delhi where she lives. Looking wan and tense, Githa talked about her growth as a writer, from her Commonwealth Award-winning debut, &lt;em&gt;The Thousand Faces of Night&lt;/em&gt;, to her latest novel, &lt;em&gt;I Have Become the Tide&lt;/em&gt;, which deals with themes of justice and caste. Addressing an invisible audience from her computer screen, Githa&amp;rsquo;s tone grew urgent as she spoke of her literary values and her disagreement with the idea of writers as silver-tongued illusionists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no time &amp;ldquo;to wax lyrical&amp;rdquo;, she said, but &amp;ldquo;to use words as what they are, weapons&amp;rdquo;: the challenge is to discover solidarity, imagine multiplicity and connectedness. This is necessary, she added, if we are to resist the ascent of a &amp;ldquo;homogeneous story&amp;rdquo; which &amp;ldquo;invariably leads to the exclusion of people [&amp;hellip;] to censorship [&amp;hellip;] to what the poet Seamus Heaney called &amp;lsquo;the government of the tongue&amp;rsquo;, and today that&amp;rsquo;s where we are in our country&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;Githa&amp;rsquo;s words were all the more striking given her situation. It was four days since officials from the government&amp;rsquo;s financial investigation agency, the Enforcement Directorate, had confined her and her partner, Prabir Purkayastha, to their house, blocking them from contact with the outside world, including lawyers. Her appearance at the literature festival, by special leave, was the first glimpse of her since the enforced disappearance. Halfway through the interview, she noted that it was exactly 100 hours since the Enforcement Directorate had taken over her life. They would remain for another 14 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Githa and Prabir were effectively held hostage in their home, Narendra Modi&amp;rsquo;s government had been planting stories against them. That very morning, the &lt;em&gt;Indian Express&lt;/em&gt;, a leading national daily, had carried a report about some 30 crore rupees (&amp;pound;3 million) in foreign &amp;ldquo;remittances&amp;rdquo; received by Prabir&amp;rsquo;s media company, PPK NewsClick, payments the Enforcement Directorate was investigating. The report mentioned that the &lt;em&gt;Express&lt;/em&gt; had not heard back from emails and texts sent to Prabir and &lt;em&gt;NewsClick&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s editor, Pranjal Pandey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had the newspaper tried asking around, it would have discovered that no one could reach Prabir. When the raids began on the morning of 9 February, from the &lt;em&gt;NewsClick&lt;/em&gt; office to the homes of seven of its staff members &amp;ndash; including Prabir and Pranjal &amp;ndash; their access to phones and other electronic devices was suspended. As Githa addressed the Shoolini Literature Festival, the sleuthing carried on around her. The &lt;em&gt;Express &lt;/em&gt;was not alone with its one-sided report. On 9 February, another national daily, the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt;, had published the government&amp;rsquo;s claim that &lt;em&gt;NewsClick&lt;/em&gt; was being probed for money laundering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax raids, sedition and anti-terror laws&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raids like that on &lt;em&gt;NewsClick&lt;/em&gt; have become routine in India: between 2011 and 2020, over 1,700 raids were carried out in connection with 1,569 investigations of tax evasion and money laundering. Only nine cases in this period ended with a conviction in court. The real punishment arrives with the long wait for a trial: bank accounts are frozen and questioning continues, as do raids and the harassment of employees. &amp;ldquo;The process becomes the punishment,&amp;rdquo; as Prabir wryly sums it up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In July this year, after a devastating second wave of Covid exposed the government&amp;rsquo;s unpreparedness for a health crisis, both the television company Bharat Samachar and the Dainik Bhaskar Group, owner of one of the highest-circulating newspapers in Hindi, were raided &amp;ndash; the latter at over 30 locations in five states. The two media houses had reported on the discrepancy between the government&amp;rsquo;s low count of Covid fatalities and the real numbers logged by graveyards and cremation grounds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax raids have also been used against global organisations. In September 2020, Amnesty International was forced to halt operations in India after a succession of raids by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate. Amnesty had been sharply critical of human rights abuses in the wake of the Modi government&amp;rsquo;s 2019 decision to rescind the constitutional recognition of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and again of the government&amp;rsquo;s use of repressive new laws, whether in Kashmir or elsewhere in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Bureau and the Directorate don&amp;rsquo;t sound Orwellian enough, there is also the National Investigation Agency, which handles cases of sedition and terrorism. Anti-terror laws and charges of sedition are a variation on the tax raid, freely used to silence critics. Sedition cases have shown a 28 per cent increase each year since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. At the start of its second term in 2019, the government also sharpened an already harsh law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The amended law permits the government to designate an individual as a terrorist before proving the charge in court. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bail is virtually impossible to obtain under the UAPA, and the government has the right to hold an accused person in custody for up to 180 days without presenting a charge sheet against them. The Bureau and the Agency handle cases under this law; both sedition and UAPA charges have been levelled at journalists on a regular basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October 2020, while covering the story of a caste atrocity &amp;ndash; the gang rape and torture of a young Dalit woman that had led to her death &amp;ndash; the journalist Siddique Kappan was arrested and charged with being a terrorist. More than a year later, he remains in prison awaiting trial. Once again, the rate of conviction is low, at less than 2 per cent of the 7,840 arrests made between 2015 and 2019. The rate of pendency (cases waiting to reach trial) stands at 83 per cent &amp;ndash; the harrassment being the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Modi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unofficial Emergency&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opposition leaders and the commentariat often compare what is unfolding today to Indira Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s suspension of democracy in 1975, terming it Modi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unofficial Emergency&amp;rdquo;. Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s 21-month-long dictatorship had entailed the suspension of fundamental rights, imprisonment of opposition leaders and pervasive press censorship. Modi&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Emergency&amp;rdquo; is more insidious. Rather than a straightforward authoritarian regime with a single author, it is built upon interlocking circles of collusion, an elite consensus that amplifies the government&amp;rsquo;s message and supports its disruptive behaviour. India&amp;rsquo;s mass media is no simple victim but part of this convergence of interests, and it is complicit in the gutting of democratic citizenship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, India&amp;rsquo;s media landscape in print and broadcasting looks diverse: in 2018, there were over 118,239 publications, along with more than 380 news and current affairs channels on television. This appearance is deceptive: just a few media houses dominate the market. Their business models tend to rely on earnings from advertising, which makes editorial and journalistic freedom vulnerable to &amp;ldquo;soft pressure&amp;rdquo; from both government and corporations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modi has set a record by becoming the first Indian prime minister to complete a full term in office without calling a single press conference. He did, however, spend twice as much on advertising in his first five years as the previous government did in ten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the Economist Intelligence Unit&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Democracy Index&amp;rdquo; charts a steep decline in India&amp;rsquo;s position. In 2014, it was ranked at 27 out of 167 countries; by 2020, it stood at 53, and was reclassified as a &amp;ldquo;flawed democracy&amp;rdquo;. International surveys echo this finding. This year&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Democracy Report&amp;rdquo;, published by the V-Dem Institute in Sweden, describes India&amp;rsquo;s lapse from an &amp;ldquo;electoral democracy&amp;rdquo; in 2010 to an &amp;ldquo;electoral autocracy&amp;rdquo; in 2020. The grim proof of these assessments is the derisive manner in which they are reported on &amp;ndash; or, frequently enough, not reported &amp;ndash; in India&amp;rsquo;s newsrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palagummi Sainath, founder of the People&amp;rsquo;s Archive of Rural India, points out that the Indian media systematically overlooks 70 per cent of the country&amp;rsquo;s population. Coverage of rural issues makes up 0.67 per cent of front-page news in the national dailies, while crime and entertainment dominate the middle pages. Can it even be called &amp;ldquo;mainstream media&amp;rdquo;, he asks, if it studiously ignores the mainstream? And can its coverage of farmers&amp;rsquo; protests be fair when the billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who gains from new laws that bring agriculture under corporate control, also happens to be India&amp;rsquo;s biggest media owner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite lack of resources, small and independent digital platforms increasingly do the heavy lifting in terms of both news coverage and breaking stories. &lt;em&gt;NewsClick&lt;/em&gt;, set up in a shabby one-room studio 12 years ago, saw viewership rise dramatically with its coverage of the farmers&amp;rsquo; protest movement that began in 2020. Erupting with renewed vigour in early February this year, the farmers had the Modi government on the back foot when the Enforcement Directorate came calling on &lt;em&gt;NewsClick&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Inequality in India&amp;rsquo;s media houses&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inequality is entrenched in India&amp;rsquo;s media houses. Oxfam India and the digital platform &lt;em&gt;Newslaundry &lt;/em&gt;helped to expose this reality with their 2019 study &amp;ldquo;Who Tells Our Stories Matters&amp;rdquo;, which examined the representation of different groups in the media, including the indigenous Adivasis or Scheduled Tribes, and the Dalit communities (Scheduled Castes). Dalits make up 16.6 per cent of the national population, and continue to face widespread discrimination and violence, despite untouchability being outlawed. The study examined a selection of print, television and digital platforms in English and Hindi, finding that the Scheduled Tribes, who make up 8.6 per cent of the national population, were virtually absent from newsrooms. In prominent dailies such as the &lt;em&gt;Times of India&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Economic Times&lt;/em&gt;, all the writers on caste issues turned out to be members of the upper castes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India&amp;rsquo;s media is not an outlier here. Social exclusion is rampant in corporate boardrooms, the judiciary, bureaucracy, research and teaching positions in universities, and notably in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) &amp;ndash; the mothership of Hindu nationalist ideology. A secretive and profoundly undemocratic organisation that reaches into every sphere of public life, the RSS has been led through the 96 years of its existence by six unelected men in succession, five of them from India&amp;rsquo;s highest caste, the Brahmins (the remaining one was a Kshatriya, the second-highest caste). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Away from traditional media institutions, however, excluded social groups have a vibrant presence in the digital and social media space. Among their demands is an all-India caste census (the last one was published in 1931). A new caste census, the journalist and public intellectual Dilip Mandal points out, would disclose each caste group&amp;rsquo;s share in the national population, and in wealth, income, savings, credit, higher education and employment. This is precisely the kind of information suppressed by the elite consensus, whether between government and capital or that of upper-caste cohesion, for it would expose Hindutva to some painful truths. The last thing they want is for caste to be acknowledged as a dividing line within the Hindu social order, between entitlement and deprivation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past three years, the prison population of underprivileged Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims has been joined by some of the country&amp;rsquo;s most distinguished anti-caste scholars, lawyers, journalists and rights activists, all of them charged with terrorism under the UAPA. Self-assertion, whether by subordinate caste groups seeking their rightful share of resources, or by the anti-caste movement &amp;ndash; which identifies Hinduism as the basis of caste &amp;ndash; is a grave threat to the RSS&amp;rsquo;s projection of a homogeneous and conservative Hindu nationhood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The force of Hindutva&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Promoting Islamophobia offers an escape route from the subject of caste and has proved useful for Modi in broadening Hindutva&amp;rsquo;s base. &amp;ldquo;Modi hai tau mumkin hai&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Modi makes it possible&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; was the insinuating slogan that returned the BJP government for a second term in 2019. The party&amp;rsquo;s increased vote share and parliamentary majority were swiftly parlayed into a mandate to reshape the constitution. On 3 August that year, the amended UAPA overturned the presumption of innocence as a legal principle in terror-related cases. Two days later, the central government revoked Article 370 &amp;ndash; which had granted the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir special recognition &amp;ndash; and also trifurcated the state. Led by a raucous media, public opinion across the country cheered the dissolution of Kashmir&amp;rsquo;s constitutional status. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of 2019, the central government had passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which obstructs Muslim immigrants from obtaining Indian citizenship. Amit Shah, the minister of home affairs, promised to launch a National Register of Citizens next. The poorly documented among India&amp;rsquo;s Muslims, citizens included, saw themselves at imminent risk of being derecognised and interned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To supporters of Hindutva in the mass media, these were powerful moves. Primetime shows fanned the hatred, accusing Muslims of bizarre, wholly imaginary crimes, from waging &amp;ldquo;love jihad&amp;rdquo; (marrying Hindu women) to &amp;ldquo;UPSC jihad&amp;rdquo; (seeking jobs in the civil services), and even &amp;ldquo;corona jihad&amp;rdquo; (deliberately infecting Hindus). With this free pass for Islamophobia came a fresh contempt for facts and reasoning. This disdain was also extended to defenders of secular values: cued by BJP leaders, television studios denounced human rights activists as the &amp;ldquo;bits-and-pieces gang&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;anti-national&amp;rdquo; subversives, and as &amp;ldquo;urban Naxals&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; secret agents fomenting a communist insurrection. When a group of writers returned their state awards in protest at the government&amp;rsquo;s inaction against violence by lynch mobs attacking Dalits, Muslims and other minorities, they too were deemed &amp;ldquo;anti-national&amp;rdquo;. In these ways, the mass media has helped transform Modi&amp;rsquo;s electoral victory into an epistemic coup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Githa&amp;rsquo;s latest novel, &lt;em&gt;I Have Become the Tide&lt;/em&gt;, shows an India where old forms of bigotry continue to defeat struggles for public reason, inclusion and dignity. However, the novel ends by marking a fresh start, as a great swell of people advances to confront a decaying culture. The ending is not a poetic consolation. Githa also put together a companion volume of non-fiction, &lt;em&gt;Battling for India&lt;/em&gt;, that collates accounts of political resistance and ground-level organisation &amp;ndash; by women, Dalits, Adivasis, writers, artists, religious, ethnic and sexual minorities &amp;ndash; rallying against Hindutva and the neoliberal oligarchy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be Birnam Wood and the troops advancing on Macbeth, not yet, but this force has the courage of its convictions. India&amp;rsquo;s mass media, dwindling and demoralised, ignores this swell of resistance at its peril.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>

This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
