My wife has set up multiple bird feeders, and she also sows seeds on the snow, so all day long it’s flocks of birds flitting past my office window.

<p>You might ask, “why not close your window shades?”. I answer that it doesn’t help, because these birds are flighty and numerous. They swoop in, peck as a mob at the seeds, and then after 10 or 15 seconds, they abruptly rise with a whooshing whirr that is quite loud and audible in my office, indoors.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a hawk that occasionally darts in for a snack and sends everyone in frantic flight, and I’d like to catch it in the act.</p>

<p class="lead">Ken Ham is very concerned about sin, and cartoon ducks, and the curse of homosexuality — more than he is concerned about the pandemic, apparently. <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/04/21/christian-sin-coronavirus-pinknews-genesis-ken-ham-ducktales-death-answers-genesis/">Pink News wrote about his fury over gay ducks appearing in the cartoon <i>Duck Tales</i></a>, prompting him to condemn gay reporters for not being more concerned about sin than COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a new Facebook post, Ham said: “A gay news source wrote an article about me with this headline: ‘Thousands of people are dying from coronavirus every day, but this Christian fundamentalist is raging over two gay cartoon ducks.’”</p>
<p>He suggested that he would have preferred the headline to be “150,000 people die each day in the world, and Ken Ham is concerned for their spiritual state and their eternity because of the raging pandemic of sin”, but added, while knowing nothing about the journalist’s religious beliefs, that they would not understand because “God of this world has blinded the eyes of those who don’t believe”. </p>
<p>He then, bizarrely, went on to speculate about the journalist’s death and whether they even cared about people dying from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ken Ham wrote: <q>Yes, the worst pandemic of all – sin – is raging about us and the death toll is 100 per cent. I predict the writer of the article about me will one day die.</q></p>
<p><q>From a perspective of a non-Christian, why do they care if people die?… If you die and that’s it and you won’t know you ever existed, why do they care about people dying?</q></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s true: Ken Ham doesn’t care much about the pandemic. From Dan Phelps: “From early in the pandemic the Ark Encounter amusement park only “suggested” the use of masks and complained bitterly about closures and Kentucky mask mandates. YouTube videos by Ark visitors indicate mask wearing is practiced by a small fraction of visitors.” So yes, he is not at all inconsistent here — he really does believe that sin is a greater worry than dying of COVID-19. He has even <a href="">claimed that viruses are a good thing for humanity</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Evolution, on the other hand, says that death has always been a part of nature. This view, found nowhere in the Bible, was actually embraced in a recent article by the editor-in-chief of Christianity Today. His belief in evolution led him to declare that it is a biological reality that “bacteria and viruses are not bitter fruits of the fall, but among the first fruits of good creation itself.” But this idea makes God the author of bad things.</p>
<p>Even in a fallen world, God remains omnipotent and perfectly capable of sustaining and protecting His fallen creation. But when Adam sinned, the world was cursed. Suffering and death entered into His creation. The whole universe now suffers from the effects of sin.</p>
<p>In the biblical worldview, viruses had an originally good purpose in creation. In fact, many viruses today are being investigated for their positive benefits, including possible symbiotic relationships and the regulating of populations of bacteria in our gut. Viruses are also used for gene therapy. Such modern-day research offers us a glimpse into the original created purpose for viruses.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/menton-116x150.jpeg" alt="" width="116" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-64934" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/menton-116x150.jpeg 116w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/menton-233x300.jpeg 233w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/menton.jpeg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px"/></p>
<p>Cool cool cool. So what sin was David Menton guilty of, and what virtue has he acquired?</p>
<p>If you don’t recall, David Menton was one of Ken Ham’s pseudoscientific minions — <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/?s=menton">I’ve mentioned him a few times</a>. He’s a guy who got a Ph.D. in biology, and used it to lie for Jesus. Ken Ham has now <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/ministry-news/core-ministry/fond-farewell-david-menton/">announced that David Menton died “after a brief illness”</a>. He doesn’t say what that illness was, but the <a href="https://obituaries.mankatofreepress.com/obituary/david-menton-1084014808">newspaper obituary does</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. David Norman Menton, 83, of Petersburg, KY passed away <strong>from Covid</strong> Saturday, December 11, 2021 in Edgewood, KY. </p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. Maybe if Ham had been a bit more diligent and rational in policing all those people strolling around his “museum” and Ark Park, his <q>great friend</q> would still be alive today.</p>

<p class="lead">All the final exams have been turned in, so now it’s time to sit my butt down and read them all. I’ve got two classes with about 25 students each, so here’s what I am to complete this weekend. These were all due on Friday, yesterday.</p>
<p><b>Comprehensive Final Exam for Fundamentals of Genetics, Evolution, and Development</b>. This is the monster, 7 pages of questions in different formats that cover the topics in the title of the course and also a bit of the history and philosophy of science. FunGenEvoDevo is a first year overview course that doesn’t dig too deeply, but prepares them with the general background (there is also another intro course, Evolution of Biodiversity, that hits them with evolution again and also basics of ecology and systematics). I started on this one yesterday, and am a bit more than halfway through; I plan to finish it by this afternoon.</p>
<p><b>Lab Final for Cell Biology</b>. Another longish exam, this one emphasizes basic quantitative skills they should have learned in the lab. So lots of questions about unit conversions, calculating concentrations, interpreting data, etc. For instance, they get some measurements of reaction rates, and they then have to calculate enzymatic K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>. There are a lot of parts to this one, too, but most of the answers are short, specific, and numeric, which are relatively easy to grade.</p>
<p><b>Required Final Essay for Cell Biology</b>. Oh boy, this will be challenging. I gave them a paper to read (“How energy flow shapes cell evolution” by Nick Lane) and asked them to summarize it and relate it all to the content of the course. On this one, I demand high writing standards and coherence in addressing the subject, so we’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p><b>Optional Final Exam for Cell Biology</b>. Another big ol’ comprehensive exam, but this one is optional for the students: whatever score they get on the final will replace their lowest midterm score. Everyone has a bad day, so this is their opportunity to vindicate themselves. It’s a long exam, but grading it might not be too bad — only about a third of the class has opted to do it.</p>
<p>So that’s my weekend! This is all I’m doing for a few days. I hope to get it all done by Sunday evening and get all those grades submitted to the registrar early.</p>
<p>Then on Monday I have one more class to grade, Biological Communications II, in which students spend the semester writing a 10+ page review paper under my tutelage, so I already have a good idea of what they’ve done — I just have to go over what is supposed to be the final polished draft of the paper. And then I’m ALL DONE!</p>
<p>I guess I better buckle down and get to work <em>now</em>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>10:45 Saturday: FunGenEvoDevo done! Grades submitted! Students mostly did OK, but a few of them may have learned that skipping an exam or two is a good way to fail a course.</p>
<hr/>
<p>3:45 Saturday: Lab final done! Starting on the required final essay.</p>
<hr/>
<p>1pm Sunday: Required lab final done! Now to polish off the optional final.</p>

<p class="lead">John Cleese wishes to register a complaint (see? It must be an old Monty Python routine). He is complaining to the BBC that, in a recent interview, he came off sounding <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59681167">“old-fashioned, uncaring and basically harmful”</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, the BBC was dead-on accurate. Given the <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/atg/2017/04/25/parents-perspective-on-bbcs-transgender-kids-who-knows-best/">BBC’s</a> <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/intransitive/2021/11/04/there-are-bigger-terfish-to-fry-the-bbc-should-be-ashamed-but-theyre-not/">recent</a> <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/oceanoxia/2021/11/12/bigotry-transphobia-and-the-bbc-they-always-tell-on-themselves/">record</a> on these matters, that is surprising.</p>
<p>Cleese’s comedic routine is rather rusty, though, since he stomped out in a huff at being asked questions on subjects he’s been shouting about lately, like cancel culture and trans rights. He only wants to talk about those things when he’s the only voice, and the interviewer is only a stenographer.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cleese then removed his headphones, as it was “not the interview I had agreed to,” he noted.</p>
<p>“Karishma had no interest in a discussion with me. She wanted only the role of prosecutor. The BBC needs to train her again.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He had only “agreed to” a fluff piece, I guess. Oh, for the days when media interviews were challenging and interesting and put people on the spot…</p>

    <title>The curious mind of a dog</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5899/the-curious-mind-of-a-dog#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2021-12-16-at-10.47.26.jpg" height="862" alt="Screenshot-2021-12-16-at-10.47.26" width="1393" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as Christina and Jake Hunger brought their new puppy home, they were utterly smitten. Stella was a tiny eight-week-old Catahoula-Blue Heeler cross, with rich, chocolate-coloured fur, bat ears and a white bib. Stella was a highly engaging little dog, almost frantic with delight every time they entered the room, wagging her tail so hard it set her whole body a-wiggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puppies are hard work. There was toilet training, nap times, playtime and lead training. At night, Stella often whimpered until Jake went downstairs to sleep by her bed. But Stella was a quick learner too. Some commands, like &amp;ldquo;Come&amp;rdquo;, were easy. They just bent down and patted their knees and Stella would dash right over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina, who works as a speech-language pathologist, was struck by just how precocious her pet was. Sure, Stella was a puppy, but she was also displaying many of the pre-linguistic skills Christina looked for in her nonverbal clients: she maintained eye contact, whined for attention, dropped toys by their feet when she wanted to play, and used gestures to make requests, like pawing at her empty water bowl. Christina started noting down these milestones as she noticed them: already, at two months, Stella was exhibiting over half of the skills a nine-month-old baby might be expected to demonstrate shortly before they begin to say their first words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same. Christina knew that. Stella wouldn&amp;rsquo;t keep passing milestones that would, within months, bring her miraculously into the realm of the verbal the way most infant humans are. Still, it was enough to give her pause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her job, Christina works with children with developmental issues, finding ways in which they might communicate their wants through non-normative means. This field, known as &amp;ldquo;augmented and alternative communication&amp;rdquo;, or AAC, encompasses many tools and techniques, including sign language and facial expressions, as well as speech-generating devices of the kind used by Stephen Hawking. In AAC, there is no &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to communicate, no end goal for clients to aim towards; success is successful communication of intent between two parties, however that&amp;rsquo;s achieved. Often she uses iPad apps, allowing her clients to press buttons that enunciate words or phrases on their behalf &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;More&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Stop&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hungry&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;All done&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Human devices for canine friends&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What she likes most about her job is that her clients often surprise both her and their parents with their hidden abilities. Suddenly, children who had seemed oblivious to much of what was going on around them would seize their device and communicate in unexpected bursts, stringing together words they had never before used or even seemed to understand. Sometimes children who seemed to have plateaued would make huge advances once their device was reprogrammed to offer a better range of vocabulary. In this way, Christina had learned never to underestimate how closely someone else might be listening, even if they seemed inattentive or used unusual body language, their verbal speech non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina wondered whether Stella could learn to communicate using similar tools. Could a dog use AAC? She didn&amp;rsquo;t see why not. One evening she found a pack of four &amp;ldquo;recordable answer buzzers&amp;rdquo; online &amp;ndash; easy-press buttons intended for use during parlour games, but perfect for Stella. They were palm-sized and easily compressible by a paw or a muzzle. When triggered, each button would sound a short audio clip. Christina programmed the first button to announce &amp;ldquo;Outside&amp;rdquo;. It would be Stella&amp;rsquo;s first word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while for the penny to drop, but after three weeks of Christina and Jake pressing the button with their toe and enunciating the word before opening the door, Stella began to pay it a great deal of attention. Sometimes she would bark at the button, as if willing it to activate itself, or tensely sit by it, waiting for them to press it. Christina recognised this behaviour from the children at work: sometimes a child on the cusp of understanding would take her finger in theirs and use it to press the button on their behalf. It was a good sign: this usually happened very shortly before the child first used the device for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, a few nights later, Jake woke Christina. It had happened. They rushed downstairs. Stella did it again. Outside. Outside. She seemed delighted with herself, and when they opened the door in response she ran in ecstatic loops around the garden. Jake and Christina were elated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that first button push, Stella has gone on to learn around 50 words: nouns, verbs, adjectives. Christina introduced them slowly and thoughtfully, based largely on her own intuition and her experience of working with children. She also tried to offer Stella what speech-language pathologists call &amp;ldquo;core words&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that is, the words she would use most often. Then, as with the &amp;ldquo;Outside&amp;rdquo; button, she and Jake would faithfully model the new words every time a suitable situation arose. They&amp;rsquo;d press &amp;ldquo;Water&amp;rdquo; right before they refilled her bowl. Or &amp;ldquo;Play&amp;rdquo; before, during and after a game with a toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella&amp;rsquo;s favourites, of course, were &amp;ldquo;Walk&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Beach&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Park&amp;rdquo;. But she also had &amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Love you&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Bye&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Bed&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Cat&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Eat&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Play&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Want&amp;rdquo;. Stella was curious and would press buttons to see what happened next. Christina and Jake would enact what the button suggested, and after dozens or hundreds of reinforcements, Stella learned what to expect. Christina wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure that Stella understood the words to mean exactly what we use them to mean, but the connotations were similar. &amp;ldquo;Love you&amp;rdquo; became associated with cuddles, soft voices, sympathetic attention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina was working purely to satisfy her own curiosity. But Stella&amp;rsquo;s progress was quick and caught her by surprise. In early interactions, button usage orbited around requests: &amp;ldquo;Outside&amp;rdquo; to go to the toilet, &amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo; to request assistance with a lost toy. As time went on, Stella began to use the buttons in interesting ways. While watching Christina watering houseplants, she pressed &amp;ldquo;Water&amp;rdquo;; when emotionally charged, she tapped buttons repeatedly. She then began to combine words. &amp;ldquo;Eat no&amp;rdquo; one evening when they got home past her usual dinner time. Later on, &amp;ldquo;Come outside&amp;rdquo;. Further down the line, &amp;ldquo;Stella want play&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The limits of a dog&amp;rsquo;s comprehension&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christina isn&amp;rsquo;t the first person to explore the limits of a pet dog&amp;rsquo;s language comprehension. Behavioural psychologist Dr John Pilley once taught the collie Chaser the names of 1,000 toys, and later demonstrated that she understood basic grammar. But Christina&amp;rsquo;s AAC board meant she could study not only Stella&amp;rsquo;s comprehension but her capacity for generating language, for two-way communication. The experiment has been successful far beyond what she ever imagined. Throughout, she has documented Stella&amp;rsquo;s progress online, via her popular Instagram account, @hunger4words, where she has amassed close to 800,000 followers, many of them pet owners keen to try Christina&amp;rsquo;s methods for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among them is Alexis Devine, an artist based in Tacoma, Washington, who in 2019 bought a bouncy, bed-headed Sheepadoodle (an Old English Sheepdog crossed with a Poodle) called Bunny. She used an AAC system and also began with a simple &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; button by the front door. Alexis copied Christina&amp;rsquo;s methods. Over a six-month period she modelled new button usage before combining them into a large wooden &amp;ldquo;keyboard&amp;rdquo; on the floor. Soon she was contacted by Leo Trottier, a cognitive scientist and computer programmer who offered her the use of a prototype canine AAC device, which grouped buttons by type &amp;ndash; activities, objects, places, descriptions &amp;ndash; in a modification of the Fitzgerald Key, a system developed in the early 20th century to help deaf children structure sentences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, Bunny&amp;rsquo;s progress has been even faster than Stella&amp;rsquo;s. Videos posted by Alexis, who has seven million followers on TikTok (@whataboutbunny), show more than 90 buttons arranged on neat hexagonal tiles. In one viral clip, Bunny looks in the mirror and appears to experience an existential crisis. &amp;ldquo;Who this?&amp;rdquo; she asks. &amp;ldquo;Bunny&amp;rdquo;, Alexis replies. Bunny then walks away and stares through the window before returning to press &amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amusing as the videos are, the researchers need harder data to work from. The history of cross-species communication study has been plagued with controversy. In one famous early example, a horse called Clever Hans appeared to perform calculations on request, tapping his hoof on the ground to answer questions like, &amp;ldquo;What is three plus four?&amp;rdquo; Hans would perform when asked both by his owner and by strangers, but it became apparent that he was responding not to the rules of mathematics, but to his questioners&amp;rsquo; body language: when he reached the right answer, they would relax, and he would know to stop tapping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The science of talking animals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clever Hans&amp;rsquo; owner was not a fraudster &amp;ndash; he was utterly convinced of his horse&amp;rsquo;s genius &amp;ndash; and Hans also took in a number of contemporary scientists. What the case demonstrates is just how difficult it can be to disentangle animal comprehension from their responses to subtle cues. &amp;ldquo;The issues of overinterpretation (ie the human interprets the animal signals as more meaningful than they actually are) and cueing (the animal reproducing sequences acquired through extensive learning or simply responding to cues by the human rather than flexibly producing communicative sequences) have long been discussed as some of the main issues of several other animal language studies,&amp;rdquo; explains Federico Rossano, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, San Diego. He has been studying Bunny&amp;rsquo;s progress as part of the &amp;ldquo;They Can Talk&amp;rdquo; research project, which aims to apply &amp;ldquo;a rigorous scientific approach to determine whether, and if so, how and how much non-humans are able to express themselves in language-like ways.&amp;rdquo; Bunny is only one of 3,000 pets taking part in &amp;ldquo;They Can Talk&amp;rdquo;, in which Rossano, Trottier and others have been analysing the dogs&amp;rsquo; keypad logs and the context in which the buttons are used. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key requirement for them to be classed as language users, in Rossano&amp;rsquo;s opinion, is that the dogs must be able to combine and recombine the various words in different contexts &amp;ndash; that is, not simply asking &amp;ldquo;Where dad?&amp;rdquo;, as Bunny has done when Alexis&amp;rsquo; partner goes to work, but also asking &amp;ldquo;Where mum?&amp;rdquo; when Alexis leaves, and so on. &amp;ldquo;If she repeats or slightly modifies sequences when she does not get a response and clearly orients towards the human while producing the button presses, it would appear more likely that she is trying to communicate something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rossano and his team have installed five cameras in Alexis&amp;rsquo; house to allow a constant livestream to be beamed to Rossano&amp;rsquo;s lab. &amp;ldquo;Having the cameras on Bunny&amp;rsquo;s board takes some of the pressure off of me feeling like I have to personally record everything,&amp;rdquo; explains Alexis. It also removes any suspicion that she might be selectively editing their interactions. So far, Rossano says, the data is quite convincing. The &amp;ldquo;They Can Talk&amp;rdquo; team is preparing to present their findings to the scientific community. It&amp;rsquo;s important, he says, to &amp;ldquo;retain a healthy scientific scepticism&amp;rdquo;. Nevertheless, &amp;ldquo;the evidence points pretty clearly towards them [the pets in the study] communicating with the humans while using these devices&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexis too is keen to underline that she does not know exactly how much Bunny understands of their interaction. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been open about the importance of scepticism, and the difficulty of avoiding implicit bias from the beginning, and thankfully I personally am not tasked with proving or disproving anything. Our journey is about curiosity, connection and exploring the depths of communication with a non-human animal, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s pretty important regardless of the eventual scientific findings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shaping a dog's mind and body&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dog owners are not unbiased parties when it comes to assessing their own pet&amp;rsquo;s mental abilities. This much is obvious. I&amp;rsquo;m a dog owner, and I can tell you this for free. When dog owners speak to one another, we often expound at length upon our pets&amp;rsquo; habits and personalities, their likes and dislikes, even their opinions or dreams. Some of these impressions may well be true. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible, even likely, that we are wrong more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;We project a great deal onto our wordless companions, and pride ourselves in playing a protective, even parental, role in their lives. They offer us clues as to their feelings, moods and wants, but we can never truly know what they are thinking. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s for the best: &amp;ldquo;no small amount of dogs&amp;rsquo; winsomeness is the empathy that we can attribute to them as they silently contemplate us,&amp;rdquo; wrote the cognitive scientist Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, in &lt;em&gt;Inside of a Dog&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the relationship between dog and human is unusually close thanks to an estimated 11,000 years of domestication. We feed them, care for them and breed them selectively for friendliness and other useful traits. We have shaped almost every attribute of their bodies and minds. They live in our homes and play important roles in many industries. In various ways, dogs have shaped us too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any animal was likely to excel at communication with humans, it would be the dog. Yet until now, there has been surprisingly little study of them. Past animal communication researchers have instead opted for gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and even dolphins. But monkeys and apes, for all their human-like characteristics, are notoriously erratic, even aggressive. Dolphins, being water-based, bring myriad logistical problems. Dogs, meanwhile, are domestic companions, unusually easy to train, responsive to human commands and body language, and are often &amp;ndash; but not invariably &amp;ndash; keen to please. For these reasons, the Soviet space programme, unlike Nasa&amp;rsquo;s, opted to use dogs in early rocket launches after circus trainers warned them that monkeys were too temperamental to be useful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their attentiveness and intelligence is part of what makes dogs so appealing, but our love for them is also part of the reason why it&amp;rsquo;s so difficult to lay aside scepticism. &amp;ldquo;It is not the animals who desire to speak and cannot, I suspect; it is that we desire them to talk and cannot effect it,&amp;rdquo; writes Horowitz. In past interviews, Horowitz has called for research to focus on dogs&amp;rsquo; natural modes of communication and behaviour, rather on their capacity to learn or respond to ours. Nevertheless, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult not to get excited by Bunny and Stella&amp;rsquo;s conversational prowess, and the small glimmers they offer us as to how canine minds might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may never know if the dogs are using and comprehending human language to mean exactly the same as we do. But if nothing else, it gives us a great deal of insight into our relationship with them as a species, their concerns and their personalities. As for my own dog, I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet tried to teach her to speak. I very much want to learn her innermost desires, but I suspect she has little interest in communicating with me on my own terms. If she did, I imagine it might closely resemble the one-track conversation of scrappy Bastian, a rescued terrier in New York City (@bastianandbrews), who will scratch the relevant buttons repeatedly until their covers fly off. &amp;ldquo;Hungry hungry hungry hungry,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;food food food food treat treat treat treat food food food.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, who can blame him? I think I can relate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>In the US, 'civil religion' ensures church and state remain tied at the hip</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5904/in-the-us-civil-religion-ensures-church-and-state-remain-tied-at-the-hip#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="US coins were inscribed with 'In God We Trust' following the US Civil War (image taken from QuoteInspector.com)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/money-qi57-md.jpg" height="480" alt="money-qi57-md" width="720" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The First Amendment to the US Constitution prevents the government from making laws designed to regulate the establishment of any religion, or that would prohibit the free exercise of religion. Yet the US remains a decidedly "Christian" nation. Nearly all US Presidents have &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/20/biden-only-second-catholic-president-but-nearly-all-have-been-christians-2/"&gt;professed&lt;/a&gt; to follow some form of the Christian faith. Only Presidents Lincoln and Jefferson have claimed no religious affiliation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historically, the sitting president's personal faith has been reflected in the overall populace. The Public Religion Research Institute &lt;a href="https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that 70 per cent of Americans identify as Christian, and 5 per cent identify with non-Christian religions. Nearly a quarter are religiously unaffiliated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the preponderance of US citizens who claim to be Christians, how is this ideal of the separation of church and state enacted within the public square? Rob Boston, Director of Communications at &lt;a href="https://www.au.org/"&gt;Americans United&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan educational and advocacy organization dedicated to advancing the separation of religion and government, explains that while the United States operates under the separation of church and state, &amp;ldquo;there has always been something of a carve out for what scholars call &amp;lsquo;civil religion&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; that is, the tendency of government and political leaders to use religion (usually in a generic sense) to buttress perceived national goals.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the most explicit recent example of this came during the Trump administration. Throughout his time in office, Trump &lt;a href="https://thehumanist.com/commentary/let-us-say-its-time-to-end-the-national-prayer-breakfast"&gt;displayed&lt;/a&gt; a politicised version of Christianity that contained a toxic mixture of conservative white evangelicalism, prosperity gospel preaching, and Christian nationalism. His policies were not reflective of the will of the majority of Americans but instead tended to reflect his Christian nationalist policy goals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon initial glance, the Biden administration may present itself as less outwardly "religious" than Trump&amp;rsquo;s. For instance, as &lt;a href="https://religiondispatches.org/2021-national-prayer-breakfast-a-kinder-gentler-form-of-christian-capitalism/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; at Religion Dispatches, during the 2021 National Prayer Breakfast, President Joe Biden offered a bipartisan message of national unity and faith in light of the January 6 Capitol insurrection, with even Fox News &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-addresses-national-prayer-breakfast"&gt;highlighting&lt;/a&gt; Biden&amp;rsquo;s call to end &amp;ldquo;political extremism.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Biden&amp;rsquo;s endorsement by progressive faith leaders, as well as events like the virtual &lt;a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2020/09/04/biden-campaign-launches-catholic-voter-outreach-initiative"&gt;Catholics for Biden&lt;/a&gt; voter outreach campaign and the rise of organizations like Evangelicals for Biden and The New Moral Majority point to the continued infusion of faith and politics within the US administration. It may manifest in a somewhat kinder, gentler expression, yet the ongoing problematic practice of &amp;ldquo;civil religion", in which an administration&amp;rsquo;s national policy agenda is influenced by its religious orientation, remains in place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Politicians, prayer and "God talk"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For decades, American civil religion has been seen most visibly through the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual gathering of US politicians, pastors and industry leaders. Despite the fact that it is sponsored by a secretive private Christian group titled The Family (aka The Fellowship Foundation), invitations are issued on congressional letterhead and the press secure their access via the White House. Ever since President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered the inaugural address in 1953, every US president has addressed this gathering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Eisenhower era from 1953 to 1961, Christianity became identified as the country's overall civil religion. &amp;ldquo;Under God&amp;rdquo; became part of the Pledge of Allegiance, and &amp;ldquo;In God We Trust&amp;rdquo; was added to the US paper currency (and to US coins after the Civil War). Politicians regularly employ &amp;ldquo;God talk&amp;rdquo; in speeches, call on Americans to pray during times of crisis or uncertainty, and offer prayers before meetings of local, state, and federal governments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Supreme Court of the United States has issued rulings in favour of church and state separation, including &lt;a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale"&gt;banning prayer in public schools&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/37/bob-jones-university-v-united-states"&gt;permitting&lt;/a&gt; the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to deny tax-exempt status to institutions whose policies are &amp;ldquo;contrary to established public policy,&amp;rdquo; even if those policies are based on religious beliefs. However, as Rob Boston has noted, US Courts have also ruled that certain forms of &amp;ldquo;civil religion" are legal. This can be seen in court rulings granting individuals exemptions based on religious beliefs to, for example, the government-mandated Covid-19 &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/courts-clash-over-religious-exemptions-for-vaccine-mandates"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. "Given the current conservative cast of the Supreme Court, that is not likely to change anytime soon," Boston says. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian pastors and leading faith-based institutions can, according to Boston, endorse candidates for public office in their private capacities. However, they are not legally allowed to use the resources of their houses of worship or faith-based nonprofit to support or oppose a political candidate, nor are they permitted to issue statements of support or opposition from the pulpit. All the same, the IRS has not, in a number of years, penalised those churches who use their pulpit for political purposes. The last &lt;a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/senator-grassley-and-the-televangelists/"&gt;attempt&lt;/a&gt; by Congress in 2007 to force ministries to provide greater fiscal accountability failed to garner traction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While political candidates and elected officials can and should hear from faith communities about their concerns and views on social issues, public officials should be careful to include diverse faith and secular voices in discussions on public policy. Boston cites as one example former President Trump's creation of an Evangelical Advisory Board that was not inclusive of the full spectrum of faith and nonreligious communities in America. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite now being out of the presidency, Trump's public support among white evangelicals continues to rise in part due to his ongoing support of faith-based &lt;a href="https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/articles/why-white-evangelicals-stuck-trump"&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; that matter to evangelical leaders, such as abortion and religious freedom. White evangelicals in the pews also remain attracted to Republican positions on the economy, national security, and immigration. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, 77 per cent of this demographic supported Trump in 2016, a number that increased to 84 per cent in 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The rise of the irreligious US voting bloc&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While these debates continue to rage, the religious composition of the US continues to grow more pluralistic. &amp;ldquo;Nones&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; people who profess no religious affiliation - &lt;a href="https://thehumanist.com/commentary/debunking-rise-democratic-christian-voters"&gt;represent&lt;/a&gt; 24 per cent of US voters. As the Pew Research Center has noted, Biden's win can be attributed in part to the fact that more atheists and agnostics voted for him in 2020 than they did Hillary Clinton in 2016. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most politicians remain entrenched in their old patterns, and despite a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/no-religion-largest-group-first-time-usa-trnd/index.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; finding that there are as many nonreligious Americans as there are Catholics or evangelicals, they continue to engage in efforts to reach the faithful in the pews. To date, neither the Democrats or Republicans have launched any significant initiatives to target the growing voting block that professes no religious affiliation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US electorate is changing. It&amp;rsquo;s time the political establishment took note and responded to the will of the people and not their faith-based funding streams.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The art of the blag</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5892/the-art-of-the-blag#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Rowson.jpg" height="608" alt="Illustration by Martin Rowson" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was Janet Dobson who first suggested that I was degree material. I was 23 at the time and working as a linkman outside the Odeon cinema in Leicester Square. Although the job had its perks &amp;ndash; a rather fetching brown and gold uniform and regular tips from cinemagoers who needed help parking their cars &amp;ndash; it was not an occupation that offered great hope of advancement. And, as Janet pointed out, an ability to stand upright outside a building for five hours at a time hardly qualified me for any other position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;You should try for Birkbeck College,&amp;rdquo; urged Janet. &amp;ldquo;They take people without the usual qualifications on their evening degree courses.&amp;rdquo; As I undid the gold buttons of my uniform that night, I did so with a new resolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application form seemed straightforward enough until I reached the final paragraph: &amp;ldquo;State your principal hobbies.&amp;rdquo; What hobbies? Hobbies meant collecting. And had I ever collected anything? Stamps? Not really. Butterflies? No. Early Victorian etchings? Certainly not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about bus tickets? When I was about 11, a classmate, Ken Rogers, told me a secret. Apparently if you collected a bus ticket on which all the numbers added up to 21 &amp;ndash; say 4, 8, 7, 2 &amp;ndash; then you could show this ticket to any girl and she would immediately grant you special favours. In Ken&amp;rsquo;s measured words, &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;ll be up for it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if Ken had been right, I could hardly expect that my Birkbeck invigilators would regard my clumsy numerical attempts to seduce third-form schoolgirls as somehow equivalent to a lifetime collecting butterflies or Commonwealth stamps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither, in all conscience, could I cite my junior school collection of birds&amp;rsquo; eggs. That had now become a hobby that dare not speak its name. For although we had a tacit agreement that we would only take one egg from any of the nests that we raided, it was difficult to evade the charge that our concerted efforts were doing much to further the imminent extinction of the Pied Flycatcher. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did remember one other activity that might just pass muster as a hobby. From the age of nine I&amp;rsquo;d assiduously racked up a complete set of Catholic indulgences. Back then a whole range of devotional activities came with a promise of relief from eternal damnation. So if you regularly attended Holy Mass on the first Friday of nine consecutive months, you were assured by serious theologians that you would evade everlasting Hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, however, this seemed to fall short. It was difficult to imagine a vice-chancellor, or even a registrar, admitting an applicant on the grounds that his hobby would eventually ensure eternal life in the blessed company of saints and archangels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was Janet who came to the rescue. She asked her graduate friends how they had filled in their applications. Yes, they&amp;rsquo;d all been required to state a hobby and many had opted for brass rubbing. There was a good reason. Whereas other hobbies required some basic knowledge &amp;ndash; an ability, say, to translate the foreign words on postage stamps or to know the fine distinction between a Red Admiral and a Clouded Skipper butterfly &amp;ndash; brass rubbing required nothing more than a sheet of tracing paper and the tomb of some long-forgotten saint in the local parish church. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brass rubbing?&amp;rdquo; queried the Birkbeck registrar. I was ready for him. &amp;ldquo;Oh yes,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;You only need a sheet of tracing paper and the tomb of some long-forgotten saint in your local parish church.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Well, Mr Taylor,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;You have not exactly impressed the panel with the news that you wish to study psychology because you are interested in other people. But, on balance, we are happy to offer you a place on the grounds that you should enjoy a great deal of fellowship with your other first-year undergraduates. None of them may have any expertise in the psychological processes of learning, memory or motivation. But to a man and a woman they are all brass rubbers. You never know, perhaps they will let you share their tracing paper!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Q&amp;A: Eimear McBride</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5900/qa-eimear-mcbride#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Eimear McBride (Sophie Bassouls)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Eimar_McBride_&amp;copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall.jpg" height="666" alt="Eimar_McBride_&amp;copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eimear McBride is the author of three novels: &amp;ldquo;A Girl is a Half-formed Thing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Lesser Bohemians&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Strange Hotel&amp;rdquo;. She has received a number of awards, including the Goldsmiths Prize and Irish Novel of the Year. McBride recently published &amp;ldquo;Something Out of Place: Women and Disgust&amp;rdquo;, a polemical essay in book form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Something Out of Place&amp;rdquo; argues that the contradictory forces of disgust and objectification continue to control women in western culture. Does religion play a part in this? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has its roots in Judaeo-Christian attitudes towards women&amp;rsquo;s bodies. There are many cultural prejudices that have come down to us through biblical ideas that we have since disregarded and decided are no longer useful for contemporary living. But this issue has been transmuted and updated over the generations and continues to take different forms. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly serving a purpose for the patriarchal system that still holds power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You call for an end to shame and taboo. What does this mean in practice? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still a struggle for women to find a place where their bodies are accepted and allowed to function [naturally]. Women cannot own the experience of their bodies. It&amp;rsquo;s still a badge of honour for a woman to go into work and nobody to know they are having a terrible period. Women are not expected to have a difficult time when they&amp;rsquo;re going through the menopause. That&amp;rsquo;s something that they are supposed to privately talk about in the kitchen! So accepting the realities of the problem of physical experience and normalising it will help women form a more contented relationship with their bodies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this relate to your writing about the female body in metaphorical terms as &amp;ldquo;meat&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I borrowed this term from Angela Carter&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography&lt;/em&gt; (1978). Men&amp;rsquo;s bodies [in our culture] are not seen as meat, but flesh, almost divine, separate and set apart. But women&amp;rsquo;s bodies go through many more changes throughout their lives. This has then been used as a way to condemn women to the place of the animal. Their bodies are seen as a measurement of their humanity, and the mind that inhabits the body is of no consequence. And so women&amp;rsquo;s bodies are treated like pieces of meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does anything give you hope for the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The progress made in Ireland in recent years has given me hope, like the changes to the abortion law there. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would ever see that in my own lifetime. Also, the #MeToo movement made a lot of noise, but I worry that the momentum for real legal change slowed down in the years after that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You seem to be concerned about the rise of social media and online culture. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The arrival of the internet seemed like it was going to open a platform for discussion, but it has instead closed and compartmentalised it. The problem with cancel culture is that it does not look for places to overlap. It&amp;rsquo;s creating a very poisoned public space where people are unable to find their places of connection. It was possible before to argue with people, and that was useful for trying to discover what it was that you believe yourself. It meant you could be open to ideas that you may not have previously even considered. Now people are put into a box, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t agree with every single thing that person does, they&amp;rsquo;re trash. That is a mistake that is going to take a long time to undo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pornography is another concern of yours. How can this be addressed? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regulation is one aspect. But there should be a huge amount of education too, especially with teenagers: it really isn&amp;rsquo;t representative of actual adult sexual relationships. There are so many things in porn that are just untruthful. People want to look at other people having sex. That has always been the case. But also, how do you create a situation where people who perform are not being exploited?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your novels are celebrated for the way they play with language and make use of ambiguity. What attracts you to this style?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a mixture of many things. I was interested in modernism, especially James Joyce and Samuel Beckett. It also felt that there was a type of experience that was very much underrepresented in contemporary fiction, not just for women, but people in general: life that exists underneath rational thought. It&amp;rsquo;s a very powerful force that influences the decisions we make, how we behave and who we are. It seemed to me that modernism was a tool that could be used to explore that idea. We had been told that the future of the novel lay in social realism. But I felt it was worth going back to modernism and to look at those techniques again and to use them in different ways and describe different kinds of experiences. Fiction has been compartmentalised. But it&amp;rsquo;s possible to be a bit more promiscuous. And that&amp;rsquo;s the pleasure and point of fiction: you write it in order to get to a kind of truth that biography, memoir or journalism won&amp;rsquo;t get you to in understanding what it is to be a person. And everything&amp;rsquo;s fair game when you are doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other writers have influenced you? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shakespeare, weird Jacobean tragedies, Thomas Mann, Gertrude Stein. To name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The success of your debut novel, &amp;ldquo;A Girl is a Half-formed Thing&amp;rdquo;, came quite late in your career. Did that long struggle put you off writing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing &lt;em&gt;A Girl is a Half-formed Thing&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t write anything for three years, then I decided to write &lt;em&gt;The Lesser Bohemians&lt;/em&gt;. But at that stage, &lt;em&gt;A Girl is A Half-formed Thing&lt;/em&gt; was still six years away from being published. Clearly, nobody wanted my writing. And I did wonder: is it right to start another book? But the truth was that I knew that there was nothing else I could ever do with my life. I had a kind of dark night of the soul moment. But being a writer and having a writing career are two different things. And even for successful writers that is also true. The career is often very disruptive to the writing. I kept going even though I thought I was writing into a void. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes you want to keep returning to the themes of the female body and the trauma of sexual abuse? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every writer just has the thing that is interesting to them. For me it&amp;rsquo;s been the life of the female body, and what happens to a woman who has experienced sexual violence. But there is a progression [in the books] too. &lt;em&gt;A Girl is A Half-formed Thing&lt;/em&gt; is about situating the reader right in the very moment of the abuse, in that complete sort of inferno of suffering that the girl goes through. But &lt;em&gt;The Lesser Bohemians&lt;/em&gt; is about what it&amp;rsquo;s like to live after that, many years later. It asks questions like: what is it to be a survivor of abuse when you are alone again in the world and there is nobody putting a hand on you that you don&amp;rsquo;t want? Or how do you live in the world with that history, and what do you then become? Then in &lt;em&gt;Strange Hotel&lt;/em&gt; there is an echo of those things in the background. I feel like &lt;em&gt;Strange Hotel&lt;/em&gt; has sort of completed that period for me as a writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will your fiction be going in a different direction now? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel as though each book has its own set of rules and requirements. And with each new book it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m starting again, like I feel like I have to write again from scratch. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I will be interested to write about sexual abuse again, so explicitly. I feel like that might be over now. But then again, it might not be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>"We need to correct the view that refugees are an economic burden"</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="Somali Refugees in Dolo Ado, Ethiopia (UNHCR Ethiopia/ Somali refugees / J. Ose / June 2012)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Dollo-Addo.jpg" height="900" alt="Dollo-Addo" width="1348" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexander Betts is Professor of Forced Migration and International Affairs at the University of Oxford and author of "The Wealth of Refugees: How Displaced People Can Build Economies" (Oxford University Press), which was published in April.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Your book argues that the likelihood of a long-term refugee presence in host countries around the world is only going to grow as the climate crisis deepens and more people are forced to cross borders. What does this mean for how refugees should be viewed in host countries? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We live in an age of displacement. We are going to face rising numbers of refugees but also declining political will to admit asylum seekers. Climate change will exacerbate this trend. But it&amp;rsquo;s worth being aware that most refugees are not in Europe or North America. Eight-five per cent are hosted by low and middle-income countries like Jordan, Uganda, and Colombia, which neighbour conflict and crisis. If refugee protection is to be sustainable then these countries need to view refugees as a benefit rather than simply a burden. In order for that to happen, the rich world has to support these countries, not just by offering humanitarian assistance, but also by providing development assistance. The key is to recognise and build upon the skills, talents, and aspirations of refugees themselves &amp;ndash; to enable receiving societies to see them as contributors. This requires significant investment in job creation and public services like education and health that benefit both refugees and nearby host communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. "Self-reliance" programmes of the kind you examine in the book began in Greece in the 1920s for refugees fleeing Ottoman Empire states. What political conditions existed there at the time that made these programmes viable? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-reliance is the idea that refugees can be empowered to live independently of aid &amp;ndash; for example, by having the right to work and freedom of movement within a host country. Yet too often today, refugee-hosting countries deny refugees access to labour markets and insist they live indefinitely in refugee camps. &amp;ldquo;Self-reliance&amp;rdquo; has taken-off in refuge policy debates, but it is not a new idea. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Greece worked with the League of Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support refugees to work in agriculture across the country. It was able to do this partly because of labour shortages and surplus arable land, partly because many arriving were Greek Orthodox and so welcomed by the receiving society, and partly because Greece enjoyed the support of the international community through the International Labour Organisation (ILO).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A century on from the early Greek experiment, Dollo Ado in Ethiopia is a model for how refugees and hosts can actually work alongside one another in cooperatives. How does the model work &amp;ndash; and how was it originally sold to the host community? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The five Dollo Ado camps were created just over a decade ago to provide sanctuary to Somali refugees fleeing conflict and drought. Despite being in an arid, insecure region with limited infrastructure, they have benefited from an innovative new approach to refugee assistance. The cooperative model offers group-based income-generating activities in areas such as agriculture, livestock, and energy. Half of the members are refugees and half are members of the host community. They have been created through unprecedented private sector investment; the IKEA Foundation has invested over $100m, including in relevant infrastructure such as irrigation. The cooperatives have led to increases in income-levels for both refugees and locals, as well as improving relations between refugees and hosts. The key to them being accepted has been that the host community has shared the benefits of these employment programmes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Do you feel a Dollo Ado-style model could ever work in towns in the UK that host refugee communities, especially where there can be significant local hostility towards refugees? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s crucial that host communities perceive that they benefit from the presence of refugees. Effective refugee policies need to ensure improved access to jobs and public services for both refugees and citizens living in refugee-hosting areas. This applies as much in the UK as it does in Ethiopia. We know from existing research that refugees can make a positive net economic contribution to host societies, whether in high or low-income countries. In the Ethiopian context, the presence of refugee camps has created thousands of jobs for citizens and new markets likely to be worth more than $50m in annual household expenditure. Research in Europe and the United States suggests that refugees&amp;rsquo; tax contributions are greater than spending on public programmes for refugees, and that they contribute to GDP by starting new businesses and replacing aging populations. We also know that in both Europe and Africa, it is refugees&amp;rsquo; economic contributions that matter most for shaping host community attitudes towards refugees. The difficulty is that political decision-making is not always shaped by evidence relating to economic contribution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The UK government right now is going to great lengths to deter refugees from arriving here. Is this a government that cannot, for whatever reason, see refugees as potential contributors, and instead sees them only as a burden? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The British government has consciously created policies to deter the arrival of asylum-seekers. Its policies have deliberately nurtured a &amp;ldquo;hostile environment&amp;rdquo; and the current UK Borders and Nationality Bill criminalises the arrival of asylum seekers via irregular routes. The government views reducing asylum claims in the UK as a political necessity: in 2021 opinion polls reveal that immigration is the single most important issue, and it made (unrealistic) commitments that Brexit would mean sovereign borders. But underlying this is also a failure to recognise that around two-thirds of asylum seekers coming to the UK are refugees in need of international protection, and refugees are not an inevitable burden. Not only do we have humanitarian obligations towards refugees, but they can make significant contributions, and demographic trends and labour shortages make their contributions especially important. The UK government and British media need to recognise these contributions and change the narrative on refugees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. What would be needed to get greater buy-in for the idea of refugee self-reliance and long-term settlement in countries where intolerance is high? Is it merely that political conditions need to change, or do those who argue that the economy can&amp;rsquo;t absorb a sizeable expansion in labour without entailing loss of jobs for locals have a valid point? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In low and middle-income countries that host most of the world&amp;rsquo;s refugees, there is huge variation in policies. While some, such as Uganda and Colombia, offer refugees the right to work and freedom of movement, others like Tanzania and Bangladesh insist on the encampment of refugees. But some countries, such as Ethiopia and Kenya, have also embarked on gradual change. The key to opening up self-reliance opportunities and socio-economic rights for refugees in these countries is to ensure that the national governments and local authorities in refugee-hosting regions benefit. Development assistance, trade concessions, and private sector investment are needed to ensure receiving country politicians recognise a benefit. Jordan, for instance, changed its policies to allow Syrian refugees to work because of a combination of trade concessions from the European Union and finance from the World Bank. Rich countries have a strong incentive to support this type of change in host countries because it offers a means to reduce the need for onward migration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. There is a lag between arrival of refugees and the point at which they become net economic contributors. Several studies in Australia found that refugees only begin to make a positive economic contribution 10 or 12 years after settling. Does this reality complicate any advocacy for long-term integration, particularly among already deprived communities who are asked to host refugee populations? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evidence from Australia and also the United States relating to the integration of, for example, Vietnamese refugees, does suggest that some of the contributions by refugees are lagged over time. The most significant contributions often come from the second-generation children of refugees. This observed lag has also been evident to some extent in Germany&amp;rsquo;s integration of over one million Syrian refugees. It stems from the fact that when refugees move from poor countries to rich countries they often lack the education and skills to immediately contribute to high productivity economies. It takes time to provide the necessary educational and training opportunities. This can be addressed partly through clear public communication and upfront investment in education and vocational education opportunities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. You mention two countries, Tanzania and Denmark, where a generally tolerant historic attitude towards refugees has been replaced by an intolerant one. But for countries that have moved in the opposite direction, what role did self-reliance programmes play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several refugee-hosting countries have moved in a progressive direction. In 2016, Jordan changed its policy of not allowing Syrian refugees to access labour markets, allowing them to work in selected sectors. It did so partly because of an agreement called the Jordan Compact that offered the country EU trade concessions and World Bank concessionary finance in return for letting refugees work. In 2019, Ethiopia adopted new legislation that potentially gives refugees the right to work and freedom of movement. It did so because of international support for its national development strategy that offered support for Ethiopian industrialisation in exchange for offering jobs to refugees. In 2021, Colombia committed to allowing the temporary integration of all of its 1.7 million Venezuelan refugees in the country, partly because donor countries committed to support the country&amp;rsquo;s development-based approaches for refugee-hosting cities. In all of these cases, international support for job-creation programmes that benefit both refugees and citizens have been crucial for unlocking progressive policy change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. What can we take from the examples of countries that have gradually opened up to refugees, particularly when arguments against integrating refugees are likely to intensify in the future as a result of depleted resources and greater global precarity? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advocacy for refugee rights is becoming increasingly challenging around the world. Automation, offshoring, the rise of China and the economic legacy of Covid-19 are all adding to feelings of vulnerability among citizens in Europe and North America. Politicians often find it much easier to scapegoat migration than to explain the complexities of structural change in the global economy. Rights-based arguments based on international law are important, but they are increasingly falling on deaf ears. What is also needed is pragmatism, to create mechanisms to ensure that host societies around the world benefit - and perceive that they benefit - from the presence of refugees. This requires targeted policies that systematically improve access to employment and public services, such as education and health, for both refugees and nearby host community members.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sorry not to be in regular blogging mode at the moment. Here’s a video of our evidence session to parliament, where they are running an inquiry into research integrity. I think clinical trials are the best possible way to approach this issue.

Doctors, researchers, and patients cannot make truly informed choices about which treatments work best if they don’t have access to all the trial results. Earlier this year, I helped out […]</div>
