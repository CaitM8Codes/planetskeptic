<p class="lead">What do you get when a gang of far-right loons gather together to complain about modern medicine? An amazingly revealing expose of what actually bothers them. This essay, <a href="https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2022/04/in-medical-schools-woke-ideology-trumps-true-healthcare/">In Medical Schools, Woke Ideology Trumps True Healthcare</a>, is a summary of a discussion sponsored by the James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal, a far right conservative/libertarian organization that tries to tell universities what they ought to do, and they hosted a little group of conservative nuisances to whine about medical schools.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>The webinar, entitled “Hypocritical Oath: The Origins and Consequences of Woke Medical Education,” featured Dr. Sally Satel, a practicing psychiatrist, lecturer at the Yale University School of Medicine, and Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute <span style="color:red; font-family: georgia">[enough said]</span>; Aaron Sibarium, associate editor at the Washington Free Beacon <span style="color:red; font-family: georgia">[a conservative website founded by a billionaire hedge fund investor]</span>; and John Sailer, a research associate at the National Association of Scholars <span style="color:red; font-family: georgia">[I’ve <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/05/17/the-rabidly-martial-rhetoric-of-that-bad-philosopher-peter-boghossian/">written about these clowns before</a>]</span> and author of numerous articles on “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) in medical education. </p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, no! Not the “Wokes” again! Perhaps they’ll start out by defining what they mean by “woke”.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Satel began the talk by speaking about how woke ideology has taken over psychiatric care. She stated, “any kind of psychotherapy that takes place under such conditions, where patients are reflexively branded as oppressed and encouraged to see themselves as feeble victims, is doomed to fail.” She made the point that therapy is meant to help individuals identify the inadvertent ways in which they undermine their best interests and how they can adapt if they are unable to change. To be sure, one’s health can be affected by social factors—but not exclusively. There are other factors that impact health, despite the new social doctrine of the day.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, that’s not what it means. I agree that any psychotherapy that <q>reflexively branded as oppressed and encouraged to see themselves as feeble victims</q> their patients is going to fail, but that’s not what goes on. Can you imagine trying to motivate a mass movement under the banner of “YOU’RE ALL FEEBLE VICTIMS!” Sorry, nope, being conscious of oppressive social systems is not the same as accepting victimhood.</p>
<p>She also parrots the conservative/libertarian line about personal responsibility.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>The choices one makes on a daily basis, for example, have long-term effects on health. Satel highlighted an often ignored fact: individuals, no matter their circumstances, still have some agency when it comes to their own health. Unfortunately, the concept of individual agency has slowly withered away, replaced by the far more popular victimhood ideology. In today’s victimhood society, it is almost unthinkable to take responsibility for one’s actions and the possible negative effects they may have. </p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, personal responsibility is important. So why can’t rich entitled folks acknowledge their personal responsibility for denying others civil rights, or a living wage, or some measure of security in housing and food? Everyone has some agency, but we also have an unequal distribution of privilege and ability. We have “some” agency, but we also have “some” unfair societal biases. Sally Satel does not work harder than someone in an Amazon warehouse, and “personal responsibility” isn’t going to pay your medical bills.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Sailer spoke next about how institutional policy has resulted in woke medical schools. He noted that UNC-Chapel Hill has twenty-four paid DEI officers, and half of these officers are in fields related to healthcare (12), and a majority of those are in the medical school (8). The university, as a result, has convened a task force to integrate social justice into the curriculum. Sailer says these kinds of policies and task forces are present on almost all medical campuses in the country. </p>
<p>DEI and social justice, for example, are now a part of the tenure and promotion process at many medical schools. This means that if one objects to the politically correct idea of the day, one’s job as a professor may be in jeopardy. Objective truths such as, “a man is a man, and a woman is a woman,” may now cause faculty to lose their jobs. </p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa there, John. You forgot to tell us why diversity and equality and social justice are bad things for doctors to learn about. Why shouldn’t we expect a doctor to care about the health and welfare of their patients? Shouldn’t doctors oppose unhealthy working and living conditions? </p>
<p>Also, you’re being sneaky and dishonest, John. <q>a man is a man, and a woman is a woman</q> is only an objective truth if you’ve clearly defined what you mean by the complex terms “woman” and “man”, and I suspect you’re trying to smuggle in some bigotry.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Sailer also spoke about the White Coats for Black Lives group and its beliefs. Its members believe in a variety of radical notions including, but not limited to: dismantling fatphobia, abolishing prisons, dismantling capitalism, and queer/trans liberation. What is remarkable is the effectiveness with which this radical group has enacted concrete policy changes, including at the University of Michigan, the University of California-Davis, the University of Minnesota, and many others. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes? Again, what is your objection to dismantling fatphobia? Do you think we should build more prisons? Do you fail to see the glaring flaws in capitalism? What do you want, queer/trans imprisonment? Sailer is simply taking for granted that his audience opposes these things that humane people with the goal of making the world better are trying to implement. Just like his “a man is a man” statement is just a call for bigots to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>I look at the list of things these anti-“wokists” oppose, and they all look like fine ideas to me, and they always fail to explain why they’re agin’ ’em. What’s wrong with queer/trans liberation? What are they afraid will happen if queer people have equal rights and autonomy and are protected from discrimination and hate? It’s the unspoken stuff behind their words that is most revealing.</p>
<p>Please, medical schools, continue to make it a priority to train doctors to be ethical human beings who respect the existence of others. That’s what “woke” really means, you know.</p>

    <title>IT’S ALIVE!!?!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;A giant squid washed ashore in Japan. Surprisingly, it was still alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;VIDEO:  Giant squid washes ashore alive in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A giant squid 3.35 metres in length has been found alive on a shore in western Japan.&lt;br /&gt;Giant squid live in the deep sea, and is unusual for one to be washed ashore alive. The squid has now been transported to an aquarium &lt;a href="https://t.co/FGdc23MBjI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FGdc23MBjI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; AFP News Agency (@AFP) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1517406552776667136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks like a sick squid to me &amp;#8212; alive, but barely. I&amp;#8217;m seeing conflicting reports that it&amp;#8217;s already died, or that it&amp;#8217;s living in an aquarium, or that it was airlifted to a secret kaiju laboratory on a remote volcanic island in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who wants to break the news to them?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;I consider this a clear case of pathological skepticism. Or perhaps more charitably, naive skepticism. A professional 747 pilot has set up a kickstarter to charter a passenger jet to fly from Rio de Janeiro to Perth, passing over Antarctica, to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; to flat-earthers that the Earth is spherically, or at least, that Antarctica isn&amp;#8217;t an ice wall surrounding the rim of a disc-shaped earth. Why would you think that this, on top of all the far easier to obtain evidence, is the final clincher to convince a tiny group of delusional ranters that they are wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="center"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHJIPzvcbSQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s going to cost $1.5 million dollars to book this 16 hour flight, and it&amp;#8217;s all supposedly for the benefit of educating flat earthers. Buy them a good introductory physics book instead. It&amp;#8217;s less flashy, but probably more likely to work, given that this isn&amp;#8217;t going to work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics ought to be familiar with studies of the end-of-the-world cults, in which a prophet predicts armageddon or the rapture or some such nonsense to occur on a specific date, and the cultists gather and pray and wait and…nothing happens. It turns out that they don&amp;#8217;t instantly drop their beliefs, which were socially expensive to acquire &amp;#8212; getting ostracized by the out-group hurts &amp;#8212; and which gave them the benefit of being valued by the in-group. Instead, they rationalized (that is, made excuses) and believed even more firmly. The flat-earthers are also a gang of conspiracy theorists who will invent various subterfuges that were made to undermine the truth by the pilot, who is obviously part of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s apparent that the flat-earthers don&amp;#8217;t believe in their delusion because they&amp;#8217;ve used science, so why would you imagine science would get them to think otherwise? Also, even a glance at most flat-earth literature will reveal that it&amp;#8217;s all paranoid religious gobbledy-gook, and they aren&amp;#8217;t going to be dissuaded by an airplane ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a documentary, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Li0ooV"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Behind the Curve&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about these fanatics. They are repeatedly shown evidence that demonstrate they are wrong, and they even design their own experiments to prove the earth is flat which consistently fail. They don&amp;#8217;t change their minds. This is more of the same, only with a $1.5 million price tag, and it&amp;#8217;s going to be another exercise in futility.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The results are in!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2022/04/26/the-results-are-in/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&amp;nbsp;or more).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Playground for the soul</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5963/playground-for-the-soul#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/bZZTUqMo.jpeg" height="797" alt="How The Light Gets In festival" width="1417" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dreams and jeopardy. It&amp;rsquo;s an intriguing theme for a festival, but wholly in keeping with the ambitious and boundary-hopping spirit of &lt;a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/hay?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;amp;utm_campaign=HTLGIHay2022&amp;amp;utm_id=Partner"&gt;HowTheLightGetsIn&lt;/a&gt;, which will be welcoming guests to sample its smorgasbord of big ideas in early June this year. In part, it&amp;rsquo;s an acknowledgement of a historical moment: the summer of 2022. Things are starting to move again, the future is once more opening up, and yet, as the organisers put it, &amp;ldquo;we are faced once more with some of the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest questions, and are asking the world&amp;rsquo;s leading thinkers to help us solve them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Held on the banks of the River Wye, the festival attracting the kinds of people who want to engage with philosophical questions, outside of the ivory tower of academia. As its founder Hilary Lawson told us in a &lt;a href="/articles/5960/were-bringing-philosophy-into-british-culture"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt;, the festival aims to encourage debate between disciplines, and &amp;ldquo;change the way people think about what philosophy is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speakers this year include Nobel-prize winning physicist Roger Penrose, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Andrea Elliott, best-selling author Yuval Noah Harari and trailblazing physicist and author Lisa Randall. The idea is to bring international philosophers at the top of their fields together with influential politicians, scientists and cultural figures. As philosophy partners of the festival, we&amp;rsquo;re delighted to also see a fair few New Humanist contributors in the lineup, including the writer and theoretician of desire Katherine Angel, philosopher Massimo Puggluci, journalist and feminist Minna Salami, and legendary biologist and honorary associate of the Rationalist Assocation, Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, New Humanist Editor Samira Shackle will be chairing a debate on &amp;ldquo;Necessity and Lies&amp;rdquo;, with the founder of the festival and philosopher Hilary Lawson, scientist Simon Baron-Cohen and alt-left thinker Rebecca Roache. Should we recognise that lying can be valuable, and sometimes necessary, for ourselves and those in power? Or is honesty not only essential in public life but vital in all aspects of our everyday life as well?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Jubilee Bank Holiday, and part of bringing the big ideas down to earth is to unwind and have some fun - hence the inclusion of comedy, art and music. It's why the festival bills itself as a "playground of the soul". The London Afrobeat Collective will be there, along with sequin-clad satirical performers Bourgeois and Maurice, &amp;ldquo;Essex Arab Girl Comedian&amp;rdquo; Esther Manito, and Groove Armada&amp;rsquo;s Tom Findlay on the decks - just some of the 450 speakers and performers, on 12 stages over the festival's four days. You can see the full programme &lt;a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/hay/programme?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;amp;utm_campaign=HTLGIHay2022&amp;amp;utm_id=Partner"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, including events for children and young adults. As Socrates said, philosophy begins in wonder, and who is more awestruck than the young?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Started in a chapel, with a small attendance, in 2018, HowTheLightGetsIn has been something of an unexpected success. Yet why should it be a surprise that people want to engage in the fundamental questions around their own existence. We're all human, after all, and life is a wonderful, puzzling thing. After the inevitable hiatus of the pandemic, it feels right to come together to challenge and enrich our ideas about the world, to learn to dream again, while sounding a note of caution around the need for care and reflection: the "jeopardy" of this year's theme. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you there, in Hay-on-Wye, on 2-5 June. New Humanist readers get a 20 per cent discount, with the promo code NEWHUMANIST20. Otherwise, for those who can&amp;rsquo;t attend in person, the festival will be streamed online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See &lt;a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/hay/festival-passes?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;amp;utm_medium=Preview&amp;amp;utm_campaign=HTLGIHay2022&amp;amp;utm_id=Partner"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for tickets to the event. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those of you who can't be with us in person, the festival will also be streaming online during the 2nd-5th June.

<p class="lead">As I announced yesterday, I’m clearing out the accumulated bookage of my office shelves and giving away free books on Patreon. Patreon has a few rules I have to follow, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can’t bribe people to sign up for Patreon, which is fair enough, so it has to be open to anyone and everyone.</li>
<li>I can’t use chance to decide who gets the books, because then it would be a raffle. No gambling allowed!</li>
</ul>
<p>So here’s my plan. I’m going to show you three pairs of books, each pair consisting of one lovely, useful, science-filled textbook, and one horrid, wretched, lying piece of garbage. You have to accept them as a set, although they’re yours at that point, and I can’t tell you what to do to them. I only ask that you don’t give away creationist trash to libraries or whatever; let’s keep those away from impressionable minds, OK? The good texts are still useful, they’re older editions or redundant copies, and not white elephants at all. The others? Just trash I want to get rid of.</p>
<p>The way this will work is that I’ll list 3 pairs, Set A, B, and C, and you can <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/65594125">comment on Patreon</a> and let me know which set you want. Say why! I’ll use your comment to judge who gets them this time. If you don’t get it, don’t panic! I have lots and lots of books, and plan to do this weekly.</p>
<p>I have to add one other pragmatic criterion: I’ll favor North American recipients, and will be sparing in sending them overseas, just to save myself some extravagant shipping costs. I won’t totally exclude you furriners, though — if you give me a really good reason, I’ll find a way.</p>
<p>Here are this week’s choices:<br/>
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetA-cell.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetA-cell-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-66345" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetA-cell-236x300.jpg 236w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetA-cell-118x150.jpg 118w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetA-cell-768x975.jpg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetA-cell-500x635.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetA-cell.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px"/></a><br/>
Set A: Essential Cell Biology, 4th edition, by Alberts and others. It’s a good basic cell &amp; molecular textbook. I’ve got a couple of copies of the most recent edition, so I can spare this one. I’ve paired it with one of Michael Behe’s, The Edge of Evolution. I’ll never read that book again, it was a waste of time the first time, but maybe you can a use for it.<br/>
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetB-genetics.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetB-genetics-251x300.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-66346" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetB-genetics-251x300.jpg 251w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetB-genetics-125x150.jpg 125w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetB-genetics-768x919.jpg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetB-genetics-500x599.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetB-genetics.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px"/></a><br/>
Set B: Essentials of Genetics, ninth edition, by Klug and others (this one is paper bound). It’s a solid introduction to transmission genetics. Again, I’ve got multiple editions and copies, and I teach out of Concepts of Genetics, so this is another quality text I don’t need. I’m throwing in Jeanson’s Replacing Darwin, since if you understand genetics at an undergrad level you’ll be able to see why it’s crap.<br/>
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetC-neuro.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetC-neuro-258x300.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-66347" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetC-neuro-258x300.jpg 258w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetC-neuro-129x150.jpg 129w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetC-neuro-768x893.jpg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetC-neuro-500x582.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/04/SetC-neuro.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px"/></a><br/>
Set C: Neuroscience, 3rd edition, by Purves and others. Most of the neurobiology texts I’ve gone are great thick monsters, but this one is comparatively slender and digestible. It’s still a good reference text, though. I’m flinging Meyer’s ungodly bad Signature in the Cell at it, since he seems to be under the delusion that he understands intelligence and the mind. He doesn’t.</p>
<p>Let’s give this a try! If you’re interested, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/65594125">leave a comment that says which set interests you</a>, why you would find the books interesting, and mention if you live overseas (which won’t disqualify you, it just means I’ll be limiting my expenses a bit). I’ll make a decision by next weekend and get another set ready.</p>
<p>Help me clear 20cm off my bookshelf!</p>

    <title>In a word: "Immunise"</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5952/in-a-word-immunise#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Two glass ampoules of cholera serum, Paris, France, 1916 (Wellcome Images / Wikimedia Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Two_glass_ampoules_of_cholera.jpg" height="961" alt="cholera serum" width="1252" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;immunise&amp;rdquo; is a latecomer into English. The first known recorded use is in 1889 in a journal called &lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sanatorian.&lt;/span&gt; It noted that living organisms could be &amp;ldquo;immunized&amp;rdquo; through injection without tissue damage. This turning of the word &amp;ldquo;immune&amp;rdquo; into a verb may have come via the German verb &amp;ldquo;immunisieren&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The root of the word, however, is the Latin &amp;ldquo;immunis&amp;rdquo;, meaning exempt from taxation. &amp;ldquo;Munis&amp;rdquo; meant being ready for service, so with &amp;ldquo;im&amp;rdquo; in front of it, you were the opposite. As was often the case, the word was absorbed into Romance languages, taking the usual pathway into English via French.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;In the 15th century, you could talk of clergymen being &amp;ldquo;immune&amp;rdquo; from tithes (taxes). By 1440 it was already being used in a broader sense, with God being described as immune from fraud, meaning that he was free or clear of it. Over time the term began to be used more figuratively. In 1922, D. H. Lawrence wrote in his short story &amp;ldquo;England, my England&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Among the graves, she was immune to the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;As a medical term, the word is a keyhole into the history of a form of treatment that now dominates the airwaves. A 30 June 1866 article in the &lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lancet&lt;/span&gt; notes: &amp;ldquo;Mr Lee then goes on to say that the skin will in time become immune to other irritants as well.&amp;rdquo; Being immune as a result of an inoculation was first recorded in English in 1882, with the great Louis Pasteur credited with creating immunity to anthrax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The Covid-19 virus has turned a lot of us, somewhat dangerously, into amateur medics talking in our living rooms about an &amp;ldquo;immune response&amp;rdquo; (first recorded in 1923), our &amp;ldquo;immune system&amp;rdquo; (1943), or an &amp;ldquo;immune deficiency&amp;rdquo; (1965). The phrase &amp;ldquo;herd immunity&amp;rdquo; first appeared in 1917, applied, as you might expect, to cattle. As the pandemic hit the UK in March 2020, I noted that three government scientists used the phrase on a single day on radio and TV, as did the journalist Robert Peston in the&lt;span class="s1"&gt; Spectator. &lt;/span&gt;By then, we had become the &amp;ldquo;herd&amp;rdquo;. However, the phrase &amp;ldquo;death rate&amp;rdquo; (1849) did not accompany it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Srebrenica Genocide Memorial, Srebrenica" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/43550402932_d583d51855_o.jpg" height="864" alt="Srebrenica&amp;ndash;Potočari Memorial and Cemetery for the Victims of the 1995 Genocide. Image: Mike Norton" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Journalist Ed Vulliamy once noted that &amp;ldquo;within 20 years of the liberation of Dachau&amp;hellip; the Beatles were playing Hamburg&amp;rdquo;. No such thawing of relations or moving-on has meaningfully taken place in the Balkan region. There is still an urgent need for reconciliation. Meanwhile, a whole generation have grown up in the long shadow of the war, hearing three rival nationalist narratives from respective governments. To this day, the government in Serbia refuses to recognise that the massacre of 8,000 Bosnia Muslim (or Bosniak) boys and men in the town of Srebrenica in 1992 constitutes genocide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why has transitional justice proved so challenging in the Balkans? On the face of it, there seems to be progress. The final two criminal cases related to the Yugoslav wars were concluded last year by the international court in the Hague. However, the process of pursuing justice at a local level has largely stalled, with many cases yet to be heard. Meanwhile, nationalist politicians have sought to undermine the institutions of Bosnia and dismember the state. Still, there are people and organisations working to pursue transitional justice in the region, holding perpetrators to account and attempting a measure of reconciliation between groups on different sides of the conflicts. How can the region move on from the current reality of frozen conflict?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The first war crimes court since Nuremberg&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reconciliation process had once been geared around the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, set up in 1993 by the UN to prosecute war crimes committed in the region. It later spread to the whole region, including Kosovo. The court operated for twenty-four years, indicting 161 people, conducting 111 trials, and convicting 90 people from all sides of the conflict &amp;ndash; including the first sitting head of a state to be indicted for war crimes, Slobodan Milosevic. In many ways it was ground-breaking. The first war crimes court to be established since the end of the Second World War, it issued important judgements on rape as a weapon of war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David Tolbert worked at the court on and off for nine years, starting as a senior legal officer. While many people looked back to the Nuremberg Trials as an antecedent, he feels that the ICTY was &amp;ldquo;the first of its kind&amp;rdquo;. He is positive about the record of the court, which indicted a larger number of people and accounted for all of them, when comparable efforts at justice in countries such as Rwanda and Cambodia have struggled. The prosecutors were facilitated by political will to make arrests and were also able to make links between some of the defendants where they had been working together to commit crimes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The ICTY building, The Hague" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ICTY_Building,_The_Hague.jpg" height="867" alt="ICTY building, The Hague" width="1417" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the court also faced challenges and attracted criticism from all sides. Securing the support of national governments was a significant block, especially early on. &amp;ldquo;In Serbia the cooperation was really difficult and also in Republic Srpska [the majority Serb areas in Bosnia],&amp;rdquo; says Tolbert, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s where we really needed political support from NATO and the NATO countries.&amp;rdquo; That support did come, with NATO troops making arrests and transferring a suspected war criminal to the ICTJ. Tolbert feels the court improved over time in terms of dealing with this political engagement and in helping make arrests. He noted that there was a &amp;ldquo;pretty big learning curve&amp;rdquo; for those involved to begin to understand the context, and then to create the mechanisms to make arrests and gather evidence, given that the ICTY was an international court and those involved mostly came from outside the region.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The court also made its own blunders. One of the most emotive was the loss of personal belongings of Srebrenica victims. Originally removed from mass grave sites in 1996-97, these items were destroyed in 2009 on the grounds they had started to decompose. They included documents and photos that could help identify the remains of victims. The convoluted and opaque system that allowed this to happen without the prior knowledge of victims&amp;rsquo; groups and families underlined the failures of trust and communication. The ICTY finally closed its doors in 2017, leaving a mixed legacy and a handful of cases to finish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Failing survivors?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A year later, the Balkans Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) published a report into the state of transitional justice in the region. &amp;ldquo;Accountability, truth and justice still seem more like ideals than reality,&amp;rdquo; the report said, going on to set out how prosecutions by national governments had fallen, regional cooperation had collapsed, and victims and survivors had been &amp;ldquo;betrayed&amp;rdquo;. For example, the report noted that while there had been 3,500 prosecutions in Croatia, just 119 were against Croatian soldiers, and their sentences were lower than for people from other ethnicities for the same categories of crimes. While the ICTY did set those ground-breaking precedents on rape as a weapon of war, a recent survey of survivors found a majority of survivors felt abandoned by the civil justice system because it is very difficult for them to claim compensation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ICTY is now seen by many as a failure. Rather than bringing closure to victims, or paving the way for societal-level reconciliation, they see the court as having amplified the voices of wartime leaders. While many such leaders were prosecuted, their trials gave them the platform and space to pontificate and propagate their ultranationalist ideologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most surreal example of this was the infamous suicide of Slobodan Praljak in the Hague court. A former Bosnian Croat general, Praljac had been found guilty of committing violations of the laws of war, crimes against humanity, and breaches of the Geneva Convention. On hearing the guilty verdict in 2017, he swallowed cyanide in the courtroom. The act somewhat grotesquely became an internet meme in the late 2010s to characterise an excessive emotional reaction to a situation ("excuse me while I drink my poison").&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The later acquittal of Serb leader Vojislav Seselj &amp;ndash; who had been charged with incitement of torture, murder, forcible deportations and persecution on religious and racial grounds, but was found to have had had no military &amp;ldquo;hierarchical responsibility&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; was for many anti-nationalist campaigners in the region the death knell of the ICTY&amp;rsquo;s legitimacy. Seselj received and was quickly rehabilitated by the Serbian political establishment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Vojislav Seselji on TV Kopernikus, 2018" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Snezana_Djordjevic_i_Vojislav_Seselj.jpg" height="900" alt="Vojislav &amp;Scaron;e&amp;scaron;elj" width="1600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the absence of meaningful and effective transitional justice in the region, society continues to be divided along ethnic lines. The starkest example is Bosnia, a multi-ethnic state of Bosniaks (or, as many prefer to be called, Bosnian Muslims), Croats and Serbs. While schools in the country nominally promote &amp;ldquo;democratic&amp;rdquo; values, in practice they are ethnically and linguistically segregated, meaning three very different versions of history are being taught. This not only reinforces those ethno-nationalist discourses, but has made it more challenging for those children and young people, to process the pasts and their sense of who they are and where they belong. Many of the Bosnia-wide institutions, such as public broadcasting and sports, that might have contributed to a sense of national unity beyond ethnic divides, have been undermined over the years by a persistent campaign from Serb and Croat separatists. Nor are the tensions confined to Bosnia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Transitional justice from the grassroots&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What might the future hold for the region&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;frozen conflict&amp;rdquo;? Despite the failures of the ICTY and other &amp;ldquo;top-down&amp;rdquo; efforts, some remarkable people and organisations have stepped up at the grassroots. One of the earliest bodies to pursue transitional justice, the Humanitarian Law Centre, was founded in the early stages of the conflicts in 1992. The HLC has played a significant role in Balkan civil society over the last three decade, both tirelessly documenting the Milosevic-era war crimes and human rights violations committed in the 1992-1995 conflict, predominantly against Croats and Bosnian Muslims, and, simultaneously, collecting evidence &amp;ndash; with a view to both prosecutions and societal-level "truth-telling" &amp;ndash; of war crimes and human rights violations in the 1999 conflict in Kosovo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HLC&amp;rsquo;s work in Kosovo is crucial, as many other Serbian human rights organisations would still rather not engage in the country. The idea that "Kosovo is Serbia" still holds sway among sections of Serbian society steeped in the mythologised narrative of the 1389 Field of Blackbirds battle and glorified in the poetry of the nineteenth-century Serb Orthodox/ Montegrin poet Njegos, and the claim was arguably the most central tenet of Milosevic&amp;rsquo;s ultranationalist ideology, from whence all other racist and exclusivist positions emanated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HLC&amp;rsquo;s founder, Natasha Kandic, has been the subject of dozens of lawsuits from Serbian public officials during the past 25 years as a result of her public criticism and work on Serbia&amp;rsquo;s war crimes, documenting atrocities committed in both 1992-1995 in Bosnia and Croatia, and 1999 in Kosovo. It was Kandic who provided what is considered the &amp;ldquo;smoking gun&amp;rdquo; for Serbia&amp;rsquo;s involvement in the Srebrenica Massacre: a video of Serbian soldiers from the Skorpions Unit executing six Bosnian Muslim prisoners. The video, presented as evidence to the ICTY, was also partially broadcast on Serbian and Bosnian TV. She continues to be a key figure across the human rights and transitional justice movement in the former Yugoslavia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kandic also spearheaded the RECOM initiative, which in 2008 initiated the creation of a regional &amp;ldquo;peace commission for the people&amp;rdquo;, focusing on documenting war crimes along with truth-telling and processing the past through public initiatives. The aim was that this documentation of war crimes committed by "all sides" in the 1990s would be used to secure prosecution. RECOM made significant breakthroughs, not only in presenting an alternative to the one-sided narratives and ultranationalist rhetoric of leading political parties in Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, but also in helping to mobilise and coordinate progressive and pro-human rights actors across all countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RECOM&amp;rsquo;s work spoke to the need articulated by anti-nationalist, feminist Croatian writer Slavenka Drakulic to bridge the chasm "between official history and collective memory", as a necessary stage of societal-level healing. Its work dovetailed with the Croatian-based initiative, Dokumenta, an organisation formed in 2004 with the aim of investigating and establishing truth so as to create a &amp;ldquo;sustainable peace by dealing with the past.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The emergence of these independent bodies in the late 2000s thus seemed to many progressive activists and academics in the region a tonic to the toxic legacies of the 1990s war that had begun to appear in the election of ultranationalists and the routine denial of facts (even when, as in the case of the 1995 genocide in Srebrenica, such facts had been established both in the ICTY and other international courts).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both RECOM and Dokumenta speak to a need for shared narratives, whether these emerge through trials or through truth-telling. As Bosnian filmmaker Jasmila Zbanic illustrated through her 2010 film &lt;em&gt;For Those Who Can Tell No Tales&lt;/em&gt;, about what she calls the &amp;ldquo;endangered&amp;rdquo; memory of the Visegrad massacre, there is no justice without truth and no truth without justice. She recently won an Oscar for &lt;em&gt;Quo Vadis, Aida&lt;/em&gt; her exploration of collective memory and Srebrenica.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Still from the film " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Quo_vadis__Aida_Film_Still_2.jpg" height="844" alt="Still from Quo Vadis, Aida" width="1500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet, as RECOM representatives noted in an interview with us, these initiatives stand little chance of shifting from shared recognition of the facts to securing prosecutorial victories, in the face of the continued damage of ultranationalism in party politics. As they note: &amp;ldquo;Unfortunately, the situation in the region is very discouraging: number of war crime trials has been decreased; there are no indictments against high-ranked military and police officers; only judgments condemning members of other ethnic communities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Learning from the past&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tireless and painstaking work of documenting what actually happened during the conflict &amp;ndash; who did what to whom and when &amp;ndash; is both specific to the nature of the atrocities of the former Yugoslavia, and central to the development of what "transitional justice" as a whole can mean. Transitional justice, as a concept and practice, originally emerged out of the South American experiences of authoritarianism in the 1970s. The "right to know" emerged out of South America - and in particular Chile&amp;rsquo;s attempts to deal with the legacy of the Pinochet regime &amp;ndash; as the assertion by families that they, literally, had a right to know where "disappeared" loved ones were buried.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In practice, "transitional justice" quickly developed a binary. There was "truth and reconciliation" without prosecution on the one hand, such as the societal-level initiatives of post-apartheid South Africa. On the other hand, there was "prosecutorial justice",&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;such as the formal legal spaces of the ICTY and ICTR (the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last decade has seen a new "wave" of transitional justice in the wake of the 2011 Arab revolutions, and in fora such as the Tunisian Truth and Dignity Commission, a national organisation to process the authoritarian past of pre-2011 Tunisia. This new wave, and other national attempts to process the injustices of the past, owe the ICTY a debt of thanks for the paradigms they developed. However, is notable that those involved chose to combine the prosecutorial model of the ICTY with learning from South Africa&amp;rsquo;s reconciliatory experience of "processing the past". This suggests that it isn&amp;rsquo;t that the ICTY was a failure, but rather that it was "necessary but not sufficient" for the people of the region to gain closure from the horrors of the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bodies like RECOM and Dokumenta are effective where they work in tandem with the "official" transitional justice processes, such as the work that was undertaken at the ICTY. As RECOM said to us: &amp;ldquo;The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was crucial for judicially established facts that should serve as a basis for the establishment of the rule of law through domestic war crime trials. The RECOM Reconciliation Network as most trustworthy and credible actor of regional reconciliation is establishing a regional record of all the victims regardless of their ethnicity, despite the absence of political support&amp;rdquo;, using the ICTY judgments as the basis of their work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some sense, the greatest "victory" of the former Yugoslavia&amp;rsquo;s war-time victims in securing formal and structural change and recognition is a victory that has protected others who have suffered in subsequent conflicts &amp;ndash; that of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, which was adopted unanimously in 2000, and acknowledges the disproportionate and unique impact of armed conflict on women and girls, and provided the legal basis to prosecute war-time rape as a weapon of war. Securing Resolution 1325 remains an astonishing victory secured in large part through the work of Bosnian women's rights activists and NGOs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Prosecutions are important, particularly of senior leaders, military and political leaders, but I think a whole lot more needs to be done and that hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened,&amp;rdquo; says David Tolbert. &amp;ldquo;I would have wanted to have seen more transitional justice approaches.&amp;rdquo; Those could have included a truth commission, reparations, a lot of reforms, and political realignment. While he said there were discussions about a truth commission in Serbia, it was unclear whether they were serious. In the generation since the end of the wars of the former Yugoslavia, as Afghanistan and Iraq reformulated the concept of "humanitarian intervention" in the 2000s, and the Arab Revolutions and Euromaidan in Ukraine offered new modes and templates of how to "process the past" after an end of authoritarianism, the ICTY&amp;rsquo;s legacy, and the lessons it offers transitional justice processes that have followed it, remains a bridge &amp;ndash; towards justice, but not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The mental life of mountains</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5951/the-mental-life-of-mountains#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/mountains-1412683_1280-copy.jpg" height="603" alt="mountains" width="877" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Panpsychism is the doctrine that everything has a mind, or at least a mental aspect. It says that there is no sharp division between us, with our rich mental lives, and the rest of the world. Our minds are just complex forms of something that is present everywhere, and the whole universe &amp;ndash; mountains, clouds, asteroids, dust &amp;ndash; is infused with mental life. It is a beguiling view, which has appealed not only to poets and mystics but also to those seeking to understand the place of mind in the natural world. Many philosophers, from ancient times through to the early 20th century, have endorsed a version of it.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The view fell out of fashion in the mid-20th century as philosophers increasingly adopted a materialist outlook, which identifies minds with functioning brains. In recent years, however, panpsychism has undergone a philosophical renaissance, and it is now presented at major conferences and debated in mainstream journals. The contemporary form is somewhat different from older versions. It concerns only one aspect of the mind &amp;ndash; consciousness &amp;ndash; and it focuses on the presence of this aspect at the fundamental physical level.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Modern panpsychists hold that elementary particles such as electrons and quarks have simple forms of consciousness, and thus that everything in the universe is constructed from conscious elements. They claim that complex forms of consciousness in humans and other animals are built up from the simple consciousnesses of the particles that compose their bodies. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;If all this sounds like woo-woo to you, then you&amp;rsquo;ll find plenty of philosophers who agree. In a Twitter exchange, the Canadian neurophilosopher Patricia Churchland remarked that panpsychism is the consequence of knowing next to no science and asked, &amp;ldquo;What about Pixie dust? Leprechauns? Ghosts?&amp;rdquo; Yet panpsychists are not simply cranks. Some neuroscientists have proposed similar views, and one of the leading panpsychists, the British philosopher Philip Goff, has hailed the theory as providing the foundations for a new science of consciousness. So let&amp;rsquo;s look at the case for panpsychism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;The ghost in the machine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Most contemporary philosophers agree that the mind is not something distinct from the brain. There is no ghost in the machine, as the philosopher Gilbert Ryle put it. Rather, talking about the mind is just a different way of talking about the brain and what it does. The idea is that brains are complex control systems that process sensory signals and use the information to regulate behaviour. When we talk about mental states, such as experiences and thoughts, we are referring to states of these control systems, defined by the role they play within them.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Take the experience of smelling a rose. This is a state of the brain (a pattern of activation in certain brain regions) that is caused by a characteristic pattern of signals from receptor cells in the nose and carries information about the presence of roses. It also has a characteristic pattern of effects on other brain systems, producing rose-related memories, associations, beliefs, desires and other psychological reactions.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It is this distinctive pattern of causes and effects that makes it the experience it is &amp;ndash; smelling a rose, rather than seeing a blue sky or feeling dizzy. Every experience has its own distinctive profile of causes and effects, as does every other mental state. This view is known as functionalism, since it says that mental states are defined by the function they perform, rather than by the stuff they are made of, and it has been the dominant view in philosophy of mind since the 1970s.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Now, consciousness can also be thought of in this functionalist way. Not all mental states are conscious. Our brains continually register and use sensory information subliminally. Your olfactory system might detect a faint rose scent in the air and trigger a childhood memory of your grandmother&amp;rsquo;s garden without your being consciously aware of having smelt anything. Sensory information is conscious only when it has the right effects on the rest of the system. According to one account, this involves the information being &amp;ldquo;globally broadcast&amp;rdquo; to a range of higher mental systems, including ones for reasoning, decision-making, language, memory and emotion. When this happens, you &amp;ndash; the organism composed of all these brain systems &amp;ndash; can use the information flexibly, thinking about it, reporting it, recalling it and so on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;How does it make you feel?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;From this perspective, consciousness is just another aspect of brain functioning: global information sharing. The American philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett speaks of it as &amp;ldquo;fame in the brain&amp;rdquo;. But is that all there is to consciousness? Some philosophers say it is not. For the functionalist account seems to miss out something important &amp;ndash; the essence of consciousness, its subjective dimension. Information sharing in the brain may be the objective, public side of experience, which can be described by neuroscientists. But, these philosophers argue, there is also a subjective, private side to it &amp;ndash; what it is like for the creature undergoing it; how it feels on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take pain, for example. Functionalism says that pain is a state of the brain that is produced by stimulation of pain receptors, carries information about bodily damage and produces a range of reactions, both psychological (trauma-related emotions, thoughts, desires and memories) and behavioural (wincing, crying, complaining).&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But, the critics say, there is more to pain. There is the actual feel of it, the painfulness; what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be in pain. This seems to be distinct from the processes mentioned in the functionalist account. We could imagine all those processes occurring &amp;ndash; in a robot, perhaps &amp;ndash; without there being any subjective feeling at all.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This subjective feel isn&amp;rsquo;t a matter of what the brain state does, but of what it is like in itself, intrinsically, apart from all its causes and effects, and it is wholly private. With suitable instruments, neuroscientists could detect all the effects a pain state has in your brain, but they could never access its subjective feel.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Similarly for all other conscious experiences: seeing, hearing, tasting and so on. These are brain states which encode information and make it available to other brain systems, but (so goes the argument) they also have an intrinsic feel to them: what it&amp;rsquo;s like to see a sunset, hear birdsong, taste lemon juice and so on. Philosophers refer to this intrinsic &amp;ldquo;what-it-is-likeness&amp;rdquo; of experience as its phenomenal feel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Solving the "hard problem"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;So, we have two different conceptions of consciousness: an objective functional one (often called access consciousness) and a subjective phenomenal one (phenomenal consciousness). As we have seen, the functional form is not particularly mysterious. But phenomenal consciousness is another matter. How does a brain state come to have a subjective aspect, an intrinsic phenomenal feel, undetectable from the outside? There may not be a ghost in the machine, but there seems to be some ghostliness in it all the same.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This problem was given particularly forceful presentation in the mid-1990s by the Australian philosopher David Chalmers, who famously dubbed it the &amp;ldquo;hard problem of consciousness&amp;rdquo; (as opposed to the easy problems of explaining access consciousness).&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Many theories of phenomenal consciousness have been proposed, but all have serious weaknesses. Some seek to explain phenomenal feel in terms of properties of the brain, which is implausible, while others hold that there are basic laws of nature linking brain states with phenomenal feels, which seems arbitrary. It is this history of failure that has inspired some researchers to turn to panpsychism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Panpsychists point out that, in general, complex things are built up out of simpler ones. Brain states are complex structures built out of elementary particles. The phenomenal feels of these brain states (the way they feel to the person whose brain it is) are also complex, so isn&amp;rsquo;t it plausible that these, too, are built out of simpler elements?&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The most elegant view, panpsychists argue, is that elementary particles themselves have a very basic kind of phenomenal feel, and that the rich phenomenal feels of our brain states result from combining the feels of the particles that compose them. This is more plausible, they argue, than supposing that rich forms of phenomenal consciousness pop into existence fully formed in the brains of living creatures.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Of course, panpsychists don&amp;rsquo;t claim that elementary particles are conscious in the functional sense; they don&amp;rsquo;t think electrons have tiny brains which process sensory information and use it to control their behaviour. They claim only that particles have a basic kind of phenomenal consciousness &amp;ndash; an intrinsic phenomenal feel. And this does seem conceivable. A thing need not do anything in order to have an intrinsic aspect; it just has to exist, and elementary particles do that all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another consideration in favour of this view, which many see as a clincher. It comes from reflection on physics itself. Physics aims to describe the basic constituents of the universe, such as electrons and quarks. But, panpsychists point out, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell us what these things are, only how they behave. It describes them as having mass and charge and so on, but this is merely a way of describing how they interact with other particles and forces. (Mass, for example, is a disposition to resist acceleration.) We don&amp;rsquo;t know what the fundamental particles are like in themselves, intrinsically.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here, panpsychists say, is where consciousness comes in. For, they say, we do know the intrinsic nature of one aspect of physical reality: the bit inside our own skulls. When we attend to our experiences, we are directly aware of what our brain states are like in themselves, intrinsically, apart from all the effects they have. Panpsychists take this as a model for the intrinsic nature of physical things generally. Our best hypothesis, they say, is that electrons, quarks and other elementary particles are really tiny blobs of phenomenal feel: micro-consciousnesses.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We arrive at the following picture. Elementary particles are actually micro-consciousnesses. They behave in the way physics describes, and they interact and combine to create all the complex physical structures in the universe, including brains. In parallel, their phenomenal feels combine to create the complex phenomenal feels brains possess. It&amp;rsquo;s a neat story, which not only solves the &amp;ldquo;hard problem&amp;rdquo; but also explains what the intrinsic nature of matter is. What&amp;rsquo;s not to like?&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A lot, actually. For one thing, not all philosophers agree that elementary particles must have an intrinsic nature of some kind. Some think that physics tells us all there is to know about them. But let&amp;rsquo;s set that aside and focus on the panpsychist picture itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Inside the human brain&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Panpsychists acknowledge that their view faces problems. The most discussed of these is the combination problem. How do the trillions of micro-consciousnesses in my brain combine to form my consciousness? Can we even make sense of the idea of distinct consciousnesses fusing together? Since we have no idea what the consciousness of particles is like &lt;span class="s1"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;only the particles know!&lt;span class="s1"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; and we know nothing of the method by which they combine, we&amp;rsquo;re totally in the dark here. As the philosopher Yujin Nagasawa puts it, we&amp;rsquo;re in the position of someone trying to bake a cake without any idea of what the ingredients are or what the recipe is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more problems. For example, when do micro-consciousnesses come together? Panpsychists claim that the micro-consciousnesses of the particles in living brains combine. But why would they be the only sets of particles that do so? What about those in other bodily organs? Or in computers, trees, rocks or stars? We assume these things don&amp;rsquo;t have complex consciousnesses, but how do we know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If brains aren&amp;rsquo;t special in being the only things that possess consciousness at all, why should they be special in being the only things that possess a complex consciousness? Maybe all physical structures have a complex consciousness formed by the union of the micro-consciousnesses of their particles. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be the most elegant view? We have no way of knowing, of course, since we cannot detect the intrinsic nature of things.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There is a deeper problem, too. If the phenomenal feel of experience is the intrinsic nature of our brain states, then how are we aware of it? To be aware of something, we need a sensory system of some kind that can detect it. The brain probably has self-monitoring systems that can detect the experiences that are occurring within it. Experiences are brain states, and monitoring systems could detect them by sensing their objective physical characteristics, including the effects they have on the rest of the brain.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But by what means could a monitoring system peer into the intrinsic nature of these states &amp;ndash; what they are like subjectively, on the inside? How could one part of the brain see into the intrinsic nature of another part? We are faced with the bizarre possibility that we don&amp;rsquo;t know what our own experiences are like. My visual cortex may know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to see red, but I don&amp;rsquo;t! The absurdity of this conclusion suggests that something has gone seriously wrong somewhere.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Of course, panpsychists will reply that we don&amp;rsquo;t need self-monitoring systems to be aware of the phenomenal feel of our brain states. The feel, they will say, is what the brain states are like in themselves, and we are aware of it simply by being in those states. However, it is hard to make sense of this suggestion. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to be in a certain state and another to know that you are in it, and panpsychists offer no explanation of how we get from one to the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;The real lesson of the panpsychist renaissance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;You have probably guessed by now that I&amp;rsquo;m not convinced by panpsychism. In fact, I think the real lesson of the panpsychist renaissance is a negative one. If the search for a theory of phenomenal consciousness leads us to panpsychism, then we should question whether phenomenal consciousness really exists. Maybe functionalism doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave out anything after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true, of course, that the functionalist picture &lt;span class="s1"&gt;seems &lt;/span&gt;to leave out something, but maybe that&amp;rsquo;s a sort of illusion, due to the fact that we are not aware of the complexity of the processes involved in conscious experience. Perhaps, when we talk about what an experience feels like, we are referring, in an indistinct way, to the complex pattern of psychological effects it produces in us &amp;ndash; effects which, unlike phenomenal feels, can be detected by other brain systems. And as neuroscience tells us more about these effects and the mechanisms that make us sensitive to them, perhaps we shall lose the sense that there is anything more to consciousness.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Rather than heralding a new science of consciousness, panpsychism may be the last gasp of a prescientific view of what consciousness is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Accidental Gods</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5949/book-review-accidental-gods#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-07-at-12.10.17.jpg" height="669" alt="Accidental Gods" width="842" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;On the sweltering street corners of Kingston, Jamaica in the years before the Second World War, it would have been easy to find people ecstatically preaching while brandishing the June 1931 issue of &lt;span class="s1"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/span&gt; as if it was the Bible. In it were several reports of the coronation of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia. Still labouring under the British yoke, and with the stains of slavery still fresh, here was something remarkable: a Black man being crowned as a king, with the white lords and diplomats and emissaries of the world kneeling before him &amp;ndash; a complete inversion of the natural order. For some, this was so remarkable that it could only imply one thing: Haile Selassie must be a god, and he would redeem them. They prayed for the god-king to part the seas, that they could be borne from Jamaica to Abyssinia as compensation for the dreadful journeys made in the other direction only a few decades before.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Selassie&amp;rsquo;s original name was Ras Tafari Makonnen. In him lies the origin of Rastafarianism. To deride this story of a religion born in the 20th century would be to miss what has been so eloquently portrayed by Anna Della Subin in her debut book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Accidental Gods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: an excavation of the deep history of men (and it is almost always men) transformed into deities and demigods. Unearthing these tales is not, she writes, &amp;ldquo;an arcane theological puzzle&amp;rdquo; but an essential chart to the construction of &amp;ldquo;civilisation&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;To speak of men unwittingly turned divine,&amp;rdquo; she tells us, &amp;ldquo;is to sing a history of how the modern world came to be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her sense of the uncanny, the ironic, the profane and the weird, Subin is a charming guide. Here we find the cases of Prince Philip enshrined as an idol by a tiny community in Vanuatu, sacrifices to a red-headed East India Company officer in Peshawar, and &amp;ndash; perhaps a record in the field &amp;ndash; the hysterically manly visage of General Douglas MacArthur worshipped in four different places at different times. Subin&amp;rsquo;s unfurling narrative is best exemplified by the grandly deranged and hilarious tale of the Theosophist movement. The story begins in the village of Sibsey, Lincolnshire and traverses two high-profile court cases, the National Secular Society, P. G. Wodehouse&amp;rsquo;s brother, a pioneer of Hitler-worshipping fascist Hinduism, a paedophile ex-Anglican priest, and Russian seances, all culminating in the Indian independence movement and, of course, Mohandas Gandhi, who had to keep insisting all his life: &amp;ldquo;I am not a God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;As with the Rastafarians, what binds these eccentric desiderata together is empire. Throughout the period of colonial expansion, conquerors from Cort&amp;eacute;s to Columbus to Drake would find themselves hailed by Indigenous peoples as gods upon first arrival, and would take this holy praise as the celestial license to overpower and control. Through the need to count and codify subject populations the study of the &amp;ldquo;science of religion&amp;rdquo; evolved as a crucial imperial apparatus, exemplified here by Max M&amp;uuml;ller &amp;ndash; foremost expert on the languages and faiths of India, despite never having been there. With this knowledge in hand, rulers could claim that because these foreign practices never aligned fully with the correct Christian traditions, those people were still too backward to be granted independence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Of course, the supposedly supreme Christian definitions of &amp;ldquo;god&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;belief&amp;rdquo; did not hold true everywhere. A deity need not conform to the Biblical model of an omnipotent ruler in an eternal heaven somewhere &amp;ldquo;up there&amp;rdquo;, but could be a crucial part of the functioning of everyday life. Those who &amp;ldquo;worshipped&amp;rdquo; that red-headed East India Company officer were not venerating him at all: they were making offerings to placate a creature that more closely resembled a marauding devil. In other words, what Subin helps us to see is that at the very core of modernity lies the white god, sweating in his pith helmet.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
