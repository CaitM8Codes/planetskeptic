    <content type="html">&lt;p class="lead"&gt;I can see my future now, for at least the next four months. I have committed myself to record all of my lectures so the students have asynchronous access to the course content to maximize flexibility in case pandemic catastrophe strikes, so what I&amp;#8217;ve got to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every Monday and Wednesday, record my in-class lecture, then edit it and splice in the Keynote images I use. That means I put in my regular workday, and then when I get home that evening I get to play with Final Cut Pro. Two of those a week means I won&amp;#8217;t be doing anything fancy, just dubbing the slides and uploading it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every weekend, I put together a video to describe the lab experiment for the week. The last one might be the longest of the bunch at about a half hour, once the students get into the routine it may not be too bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every week I also assemble a clutch of problems for the students to solve. Those go on Canvas, our course management system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always glitches. Last week, the audio recording of the lecture was unlistenable, so I had to re-record the whole thing. That was better (but far from perfect) today. Today, though, the in-class technology through up a whole bunch of problems &amp;#8212; nothing worked until I called in IT to fix it, so I lost over 10 minutes to annoying problems. I intensely dislike the way the university has configured the AV in our classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, here&amp;#8217;s today&amp;#8217;s lecture. It&amp;#8217;s about chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Religious exemptions are a loophole for bigotry</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/01/24/religious-exemptions-are-a-loophole-for-bigotry/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">You had to know this was coming. <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/20/holston-united-methodist-home-for-children-adoption-tennessee-refused-family-jewish/6582864001/">Republicans in Tennessee were outraged that federal law prohibited discrimination</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In December, the Greenville-based Holston sued the Biden administration for regulations that prohibit discrimination in programs funded by U.S. Health and Human Services grants “on the basis of religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and same-sex marriage status,” saying it violates its First Amendment rights.</p></blockquote>
<p>So they did something. They passed a law to give religious adoption agencies a loophole, a law specifically designed to allow them to discriminate against same-sex couples. It was easy. Enabling bigotry against the people straight people dislike seems to be popular.</p>
<blockquote><p>The lawsuit comes nearly two years to the date that Gov. Bill Lee signed into law a measure that allows religious adoption agencies to deny service to same-sex couples. The law allows adoption agencies to refuse to participate in a child placement if doing so would “violate the agency’s written religious or moral convictions or policies.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/zerotolerance.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/zerotolerance-121x150.jpeg" alt="" width="121" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-65373" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/zerotolerance-121x150.jpeg 121w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/zerotolerance-241x300.jpeg 241w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/zerotolerance.jpeg 394w" sizes="(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px"/></a></p>
<p>But here it comes: that law is a blunt instrument that can be used against anyone. So a taxpayer-funded religious adoption agency used the new law as an excuse to deny a heterosexual couple the opportunity to adopt because…<em>they were Jewish</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Tennessee Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, promises religious freedom and equality for everyone. Tennessee is reneging on that promise by allowing a taxpayer-funded agency to discriminate against Liz and Gabe Rutan-Ram because they are Jews,” Alex J. Luchenitser, associate vice president and associate legal director at Americans United, said in a news release.</p>
<p>“Public funds should never be used for religious discrimination,” Luchenitser told Knox News. “The law should never create obstacles that keep loving parents from taking care of children who need a home. That should certainly never occur because of religious discrimination.”</p></blockquote>
<p>End all religious exemptions in the law, please. They are going to be abused by the biggest dumb-asses in the country.</p>

    <title>Richest man in the world is a talking ass</title>

    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="lead">I read that Elon Musk is currently the richest man in the world, which is as complete an indictment of capitalism as could imagine. Whenever he opens his mouth he exposes his ignorance, yet people still think he’s saying something worthwhile. He’s just a guy with an undeserved mountain of money that he uses to buy stuff, nothing more, and it’s a shame that his follies haven’t caught up with him yet, if ever — money seems to be a pretty effective cushion against the consequences of your actions.</p>
<p>A few years ago, he bought a <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/04/21/neuralink-and-the-delusional-world-of-muskians/">company called Neuralink</a>, which was supposedly working on brain-machine interfaces, but is actually <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2019/09/26/neuralink-is-99-hype/">99% hype</a>, and put an <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/04/09/who-is-max-hodak/">unqualified tech bro</a> in charge. The <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/04/24/more-criticism-of-neuralink/">real neuroscientists</a> could tell the whole idea was a load of overstuffed bullshit, but the media stumbled all over itself in a rush to give him more press.</p>
<p>You would think that someone — the investors, the journalists, the people hoping for medical breakthroughs — would notice the similarities between Elon Musk and Elizabeth Holmes, especially since the Holmes trial just wrapped up with a conviction, but noooo.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/holmes-musk.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/holmes-musk.png" alt="" width="486" height="196" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65370" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/holmes-musk.png 486w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/holmes-musk-150x60.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/holmes-musk-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px"/></a></p>
<p>Now Neuralink is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/20/elon-musk-brain-chip-firm-neuralink-lines-up-clinical-trials-in-humans">looking to find human guinea pigs for his overhyped technology</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Silicon Valley company, which has already successfully implanted artificial intelligence microchips in the brains of a macaque monkey named Pager and a pig named Gertrude, is now recruiting for a “clinical trial director” to run tests of the technology in humans.</p>
<p>“As the clinical trial director, you’ll work closely with some of the most innovative doctors and top engineers, as well as working with Neuralink’s first clinical trial participants,” the advert for the role in Fremont, California, says. “You will lead and help build the team responsible for enabling Neuralink’s clinical research activities and developing the regulatory interactions that come with a fast-paced and ever-evolving environment.”</p>
<p>Musk, the world’s richest person with an estimated $256bn fortune, said last month he was cautiously optimistic that the implants could allow tetraplegic people to walk.</p>
<p>“We hope to have this in our first humans, which will be people that have severe spinal cord injuries like tetraplegics, quadriplegics, next year, pending FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval,” he told the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council summit.</p>
<p>“I think we have a chance with Neuralink to restore full-body functionality to someone who has a spinal cord injury. Neuralink’s working well in monkeys, and we’re actually doing just a lot of testing and just confirming that it’s very safe and reliable and the Neuralink device can be removed safely.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He is nowhere near that capability. He is lying. I know that here in America no one is going to care about the victims of irresponsible experimentation, but I would hope that someone would give a loving, concerned thought to the investors who are being taken to the cleaners by this fraud. Hope is not data. Appealing to the suffering victims of tragedy is one of the oldest tricks in the con artist’s toolbox.</p>
<p>That’s not all. <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/top-quotes-elon-musk-neuralink-2020/">Someone has confused science-fiction novels with reality</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Musk said that he thinks in the future we will be able to save and replay memories. “I mean this is obviously sounding increasingly like a black mirror episode but yeah essentially if you have a whole brain interface everything that’s encoded in memory you could you could upload you could basically store your memories as a backup and restore the memories then ultimately you could potentially download them into a new body or into a robot body the future is going to be weird one!” said Musk.</p></blockquote>
<p>A “whole brain interface” — what’s that? How are you going to do that? You think you can skim off the totality of a person’s experience with a little chip you can pop on and off? Where are memories encoded so you can extract them? How are you planning to overwrite a brain’s structure and chemistry and connectivity so you can replace one brain’s identity with another?</p>
<p>I don’t think he’s going to have much luck hiring someone to oversee human experimentation in these areas, since Josef Mengele is dead. He’ll probably just hire some tech-dude with no qualifications and no sense of ethics — I hear those guys are sprouting up all over Silicon Valley.</p>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Austrian writer Thomas Bernhard (Everett Collection Inc / Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/hd01jh.jpg" height="595" alt="Thomas Bernhard" width="864" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Books are frequently given and received as prescriptions: this one enlightens, that one cheers you up. Readers expect books to assist them in some way: to educate them, perhaps, or to deepen the moral sense. The books of the Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard might be recommended as prescriptions too. Only they function as purgatives.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Bernhard, who died in 1989, is famous for the bleakness of his outlook. From his first novel, &lt;em&gt;Frost&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1963, to &lt;em&gt;Extinction&lt;/em&gt; (1986), the novelist and playwright developed a distinctive style and mode of cultural critique. His works draw attention to, and then revel in, the unremitting cruelty of human relations and the pretentious futility of cultural life. It is through this effect that they achieve their purgative function, inviting us to cast out all our attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s novels are now available in English translation and readers have been purging themselves with them for some time. They have been joined at last by &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt;, one of his shortest. For years it was hard to come by, having long been out of print in its previous translation. Now issued in a new translation by Douglas Robertson, it has been published by Spurl Editions, a California-based press who describe themselves as specialists &amp;ldquo;in works fitting for our current decrepit and apocalyptic world&amp;rdquo;. &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt; has clearly found a good home.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Much of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s ire was directed against his own native Austria and was designed to make uncomfortable reading in that context. In his books, Vienna is a hateful place to live, representing the death of culture, along with the annihilation of art and intellect. Bernhard attacked Austria relentlessly as a country that he believed remained, following the end of the war, dominated by the twin spectres of Catholicism and National Socialism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is tempting to read Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s work biographically: this is the outlook of a man who was born illegitimately and whose father rejected him, who was schooled first by Catholic priests and then by Nazis (in his autobiography, he described school as &amp;ldquo;a machine for the mutilation of my mind&amp;rdquo;). Suffering from a chronic lung condition, he lived as a young adult among invalids, enduring botched medical interventions and the care of Catholic nuns. It is easy to see him as a tortured man, trapped in an ailing body, living with a death sentence and looking resentfully at the world around him. But this would do him an injustice. The themes in his work may be dark, but there is the sense that Bernhard is always there, in the background, laughing heartily at what he attacks. And besides, many of the themes covered in his work can be extended elsewhere. What makes Bernhard so persistently disturbing is that the world he depicts in his novels is often still recognisable, more than three decades after his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recurrent theme is that of intellectual obsession. Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s obsessed intellectuals are great procrastinators. They have an epoch-making study in mind but never get down to writing it. Their commitment makes them ruthless to themselves and others, and because that work is never accomplished, there can be no possible justification for the pain it has produced.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A project of this type appears in &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt;, where Koller, the main protagonist, spends the entire novel attempting to write his &lt;em&gt;Physiognomy&lt;/em&gt;, a great work in which important observations regarding the imprint of world history and nature and personal experience will be revealed through the study of facial features. The cohort for this study are the &amp;ldquo;cheap-eaters&amp;rdquo;, a group of men who for years have sat at the same table in the Vienna Public Kitchen, ordering the cheapest meal available. The intellectual challenge Koller has set himself is considerable. In order to bring his study to completion, he must hold the &amp;ldquo;entirety of nature and the entirety of the science of nature in his mind&amp;rdquo;. This simply cannot be done, and so Koller sets himself up to fail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Confronted by the inanity of everything ever written'&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another important theme in Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s work is the destruction of research subjects by their investigator, most brutally rendered in &lt;em&gt;The Lime Works&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1970. A claustrophobic masterpiece, the novel follows the scholar Konrad and his disabled wife Zryd as they imprison themselves in an abandoned lime works near the Austrian town of Sicking. Konrad has them live there so that he can have the space, and peace, to begin writing his masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;The Sense of Hearing&lt;/em&gt;. He submits his wife to his obsession with hearing, attempting to teach her to hear tiny variations in a phrase he mutters in her ear, each day, until she collapses with exhaustion. His lesson, which is also his experiment, ultimately fails, and eventually he ends it with a bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt; is interesting for subverting this trend. Koller studies his subjects but does not cause them pain or discomfort. However much he inspects them, they go on eating easily alongside one another. Furthermore, when he first arrives at the Vienna Public Kitchen, Koller finds that they do not subject him to the intrusive inspection that he normally receives as soon as his prosthetic leg is noted. They do not confront him, as Bernhard writes, with &amp;ldquo;that common, squalid, and repulsive sort&amp;rdquo; of look &amp;ldquo;with which people like him are otherwise universally and incessantly confronted and to which they are exposed and subjected in the most vulgar and shameless fashion&amp;rdquo;. This does not mean that the cheap-eaters do not inspect him at all. Actually, they submit him to a &amp;ldquo;thorough and by no means squeamish inspection&amp;rdquo; as he eats. They see him clearly, but they do not judge his &amp;ldquo;crippled condition&amp;rdquo; or ask him to justify his existence, nor do they extend him any sympathy. They merely assist Koller as he attempts to take his seat. This suits Koller&amp;rsquo;s purposes perfectly, since his &lt;em&gt;Physiognomy &lt;/em&gt;relies upon a similar gaze: an inspection of surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One character in &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt;, Goldschmidt &amp;ndash; a bookdealer &amp;ndash; presents an interesting mini-case study of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s wider argument against the intellect. Committed to his work with books, he is also as a result confronted by &amp;ldquo;all the abominableness and brutishness of human history&amp;rdquo; that is contained within them. The bookdealer who takes books seriously &amp;ldquo;is the most pitiable person in the entire human race&amp;rdquo;, Bernhard writes, &amp;ldquo;because day after day and uninterruptedly he is confronted by the absolute inanity of everything ever written and more than any other person he experiences the world as a version of hell&amp;rdquo;. Language is itself irredeemable, from Goldschmidt&amp;rsquo;s perspective. According to what Goldschmidt tells Koller, language consists &amp;ldquo;of words of equal weight&amp;rdquo; by which thoughts are &amp;ldquo;incessantly weighed down and crushed&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;Against language, against intellectual culture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are intriguing claims: against language, against books, against intellectual culture. But as with his other novels, logical argument is not the vehicle of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s purging. Rather, through a reiteration and restatement of these claims, his writing offers its own peculiar respite. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Koller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Physiognomy &lt;/em&gt;is never written, of course, and &lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt; remains first and foremost an account of intellectual failure. Koller is an interesting example of Bernhard&amp;rsquo;s destroyed and destroying intellectual. Separated from others, existing superficially alongside his peers, he pursues his intellectual project with such diligent singlemindedness that he is unable to relate to other human beings. It is tempting to conclude that he cannot complete his Physiognomy because to study others, to speak of the human condition, is to account for the world intellectually. To do that is already to distort the world he perceives and to alienate himself from it.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cheap-Eaters&lt;/em&gt; is a magnificently annihilating little book. It presents an opportunity within the space of reading to become distant from the promises of intellectual culture that are made ever more insistently as they are betrayed. With Bernhard, the pleasure is in the purge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Arresting artwork</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5913/arresting-artwork#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Zahid Mayo&amp;rsquo;s portrait of a young girl holding a sheet over her naked body (Courtesey of ArtSoch)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/_Y7A5884v.jpg" height="418" alt="Painting of a girl in Pakistan" width="627" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a late June evening in Lahore, critics, creatives and prospective art buyers rushed to attend the launch of Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s newest contemporary gallery. ArtSoch, in the heart of Gulberg, one of the city&amp;rsquo;s busiest commercial areas, promises to support emerging artists and breathe new life into the country&amp;rsquo;s art scene. It was packed with visitors and a steady stream of reporters. They weren&amp;rsquo;t disappointed. While most of the walls were hung with more traditional work referencing local architecture and beautiful landscapes, one piece stood out, in large part because, for the first half of the launch, it was flipped over, facing the wall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pakistani audiences tend to shy away from controversial topics, and the gallery owners must have been unsure what the public reaction would be. Halfway through the launch, however, the painting was finally revealed. It caused a stir. Zahid Mayo&amp;rsquo;s oil portrait on canvas of a young girl holding a sheet over her naked body would have raised a lot of questions on its own. But the accompanying text in Urdu calligraphy made it the talking point of the launch. It asked: &amp;ldquo;Meray Nange Jism Se Tumhe Kya Masla?&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Why do you have a problem with my naked body?&amp;rdquo;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s conservative and patriarchal norms have long dictated acceptable topics. But the country has also been grappling with a rising feminist movement over the last decade &amp;ndash; one that has, since 2017, been fed by the global #MeToo movement. Women&amp;rsquo;s access to public spaces is still restricted: a recent study found that 70 per cent of males would discourage their female family members from taking public transport, while riding a bike is still taboo. But society&amp;rsquo;s policing of women&amp;rsquo;s bodies is increasingly being questioned. Every year since 2018, the countrywide Aurat (Women&amp;rsquo;s) March has been held, despite critics within both the media and government accusing marchers of going against Pakistani &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; and spreading vulgarity. This intensified after a poster with the slogan &amp;ldquo;Mera Jism Meri Marzi&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;My Body My Choice&amp;rdquo;) went viral in 2015, sparking death threats against the organisers and efforts to ban the march.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this context, placing a semi-nude figure in public is a statement in itself. But as a painting in a gallery, it also drew attention to the pressure placed on women to preserve their bodies away from the eyes of predatory men, rather than the onus being on the men themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Art for social change&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For too long, Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s art scene has lacked both public interest and state support, as well as financial stability. A few established names continue to dominate. Avoiding politics, they stick to aesthetics. Houses are adorned with beautiful paintings with common traditional themes: horses, buildings, landscapes and calligraphy. Co-founder and curator of ArtSoch, Mariam Hanif Khan hopes that the new spaces opening up in Pakistan can draw new and passionate voices to the scene. &amp;ldquo;Our gallery is about mobilising young people because nowadays the younger generation rarely pursue visual arts,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;We want to promote an idea that art is not just visually appealing but has a much deeper meaning.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is likely to be a gradual process, building on work already being done. Karachi&amp;rsquo;s Canvas gallery has been exhibiting thought-provoking contemporary work since 1999. Its founder, Sameera Raja, was an architect before moving into the art world in the hopes of changing what it was that Pakistani society considered to be art. &amp;ldquo;The work we do primarily focuses on building an awareness around art and for that we have to build bridges,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;What good art should do in my opinion is that it should plant a seed in your mind, and that seed doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to flower immediately, because maybe you&amp;rsquo;re ready for it 10 years later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process requires creating spaces that are both safe and engaging. Artists, curators and gallery owners find themselves treading a fine line between creating meaningful, urgent work and being too literal. Finding this balance can lead them to explore social change in unexpected ways. Raja points to Canvas gallery&amp;rsquo;s recent exhibition of Saba Khan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Water Explorer&amp;rdquo;, which showed in August and September. Saba&amp;rsquo;s work centred on the Indus river and the way its water is used. &amp;ldquo;In a way it was pushing boundaries of the conversations we have around water,&amp;rdquo; Raja said, &amp;ldquo;and how the end user is a woman, because it is women who collect water in rural areas and yet they have no say in the larger scheme, in regulatory bodies and committees in Pakistan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Freedom of speech under threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some conversations are easier than others. Noormah Jamal is a Pashtun artist, part of a marginalised ethnic group from the north of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Having grown up in the majority-Pashtun city of Peshawar, Jamal later moved to Lahore to study at the National College of Arts, and was shocked to find how many of her peers were sheltered from knowledge of the ethnic divides that dominate Pakistani society. While Pashtun and other minority activists have been working hard to raise awareness around their mistreatment, the forced disappearance of activists and silencing of their voices by the state, she discovered that their fight is rarely discussed outside their own regions. Jamal decided to do her thesis on gender, race and personal bias, and to confront these issues in her art, which explores identity and emotion through portraiture and sculpture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamal&amp;rsquo;s latest major work is a sculpture series of women in burqas. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve always seen burqas be portrayed as a form of oppression,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Where I grew up in Peshawar, chadars and, later, colourful burqas were a big part of our culture.&amp;rdquo; Many women wore these burqas after the influx of Afghan refugees in the 90s who had fled the first Taliban regime. Her series explores her own childlike fascination with the colourful garments and aims to put out a counter-narrative to that which emphasises the black, Saudi-inspired abaya as an oppressive tool for Muslim women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamal, too, is treading a fine line. She points to the controversy around Adeela Suleman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Killing Fields of Karachi&amp;rdquo;. The installation of tombstone-like sculptures, highlighted by red flowers placed upon the &amp;ldquo;graves&amp;rdquo;, called attention to extra-judicial killings in Karachi at the hands of the police, who the artist believed were also unfairly targeting Pashtuns. It was shown at the 2019 Karachi Biennale for less than half an hour before police removed it. But those 30 minutes made a difference, says Jamal. &amp;ldquo;I feel that even in ransacking [removing the art] it got justice as after that so many people who previously had paid no attention to work like mine, which focused on minorities, were now suddenly asking me about it.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While change will not be immediate, the creation of engaging artwork can help facilitate a dialogue that has long been suppressed. Privately owned galleries give artists a certain freedom away from the hand of the state, yet the growing number of public galleries in Pakistan allow for a different kind of conversation, and for different kinds of art that are not simply made to be sold on the market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crucially, this comes at a time when freedom of speech is under real threat. In September, thousands of journalists protested a bill that, if passed, could shut down media organisations and penalise journalists for &amp;ldquo;defaming&amp;rdquo; military generals, judges and government leaders. Pakistan already ranks near the bottom of global freedom indexes. While artists are censored by the state, and use symbolism to protect themselves, the growth of a larger art world in Pakistan can help push back against this trend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite courting controversy with his portrait of an empowered naked woman, Zahid Mayo&amp;rsquo;s work continues to be exhibited across Pakistan. A definitive change is sweeping through the art world, in the face of dangers and limitations. As Mayo said in a recent interview for the Express Tribune: &amp;ldquo;I think many times the process of art creation in public spaces, and how it has the power to involve people, is much more important than the art itself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>How to build an animal</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5911/how-to-build-an-animal#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="(Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/forbes.jpg" height="589" width="805" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Legend has it that, on the morning of 28 February 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick blew into the Eagle pub in Cambridge proclaiming to the regulars and the world, &amp;ldquo;We have discovered the Secret of Life.&amp;rdquo; They weren&amp;rsquo;t crazy &amp;ndash; the molecular biologists had discovered the structure of DNA, which instantly suggested, as their paper in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; would put it a few months later, &amp;ldquo;a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DNA molecule, they proposed, was a very long double helix: two strands intertwined like a twisted ladder, with the bases linking up as the rungs holding the strands together. This molecule could reproduce itself by unzipping the two strands and adding the complementary bases to make two new double helixes identical to the original. They had discovered, in outline, how living things manage to reproduce themselves so faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1960s, there was further revelation: we discovered that the bases also constituted another code. This provided the blueprint for the production of the very many proteins that do all the major work in our living cells. Today, every one of the 3 billion bases in human DNA has been fully sequenced. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we&amp;rsquo;ve cracked the Secret of Life. Understanding that it is DNA that transmits the hereditary information and makes proteins was a great breakthrough. But a puzzle remained: for all the insight we have gained into the reproduction of genetic material, it still didn&amp;rsquo;t answer a fundamental question, one that has dogged scientists for centuries: how is an animal built? In other words, once the design is in place, how does the construction happen? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We might think of a symphony, where the DNA constitutes the score. The symphony of life &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;endless forms most beautiful&amp;rdquo; in Darwin&amp;rsquo;s words &amp;ndash; is created from this DNA code or sequence, this &amp;ldquo;score&amp;rdquo;. You can reproduce a Beethoven symphony by photocopying the score, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you how musical instruments and human hands and brains work to turn the notes into living music. What instructs a human, for example, to grow its arms and legs and fingers and toes &amp;ndash; all derived originally from a single cell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extract from the 2005 poem &amp;ldquo;The Spirit Is Too Blunt an Instrument&amp;rdquo; by Anne Stevenson tells us how it&amp;rsquo;s not done:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spirit is too blunt an instrument&lt;br /&gt;to have made this baby.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing so unskilful as human passions&lt;br /&gt;could have managed the intricate&lt;br /&gt;exacting particulars &amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some great principle of biological engineering does create &amp;ldquo;intricate exacting particulars&amp;rdquo;. Clearly, it&amp;rsquo;s not achieved by the human spirit, God or abracadabra. Rather, as we&amp;rsquo;ll see, it is governed by particular protein products of the DNA: a class of chemical agent known as a morphogen, a generator of form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The fundamental &amp;ldquo;bricks&amp;rdquo; of life&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand how morphogens work we need to start with the fundamental &amp;ldquo;bricks&amp;rdquo; of life: the cells. Living things can only develop by means of cells dividing into two and then two again, and so forth. To learn how to build an animal, we therefore need to investigate the properties of these &amp;ldquo;bricks&amp;rdquo;. Biochemically and physiologically, there are many different kinds of cell, but they all look more or less the same. The biochemist Nick Lane puts it like this: &amp;ldquo;I challenge you to look at one of your own cells down a microscope and distinguish it from the cells of a mushroom. They are practically identical.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that we always start from a single living cell, let&amp;rsquo;s pose what seems a manageable question: how do animals acquire four limbs and their attached appendages? We have already shown how DNA can be imagined as a score, a blueprint or a building plan. Without such a plan, dividing cells would simply produce a constantly expanding ball. Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s not what happens. Cells divide more in one direction than another, breaking the symmetry of what would otherwise be a sphere, and creating the shape of the animal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most basic plan for an animal is a trunk with four limbs. All living things have to eat, and, unlike some primitive bacteria that can live off mere raw chemicals, animals have to eat other preformed creatures. Some tiny creatures are just a sausage-tube with a front and back: the front is the end that ingests the food; the end is where waste is expelled. But bigger animals need appendages, which eventually appeared in evolution as fins, arms, legs and wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the next schematic stage for our animal is for limbs to grow off that trunk. All the higher animals &amp;ndash; such as amphibians, reptiles, birds, marsupials and mammals &amp;ndash; have four limbs. Why is that so? Because they evolved from fish, which have just two front and two hind-fins. In birds and bats, two of these limbs became wings. In most of the rest, the four limbs all effectively function as legs. In humans, two of them became arms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this building process work? A few months before Watson and Crick burst into the Eagle, another great thinker made a discovery that would give us our first clue. Alan Turing &amp;ndash; mathematician, Enigma code-breaker and inventor of the concept of the digital computer &amp;ndash; made a contribution to the Secret of Life that is only now receiving its due recognition. Turing showed theoretically how spreading zones of migrating chemicals could create coloured patterns on the coats of animals, whether they be spots or stripes. They had shape-generating properties, and he called them &amp;ldquo;morphogens&amp;rdquo;. Eat your heart out, Kipling and his &lt;em&gt;Just So&lt;/em&gt; story &amp;ldquo;How the Leopard Got His Spots&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scope of morphogens has expanded dramatically since Turing&amp;rsquo;s pioneering work. They are now understood to help create not only two-dimensional patterns but also three-dimensional forms, such as arms and legs and their terminal digits. They do this by diffusing through developing cells, instructing them to change their character as they go, gradually building the appropriate kinds of cells for each part of the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Making our heads, arms and legs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the late 1960s, a related idea was taken up by the inspirational embryologist Lewis Wolpert, who died in January 2021 aged 91. Wolpert was an imaginative thinker, a great team leader and a vigorous populariser of science in books like &lt;em&gt;The Unnatural Nature of Science&lt;/em&gt; (2000). Wolpert suggested the theory that morphogens, as they made their way from their source, diffusing through a growing mass of cells, caused different effects as they travelled further away and their concentration weakened. Near to the source they have one effect; further away a different one. Wolpert called this the &amp;ldquo;French Flag model&amp;rdquo;: one could imagine a &amp;ldquo;French Flag&amp;rdquo; animal that was red at one end, white in the middle and blue at the other end, all produced by the same morphogen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1980s, genes with a related pattern-forming purpose, the hox genes, came into detailed focus, thanks to advances in gene sequencing and manipulation. The protein products of hox genes are &amp;ldquo;super morphogens&amp;rdquo;, specifying the overall body plans of all animals, most significantly the head and the trunk. These super morphogens specify the room plan of the house, if you like, while the morphogens go to work in choosing the kind of cooker, fridge and sink, and decide where they should go in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early 20th century, we had our first inkling of what happens when a super morphogen goes wrong: fruit flies were found with organs growing on the wrong part of the body &amp;ndash; a leg where an antenna should be, or vice versa. Something that told a leg or antenna where to form was malfunctioning. Now we know that something is a hox gene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the super morphogen hox genes specify where the shoulder and pelvic girdle start and then another morphogen comes into play. In 1993, the whimsically named morphogen &amp;ldquo;sonic hedgehog&amp;rdquo; (named on account of its relation to the so-called &amp;ldquo;hedgehog genes&amp;rdquo; that produce bristles on flies) was discovered to control the structure-forming gradients in many parts of the body: how wide apart our eyes are, for example; how the limbs develop from those buds off the main trunk, and how many fingers and toes we have. The latter, for example, shows the French Flag model in action, creating a gradient from thumb (&amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo;), through middle fingers (&amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo;) to pinkie (&amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The function of sonic hedgehog can be seen most clearly in cases where it has been disabled. This happened in Utah in 1957, when sheep were born with a Cyclopean single eye and other deformities. The culprit, identified 10 years later, was a chemical called cyclopamine, found in the plant &lt;em&gt;Veratrum californicum&lt;/em&gt;, which the sheep were eating. Drought had driven them to higher pastures where the plant was growing. In the 1980s, cyclopamine was shown to block sonic hedgehog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We saw an equivalent case in humans with the drug thalidomide. Widely prescribed to pregnant women in Europe between 1957 and 1961 as a treatment for nausea, the drug interfered with the working of sonic hedgehog. Before thalidomide was withdrawn, it caused all manner of birth defects, including hands that grew from the shoulders. But even in normal development, sonic hedgehog sometimes gets it wrong: people with six or seven digits occur in one out of 700-1000 live births.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;"Just a very large clitoris"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If morphogens and hox genes can seem a bit abstract, the way that nature sculpts an animal comes vividly into focus when we get to the business end: the genitals. &amp;ldquo;La diff&amp;eacute;rence&amp;rdquo; maybe, but in developmental terms the male and female genitals are really all of a piece, woven from the same tissue. Only very small changes at the molecular level distinguish the male testosterone from the female oestrogen. It&amp;rsquo;s quite hard to spot the difference unless you&amp;rsquo;re a chemist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the developing foetus, it is the sex hormones, acting as morphogens, that build either the female or male genitalia from the same original tissues. In the early embryo, the primordial organs, so far undifferentiated, become male or female depending on the signal from one or other of the so-similar hormones. Once development has finished, switching hormones can accentuate or diminish secondary sexual characteristics but they cannot reverse the plumbing. That requires surgery. So it&amp;rsquo;s either labia or scrotum, clitoris or penis, ovaries or testes (which are formed in the male in the same place in the stomach as the ovaries but which then descend into the scrotal sac). The default is the female form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that animal forms can only be produced by cells dividing and moving in one direction rather than another. So the scrotal sac is just a large hollow version of the labia, with a sealed seam where the vagina would be. Indeed, the whole appendage of which males are so proud is just a very large clitoris with the urethra diverted down the middle, and a connection to the testes and the prostate gland. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingenious plasticity of most of these processes is highlighted by the bizarre case of the spotted hyena, which gives birth through the clitoris. How evolution succeeded with this apparently grotesquely malformed plumbing is a mystery. Birth this way is hard: 60 per cent of the firstborn hyenas and 9 per cent of their mothers die at birth. It sounds like a challenge to Darwin, but despite its extreme reproductive strategy, the spotted hyena is an abundant, successful species. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The growth of an animal is a cascade: once it gets going, it can&amp;rsquo;t stop. But it can go wrong. Timing and positioning are a large part of the developmental process. Because many processes can only be turned on at the correct time in development, a wrong turn early on cannot later be made good. The reason that thalidomide wreaked such deadly and lasting damage is that the sonic hedgehog morphogen is busy patterning the limbs during weeks five and six of gestation, when the pregnant mothers were taking the drug. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as there is no one Secret of Life, many processes are brought to bear to hone and fine-tune the actions of morphogens like sonic hedgehog. Building an animal is a concerted job between the genes, the protein-signalling morphogens, the different kinds of cells they produce and the messenger molecules on their surfaces. There is a powerful analogy with language here. The linguist Guy Deutscher, in &lt;em&gt;The Unfolding of Language&lt;/em&gt; (2005), shows how language evolved its complexity by a process akin to biological evolution: &amp;ldquo;Languages have&amp;hellip; developed a range of&amp;hellip; techniques to help make the bricks stick, such as the use of various adhesives which facilitate the construction of much more complex edifices.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;From a single egg to the finished animal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our knowledge of how to build an animal is still very broad-brush. Recent work, reported in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine, sheds new light on the fine-tuning of the construction technique. Working with zebrafish, scientists have found that sonic hedgehog patterning is actually a bit sloppy, but that it interacts with and is fine-tuned by interactions with the proteins that stick cells together. These cell adhesion proteins also specify cell types and they make sure that the broad pattern laid down by sonic hedgehog, at least most of the time, produces the correct result. In the zebrafish experiment, they were found to produce the 13 pre-patterning &amp;ldquo;stripes&amp;rdquo; that parcel out the early spinal cord &amp;ndash; not only in zebrafish, but in all vertebrates. In humans they also ensure, most of the time, that we have 20 tiny fingers and 20 tiny toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the successful completion of the Human Genome Project, the international mission to map and understand our DNA, was announced at a White House press conference in 2000, President Clinton told the world that &amp;ldquo;Today we are learning the language in which God created life.&amp;rdquo; He said that the genome was the &amp;ldquo;book of life&amp;rdquo; which we could now decode &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;the most wondrous map ever produced by humankind&amp;rdquo;. In fact, the genome was only 83 per cent complete at the time. But even if it had been fully complete, as it is now, Clinton would have been jumping the gun. DNA is only one piece of the puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DNA sequence of any organism&amp;rsquo;s total complement of genes, the genome, is fundamental, but how it functions at different stages in the development &amp;ndash; from a single egg to the finished animal &amp;ndash; is intricately subtle. This article has covered a few prime examples of this. They were mostly surprises; many unknown unknowns still await us on this quest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So where do we find the Secret of Life? It turns out that there isn&amp;rsquo;t one. In evolving life&amp;rsquo;s complexity over four billion years, many processes have been deployed. Let&amp;rsquo;s call them &amp;ldquo;secrets&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ndash; although a growing number aren&amp;rsquo;t secrets any more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"&gt; &lt;div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"&gt; &lt;div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: The Wordhord</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5910/book-review-the-wordhord#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-_9_.jpg" height="515" alt="image" width="689" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wordhord: Daily Life in Old English&lt;/strong&gt; (Profile Books) by Hana Videen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does the &amp;ldquo;Old English&amp;rdquo; language really deserve the name? Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s old &amp;ndash; it was spoken in some form between the 6th and 12th centuries &amp;ndash; and sure, it&amp;rsquo;s the ancestor of the English we speak today. It was certainly spoken in England and the etymological link between the names of the Englisc and English language is also clear enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet to presume that the English we speak today is simply an updated version of the English spoken in the early mediaeval period risks obscuring the otherness of Old English. In fact, this Germanic language was transformed by contact with the Romance language of Norman French after 1066, creating the unique hybrid that we know today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wordhord&amp;rdquo; is an actual term from Old English literature. Heroes like Beowulf are said to &amp;ldquo;onleac&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;unlock&amp;rdquo;) their precious hoard of words on speaking at weighty, important occasions. Hana Videen&amp;rsquo;s book grew out of her tweeting an Old English word every day and there is an app accompanying &lt;em&gt;The Wordhord&lt;/em&gt; that allows users to browse selected treasures from her hoard of words. Her &amp;ldquo;hord-wynn&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;hoard-joy&amp;rdquo;) in sharing her precious treasures is infectious. But the book is more than just a list of words. She turns them into the story of how Old English speakers saw the world and what mattered to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes our Old English ancestors seem familiar, sometimes not. We encounter numerous &amp;ldquo;false friends&amp;rdquo; that do not lead us where we think we are going: &amp;ldquo;Drēam&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;joy&amp;rdquo;, and a &amp;ldquo;bēd-hūs&amp;rdquo; is a place of worship, not a dormitory. Where old and new align, the older might be more expansive: a &amp;ldquo;lēac&amp;rdquo; could be any plant, not just a leek, while a &amp;ldquo;dēor&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t only a deer but can be any animal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surviving Old English wordhord is modest in size. There are only 200 partially or wholly Old English manuscripts, the majority dating from the 10th and 11th centuries and containing some 3.5 million words. That means scholars like Videen are faced with numerous words or compounds that are only known from a single instance in a single manuscript. These do, however, include numerous suggestive compounds that are all the more precious for their uniqueness: &amp;ldquo;symbel-gāl&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;feast-lustful&amp;rdquo;, whereby one is so satiated from the pleasures of food and drink that they cannot focus on the state of their soul; or &amp;ldquo;ān-stapa&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;one-stepper&amp;rdquo;, a person who walks alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is compounds like this that are the most exciting finds in the book, particularly when they take the form of kennings. Kennings combine two ordinary nouns to create metaphors rich in allusive power. They range from the comic to the gnomic, including &amp;ldquo;bān-loca&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;bone-locker&amp;rdquo;, or body), &amp;ldquo;fisces be&amp;thorn;&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;fish&amp;rsquo;s bath&amp;rdquo;, or sea) and &amp;ldquo;gongle-wǣfre&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;walking weaver&amp;rdquo;, or spider).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Old English word-making&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But while Videen&amp;rsquo;s book allows us to appreciate the expressiveness and creativity of Old English word-making and literature, she largely avoids confronting the reader with a major source of Old English otherness. Languages are not simply wordhords, they require grammatical scaffolding. And it is grammatically that the impact of Norman French on English is seen most dramatically. Like other Germanic languages, Old English was an inflected language in which nouns and other words were marked by case &amp;ndash; suffixes that indicate the syntactical function of the word (in modern English, prepositions like &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;by&amp;rdquo; perform this function). The collision between Germanic and Romance largely swept cases away. When today&amp;rsquo;s native English speaker tries to learn Icelandic, German, Finnish &amp;ndash; or, for that matter, Old English &amp;ndash; it is the case system that provides one of the first challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Videen does not claim her book is a guide to Old English. Rather, as she states, it is for her a source of the &amp;ldquo;wynn-drēam&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; intense and visceral joy &amp;ndash; that comes from both connecting with the Old English-speaking past and mining that past to find new ways of expressing things that humans have always felt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Burning the witch</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5909/burning-the-witch#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="A former pastor holds the skull of his wife, who was accused of sorcery in central Papua New Guinea and killed by axe (Anton Lutz) " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/skull.jpg" height="734" width="1071" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;By the time his father died in his childhood home in Papua New Guinea, Father Benedict (not his real name) had been a Jesuit priest for decades. News of the death travelled from the Carterets &amp;ndash; a chain of beautiful coral atolls &amp;ndash; to Bougainville, one of the main islands, where Father Benedict lives in a small community nestled in the lush tropical forests. Soon after, one of his relatives had a dream in which he said it was &amp;ldquo;revealed&amp;rdquo; that sorcery had been responsible for the death. Later, more &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; supporting this was found in the rainforest &amp;ndash; a local youth had been caught engaging in what appeared to be ritual practices. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Father Benedict&amp;rsquo;s family members urged him to take action against the youth accused of having worked the sorcery, despite a hospital certificate stating that cancer was the cause. Consumed by grief, Father Benedict hesitated, struggling with real doubts as to what, or who, was to blame for his father&amp;rsquo;s death, and how to respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the Witchcraft and Human Rights Information Network, there have been over 20,000 victims of accusations of witchcraft and related harmful practices over the last decade, spread across 60 countries. The research, published in November 2020, includes reports of over 5,250 murders, 60 disappearances in suspicious circumstances, and 14,700 attempted killings and physical attacks. While Papua New Guinea suffers disproportionately from the phenomenon, many parts of Africa and India also have high rates. Wealthier countries in the west are affected too. In 2019 the number of children known to have been abused in England as a result of beliefs in witchcraft and possession was reported to have risen by a third in two years, with almost 2,000 identified victims.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And this may be only the tip of the iceberg. Irrespective of where it takes place, these crimes are often hidden due to ignorance, shame and stigma, making comprehensive figures extremely difficult to generate. Emerging data, however, paint a disturbing picture of an ongoing, widespread and systemic form of violence that takes many different forms, depending on the part of the world. Alongside murders and physical attacks, there are also cases of grave desecrations and human trafficking. Women trafficked for witchcraft purposes are often silenced through being forced to take a ritual oath. They believe that breaking the oath by, for example, alerting the police will subject them and their families to revenge from the spirit world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In July, the significance of this complex and global issue was finally officially recognised in an historical resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council. The UNHRC emphatically condemned harmful practices related to accusations of witchcraft and ritual attacks that result in human rights violations. Will the phenomenon finally garner the attention needed to tackle it on the ground? How can we help stop sorcery accusation-related violence &amp;ndash; or SARV, as it is often called?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;The fear and violence of witchcraft accusations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m part of a research team working to tackle SARV in Papua New Guinea. We estimate that, nationally, six people are killed every month, and a further 23 suffer serious harm, including permanent injury. Our team comprises academics from the PNG National Research Institute and the Divine Word University in Madang, working with a network of local activists. We are a disparate group, including film makers, gender specialists and Catholic priests. It&amp;rsquo;s important for us to work alongside people of the Catholic faith, as this is the largest religious group in Papua New Guinea, comprising roughly 26 per cent of the population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our investigation has documented systemic and ongoing fear, violence and death resulting from accusations of sorcery in the country. Almost every accusation leads to ongoing shame and stigma and increased likelihood of future accusations. In almost a third of the cases documented it has led to physical violence or property damage. This violence is often very public. It involves acts of torture, such as burning with heated machetes, that are often carried out over many days, if not weeks, and that literally take place within the public square. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve sat in boats and on the back of trucks and under trees hearing people&amp;rsquo;s stories about the impact these accusations have had on their lives. Heartbreakingly, one survivor demanded I tell her the secret to removing the &amp;ldquo;stain&amp;rdquo; of a sorcery accusation that followed her everywhere. Another silently showed me her scars with tears rolling down her cheeks. Many victims either cannot access support services or choose not to go to the police or hospital for fear of further reprisals. Impunity for these offences is widespread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet accusations do not always have to lead to violent incidents. Let&amp;rsquo;s return for a moment to Father Benedict. When he heard the &amp;ldquo;evidence&amp;rdquo; of sorcery, he was thrown into doubt. After three days of prayer, he readied his mind and returned home to the Carterets. It was no easy journey to these islands, which are slowly sinking under the rising seas, requiring many transitions in and out of small boats. In many ways, his spiritual journey was even more arduous. &amp;ldquo;There was hatred and revenge from the members of our community, and pressure from them [to take revenge for his father&amp;rsquo;s death],&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Early on, I was very angry too [about the possibility of sorcery] but I prayed about it and thought about what was the best way to settle it in a peaceful way, and I let time pass.&amp;rdquo; &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;After much reflection, Father Benedict publicly refuted the claims that the death was caused by sorcery, and buried his father with full Catholic rites. Drawing upon his spiritual leadership, he worked with the local chiefs and village court magistrates to reconcile with the youth who had been accused, blessing water as a symbol of cleansing from both sides, and ritually shaking hands. Violence was averted, relationships restored, amity returned to this small atoll chain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Mutating like a virus&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;What can be done to help ensure more cases of sorcery accusation end in peace and reconciliation? A first step must be greater understanding. For example, the primary victims of witch-hunts are often assumed to be marginalised women, while there are in fact many classes of victim. In Papua New Guinea, women and girls are the main victims in the Highlands, while males are more likely to be accused in Bougainville. In some areas, it will be the &amp;ldquo;poisenman&amp;rdquo; who casts his sorcery through sprinkling substances into discarded hair or fingernails, while in others a &amp;ldquo;sanguma&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;witch&amp;rdquo;) woman is known to &amp;ldquo;eat&amp;rdquo; the heart of her victim. Like a virus, these narratives mutate to adapt to new conditions, as demonstrated in the growing number of stories of &amp;ldquo;sanguma&amp;rdquo; using mobile phones. While the poor and marginalised are often targeted, so are economic or political elites. Witchcraft accusations can be a very effective tool of the powerless, given the difficulty of mounting a defence against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What explains the prevalence of this trend in some places but not others? As would be expected, a major factor is the presence of a supernatural worldview, but this is by no means a complete explanation. In Vanuatu, a Melanesian archipelago where I used to live and work, sorcery would often be framed as an explanation for everything from unceasing rain to failures of court cases, but these apprehensions very rarely became personalised or violent. Socio-economic factors, including poverty, precarity, new forms of inequality and lack of trust in leaders and institutions, usually play a significant role.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Education in western science is of undoubted importance, but it must be understood as only one part of the solution. Our research with university students in Papua New Guinea supports psychological studies that identify the prevalence of what we term &amp;ldquo;worldview pluralism&amp;rdquo;. While many people understand the world principally through a frame based on scientific, religious or magical principles, it is also common for a number of these frames to coexist in a single individual. Even highly educated members of society do not completely replace one understanding of causality with another. They co-exist, with one emerging as dominant in a given context. In the case of Father Benedict, we saw him tussling with competing causal frameworks dictating different courses of action &amp;ndash; a dilemma he finally resolved in favour of a peaceful approach rooted in his Catholic beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our research found that one of the most effective strategies to divert accusations from turning violent was to raise doubt about whether sorcery had been used in that particular case. We call this a &amp;ldquo;doubt-based advocacy strategy&amp;rdquo;. Rather than seeking to convince others to reject a particular explanatory framework outright, the aim is to create or extenuate doubt about questions of causality.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Highlighting the potential negative consequences is another feature of this approach. One inspiring youth leader &amp;ndash; a local man who has worked as a recorder on our research project &amp;ndash; explained how he exercised leadership when his father died. His main motivation was to avoid the family and community fracturing that he had often seen following such accusations. &amp;ldquo;Even though I have a cultural belief in sorcery, I still can make decisions not to go down that road,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;My brother and his family were pushing me to do something, but I stood strong on my principles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often those best placed to nudge others away from dangerous stories about sorcery are people from within the group who may themselves have once had an ambivalent relationship to such narratives. These people can provide a bridge between different worldviews, through being an insider and &amp;ldquo;one of us&amp;rdquo;. It overcomes the familiar pushback: &amp;ldquo;Oh, but you just do not know about &lt;span class="s1"&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; sorcerers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Confronting sorcery accusations&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;The good news is that the phenomenon is garnering more attention, not only in Papua New Guinea but worldwide. One important step in facilitating such conversations is creating physical spaces in which they can be had, and developing terminology to frame them. In Papua New Guinea the term &amp;ldquo;sorcery accusation-related violence&amp;rdquo; has gained traction since 2013, following concerted attempts to mainstream the terminology by a network of officials, civil society and faith-based organisations. The UN Independent Expert on persons with albinism has spearheaded development of the terminology &amp;ldquo;harmful practices related to accusations of witchcraft and ritual attacks&amp;rdquo;. People with albinism have long been targets for those seeking to use their body parts in a range of ritual practices to overcome everything from male impotency to poverty, and know a thing or two about the dangers such beliefs can create.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This terminology seeks to emphasise the &amp;ldquo;harmful practices&amp;rdquo; rather than the beliefs themselves, recognising that in many contexts witchcraft and associated beliefs are valued by the majority of the population, particularly in regard to their use in traditional healing. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to share these views to acknowledge their importance when working with particular communities. Here in the United Kingdom, the term &amp;ldquo;child abuse linked to faith or belief&amp;rdquo; has been developed and awareness is being raised around the issue.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Greater understanding of how to confront sorcery accusations and related violence is not only important in its own right. Frequently characterised by mob justice, competing understandings of causation of events, as well as high levels of fear and uncertainty, our insights into how to deal with this issue can help us develop strategies for tackling many different forms of violence across the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are my main takeaways from my years of research in this field? The most positive finding has been that when accusations are made, community leaders, family members and faith leaders often step in to intervene. They create spaces for dialogue, for airing different perspectives and for calming the panic and anger. A path is found through previously polarised positions. While ending impunity for those who commit violence is important, it is the exercise of leadership in families, communities and national government that is probably our best hope of advancing a non-violent future. This means creating spaces for respectful dialogue and encouraging communities to arrive at peaceful compromise. &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As Father Benedict observed: &amp;ldquo;I came to an understanding that life has to continue. If they [the accusations] do not end they will continue to traumatise me. Because we are being imprisoned by what others think and what we think also . . . and so we just have to be flexible, let go and rest peacefully."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!&lt;/p&gt;

<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
