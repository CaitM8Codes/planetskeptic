&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Tucker Carlson is a sucker. Here he is promoting &amp;#8220;infrared therapy&amp;#8221;, or testicle tanning, which basically means shining red lights on your scrotum to supposedly increase your testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In his new special on how to raise testosterone levels in men, Tucker Carlson‚Äôs guest suggests ‚Äútesticle tanning‚Äù using infrared light as a ‚Äúbromeopathic‚Äù therapy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/PirerBMRyr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PirerBMRyr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ron Filipkowski &lt;img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f1fa-1f1e6.png" alt="üá∫üá¶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /&gt; (@RonFilipkowski) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1515817464533291018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanning is induced by UV light &amp;#8212; that is, high energy, short-wavelength light. Red or infrared light is weak or low energy, long wavelength light. It&amp;#8217;s going to gently warm your balls, and that&amp;#8217;s about it. Warming is going to actually reduce your sperm count, demonstrated here by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6476971/"&gt;the effects of a sauna&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semen was collected at weekly intervals for 3 wk before and 10 wk after the sauna exposure at 85 degrees C for 20 minutes. The numbers, morphology, ultrastructure, motility, viability and metabolism of the sperm was assessed. Sperm numbers fell within one wk and slowly returned to normal in 5 wk. The earliest ultrastructural change was swelling of the plasma membrane, followed by an increase in the number of immature forms and disorganization of the arrangement of the mitochondria. Motility, glucose utilization and lactic acid accumulation of the sperm rose temporarily immediately after sauna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little glowing red light might have a slight warming effect (hey, maybe it feels nice!), but I doubt that it&amp;#8217;ll do much at all for your testosterone levels. Besides, testosterone levels in normal, healthy men varies widely with no detectable effect &amp;#8212; extremes can have serious effect. This is just another example of the right wing&amp;#8217;s bizarre obsession with the trappings of masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what the wealthy trust-fund goon is promoting now in a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I promise you are not prepared for Tucker&amp;#39;s latest montage &lt;a href="https://t.co/8tdvYTW2cn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8tdvYTW2cn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; nikki mccann ram√≠rez (@NikkiMcR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiMcR/status/1515130557675581442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh. It&amp;#8217;s pushing that bogus &lt;a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/02/03/not-hard/"&gt;&amp;#8220;hard times create hard men&amp;#8221; bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. Just what I&amp;#8217;d expect from a fascist wanna-be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Room at the Inn: Inside the UK's asylum seeker hotel scheme</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5948/room-at-the-inn-inside-the-uks-asylum-seeker-hotel-scheme#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Syrian refugees in London after they arrived from Calais via the &amp;ldquo;Safe Passage&amp;rdquo; legal route (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-03-at-16.13.31.jpg" height="856" alt="asylum seekers" width="1330" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;On a warm afternoon last July, Ahmed went back in time. He and I exited the train at Hoylake, a middle-class seaside town near Liverpool, and walked past a Holiday Inn. The hotel had been his makeshift home for several weeks during the pandemic. With its smooth white walls, the building looked so generic it was hard to believe it contained such strong memories for the 26-year-old. But we weren&amp;rsquo;t stopping there, and instead continued on to a small red-brick church: the one place he&amp;rsquo;d felt truly accepted since leaving Sudan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahmed was wearing a denim jacket and a beaming smile as he entered the church courtyard to greet his fellow asylum seekers &amp;ndash; former residents of the hotel &amp;ndash; and the volunteers who had helped them. &amp;ldquo;Beautiful boy! How are you?&amp;rdquo; one of the volunteers asked him as we arrived at the reunion. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m very well, everything is good, it&amp;rsquo;s good to see you after a long time!&amp;rdquo; he replied.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A total of 110 asylum seekers lived in Hoylake Holiday Inn between May 2020 and February 2021. There were trained doctors desperate to work during the pandemic, teachers unable to teach, teenagers hoping for a better start, civil servants, police officers, farmers, journalists, accountants, architects, artists &amp;ndash; even a beekeeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demand for hotels had dropped hugely during the pandemic, just as the asylum application system ground to a halt, meaning more accommodation was needed. Converting them into temporary housing for asylum seekers took advantage of this. There was also a public health rationale. The strategy was put in place to create &amp;ldquo;a safe environment to greatly reduce the spread of Covid-19,&amp;rdquo; in the words of Mears, a company who received a lucrative 10-year contract to run asylum accommodation in 2019.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the summer of 2020, empty corridors and cobwebbed lobbies, abandoned by hotel guests, were once again full of people. Asylum seekers housed in hotel rooms climbed from 1,200 in March 2020 to 9,500 in October 2020, despite overall numbers of asylum applications to the UK falling significantly during the pandemic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy Vesey remembers the day they came to town. In May 2020, around two months after Covid-19 hit Britain, she saw a coach hulking through the locked-down streets of Hoylake. Vesey, who runs the charity A Heart 4 Refugees, discovered soon after that 46 asylum seekers had been placed in the Holiday Inn, directed by the private company Serco. There was no notice. The town had never hosted refugees before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vesey visited straightaway. She discovered they were all single men, many of them clearly suffering from PTSD. Several came straight from the Channel crossing, their T-shirts torn and dirty. Within 24 hours Vesey was soliciting clothing donations. And the food was dreadful. Muslims were served ham and pineapple pizza. &amp;ldquo;It was an own goal, really,&amp;rdquo; Jonny Brennan, a local pastor, told me. At lightning speed Vesey and a team of volunteers, including Brennan, organised a daily drop-in centre at Hoylake&amp;rsquo;s little red-brick church. They helped organise English lessons, signposted legal advice, and provided company and listening ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite some activities, and relationships forged between the walls of the hotel and the church, days at the Holiday Inn seemed to slow down time. Most asylum seekers are not allowed to work while their applications are being processed. The pandemic worsened this situation, with lockdown bringing about hotel curfews across the UK. People requesting asylum sat in their rooms, churning memories of harrowing experiences. &amp;ldquo;It exacerbates their poor mental health,&amp;rdquo; Vesey said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the reunion, Ahmed and others ate food, drank coffee and laughed about the hotel&amp;rsquo;s dire cooking. Everybody there had since moved on from &amp;ldquo;contingency&amp;rdquo; accommodation, like hotels, to &amp;ldquo;dispersed&amp;rdquo; housing scattered across the UK. Asylum seekers are given no choice over where they go and single people are often placed in flats with strangers. Even so, this feels to many like a step towards a more permanent home of their own.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But when it comes to gaining refugee status and the right to remain, progress seems to stall. The majority of former residents at the Hoylake Holiday Inn are yet to have their asylum assessment, Vesey said, even though many arrived in the country over a year ago. There are 67,547 people in the queue for assessment in the UK and over 125,000 waiting for a decision or to be deported. Waiting can feel like its own kind of punishment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Hotels became "detention-like facilities" for asylum seekers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;Asylum seekers had been housed in hotels as early as September 2019, albeit in small numbers. The Home Office had awarded Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contracts (AASC) to three providers: Mears, Clearsprings and Serco. But the strategy only hit the news when the seriousness of the Covid-19 virus caused it to be rapidly scaled up. It quickly began attracting headlines for the wrong reasons.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In September, a study by Edinburgh Napier University found that thousands of asylum seekers had been housed in hotels that were often &amp;ldquo;detention-like facilities&amp;rdquo;. Far from the safe environment that was promised, the investigation found that hotels were hotbeds for the virus, which often circulated during crowded mealtimes. This was just one of a litany of woes experienced by people requesting asylum: haphazard safety protocols, crumbling buildings, miscommunication with staff and sometimes just 15 minutes&amp;rsquo; notice when moving facilities for good. One woman was threatened with deportation, the study found, for refusing to throw her belongings away ahead of a transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key criticism was a detention-style lack of freedom &amp;ndash; doors locked shut at 8pm, allowance abolished. The Home Office previously provided asylum seekers with a &amp;pound;39.63-a-week allowance, but for those moved into hotels, this was scrapped, the reasoning being that hotel inhabitants already had their meals provided. Frustration bubbled over. The glare of the media spotlight followed gruesome events, like a suicide and a stabbing in Glasgow in 2020, and then faded away.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Then came the far right. A video of a Britain First agitator outside Hoylake&amp;rsquo;s Holiday Inn circulated on right-wing Telegram chats. &amp;ldquo;Are you waiting for a house?&amp;rdquo; a man demands through a window. Only two days before, the same group had stormed Daresbury Park Hotel in Cheshire, livestreaming themselves banging on bedroom doors.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s something which captures the imagination of the far right &amp;ndash; boats crossing the Channel, the White Cliffs of Dover &amp;ndash; and taps into all these notions of historical invasion,&amp;rdquo; Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at anti-fascist organisation Hope Not Hate, told me. The most dangerous part for Mulhall, though, is not the small-scale digital far right, but high-profile politicians who plaster hatred on YouTube or TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Hoylake in August 2020 as part of his &amp;ldquo;Farage Investigates&amp;rdquo; series, a so-called &amp;ldquo;exposing&amp;rdquo; of the hotel accommodation system that was viewed by millions. Before long the issue appeared on the BBC and Sky. &amp;ldquo;Nigel Farage is the key figure here,&amp;rdquo; Mulhall added. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s always been a useful bridge&amp;rdquo; between the niche far right and the centre right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the hotel&amp;rsquo;s residents were terrified. Khalid, a kind and optimistic 33-year-old from Sudan who was trafficked across Libya during the war in 2014, was one of them. &amp;ldquo;We felt unsafe,&amp;rdquo; he said. He had hoped the feeling of insecurity wouldn&amp;rsquo;t follow him to the UK.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hoylake&amp;rsquo;s locals, meanwhile, appear to have been largely empathetic. A September 2020 protest by another far-right group, For Britain, drew only a meagre crowd, with Vesey saying most of them were out-of-towners. A patient and conciliatory mediator, she offered to speak to anyone in town who thought the asylum seekers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Treacherous crossings and the Nationality and Borders Bill&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;But despite its many problems, for asylum seekers like Ahmed, Hoylake proved a sanctuary. Compared to the grime, fear and hunger that characterised his three months in the Calais &amp;ldquo;Jungle&amp;rdquo;, and his torturous life in Libya beforehand, he told me that having a bed, toilet, new clothes and supportive volunteers meant that &amp;ldquo;suddenly, your dreams changed within a few minutes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ahmed had worked as a barber. He recovered from polio as a child and walks with a permanent limp. Arriving in Calais, a people-smuggler offered him a deal: cut my hair for three months, and you&amp;rsquo;ll cross at a discount. &amp;ldquo;I thought this guy was playing a game with me,&amp;rdquo; Ahmed said. Nevertheless, he started to cut the man&amp;rsquo;s hair. One day, on seeing his bad leg, an Iraqi man took pity on him and gave him 100 euros. The smuggler was satisfied with the fee. He instructed Ahmed to go to the beach at 9pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One glance at the waves and two of the 12 people who had gathered to cross fled. The remainder inflated the engine-propelled dinghy. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid to die in the Channel,&amp;rdquo; Ahmed recalls thinking as they launched into the cold dark water. &amp;ldquo;At least it&amp;rsquo;s better than to live so badly.&amp;rdquo; The Dover Strait is the world&amp;rsquo;s busiest naval highway. Ships plumped up big swells that lapped over the edges of the rubber vessel, causing panic. &amp;ldquo;Some of them start crying, some of us start praying,&amp;rdquo; Ahmed said. The men dug out saltwater shoe by shoe until, just after dawn broke, a British Border Force vessel rescued them and dragged the boat to Dover port.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ahmed&amp;rsquo;s is a typical journey for asylum seekers in the UK. More than 28,000 people made the treacherous crossing last year, the most ever. &amp;ldquo;The reason why that&amp;rsquo;s happening is because there are no safe and legal routes to enter the UK to claim asylum,&amp;rdquo; Julia Savage, campaigns manager at north-west England charity, Asylum Matters, told me.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Vesey and organisations like Amnesty fear new legislation planned by the UK government will make future Channel crossings even more dangerous. The Nationality and Borders Bill has been criticised by charities, who say it will further criminalise refugees. Under the bill, people arriving by &amp;ldquo;irregular means&amp;rdquo; such as small boats will be granted fewer rights and face greater chance of deportation. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said it will &amp;ldquo;break the business model&amp;rdquo; of people-trafficking gangs across the Dover Strait and help clear the long backlog of asylum applications. But the UN said it would &amp;ldquo;penalise most refugees&amp;rdquo; and break international law.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;We consider it an anti-refugee bill,&amp;rdquo; said Savage. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t crack down on the mafia by punishing the extorted.&amp;rdquo; She worries that rather than opening safer routes for asylum, the new legislation will lead to more incidents like the horrific, and preventable, drowning of 27 people in the Channel on 24 November 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="p4"&gt;Operation Oak and "moving on"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;In February last year, as lockdowns eased, Operation Oak kicked up a gear. This was the name given to the Home Office&amp;rsquo;s push to move all asylum seekers out of temporary contingency hotel accommodation and into dispersed accommodation by the end of 2021; here they would await their so-called &amp;ldquo;substantive interview&amp;rdquo;, in which the case for asylum is made &amp;ndash; a process one minister said was designed to take place &amp;ldquo;as quickly as possible&amp;rdquo;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But Operation Oak faltered. The number of asylum seekers living in hotels rose to around 25,000 in January, up from 1,200 in March 2020, when the pandemic hit.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hoylake Holiday Inn now operates as a regular business again. Guests would never know their room may once have belonged to a refugee. But a new, more permanent asylum hotel was opened nearby by the Home Office last autumn, so Vesey and her band of 36 volunteers are still kept busy supporting the asylum seekers and pushing for better conditions. The High Court in 2020 ordered the Home Office to review its abolishment of the &amp;pound;39.63 allowance for hotel inhabitants. They are now paid &amp;pound;8 a week, which still doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover their basic daily needs.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;If someone wants to buy a toothbrush, they can&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; Taulant Guma, who oversaw Edinburgh Napier&amp;rsquo;s project, told me. If they complain, they&amp;rsquo;re often threatened with deportation. This is how the UK&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;hostile environment&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; system works, Guma said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahmed now lives in a north-western city in England, in a shared house with other asylum seekers. As he&amp;rsquo;s no longer housed in a hotel, he said, his allowance has been raised back up to &amp;pound;39-a-week. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not much but it&amp;rsquo;s great!&amp;rdquo; he told me. Yet 19 months after arriving he had still not had his substantive interview. Meanwhile, he misses his family. His younger brothers and sister, small children when he left, still live at home in Sudan. He calls regularly but the signal is bad. &amp;ldquo;Last time I spoke to them their voices were telling me, like&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; He paused in sadness. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re growing up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ahmed waits, fighting away depression and traumatic memories from Libya and France, he thinks fondly of his time in Hoylake and the help of Vesey and other volunteers. &amp;ldquo;Kathy owns all their hearts,&amp;rdquo; Ahmed said. In this way, Vesey managed to bubble-wrap the corners of the hostile environment. She has weathered her own traumas, as a breast cancer survivor, said Clint Agard of Wirral Change. &amp;ldquo;She won&amp;rsquo;t let people go down. That&amp;rsquo;s what drives Kathy, keeping people&amp;rsquo;s spirits up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A small number of Hoylake&amp;rsquo;s guests have been luckier than Ahmed. Mohammed, 39, was granted refugee status in January last year. He stayed at the Holiday Inn for almost three months. Now he lives alone in a social housing flat in the north-west, studying English at college and volunteering for a frontline charity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mohammed left a government job in Algeria and fled to England in 2019, after he was arrested for being gay. When the Home Office granted him refugee status, Mohammed felt a feeling wash over him &amp;ldquo;of freedom and living as me without restrictions or fear of anyone&amp;rdquo;. He dreams of moving to London, to live near friends and the LGBT scene. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not happy 100 per cent,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;but I&amp;rsquo;m good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;In dispersed housing in London, Khalid keeps himself busy. Days he spends improving his English, evenings he runs or cooks in his temporary flat. An Arsenal fan, on Sundays he guards the defensive line playing football. But trapped in an uncertain, workless limbo familiar to all asylum seekers, most of his hours are spent waiting for his Home Office substantive interview, just as he has been waiting now for well over a year.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The last time I spoke to Khalid, he&amp;rsquo;d just dipped into his weekly allowance to buy pasta, bread and beans for a leaving party. Four days before, after an elongated wait, a friend had ripped open a letter from the Home Office telling him he was moving facilities by the weekend. It was time to say goodbye. The feeling in the room, he said, was not quite sadness. In a transient life, farewells are curt. &amp;ldquo;You make a friend somewhere, you spend good time with them, then they change to other friends,&amp;rdquo; Khalid told me. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re used to that.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps there will be a reunion, like Hoylake&amp;rsquo;s, down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But by now, Khalid knows the rhythms of asylum liminality. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m here, but tomorrow I could get transferred to another place,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t make any plans for tomorrow. You just wait.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

How COVID-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy&lt;/a&gt;" (Goldsmiths Press), authored by Davies, Sahil Jai Dutta, Nick Taylor and Martina Tazzioli, was published in March.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book, which you wrote together with colleagues from the Goldsmiths Political Economy Research Centre, makes clear that Covid has given greater clarity to several striking and uncomfortable truths about the workings of the British state and its economy: the central role played by a &amp;ldquo;shadow state&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;contract rentiers&amp;rdquo;; the shape and geography of inequality here. You&amp;rsquo;ve studied political economy and statecraft for decades. What, if anything, has struck you as especially remarkable over the past two years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One thing that&amp;rsquo;s been astonishing is that an economy that had long been organised around housing, as a driver of inequality, a focal point of macroeconomic policy and a cultural obsession, was able to become even more so, to the point where one now has to recognise that houses and households are the pivotal institution of British capitalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean this in a number of ways. Firstly, Covid-19 saw yet more house price inflation internationally, caused by the asset-purchasing programmes of central banks and a stamp duty holiday in the UK. But, by virtue of the injunction to &amp;ldquo;stay home&amp;rdquo; and the rapid expansion of digital platforms over the previous decade, "home" became a place of work, education, consumption, entertainment and retail. It also hugely intensified certain political dynamics of households, in terms of where financial surpluses and deficits occurred, and crucially where surpluses and deficits of time in the household occurred. In financial terms, this is evident in how certain households built up huge savings over the course of lockdowns, seeing as their opportunities to spend suddenly disappeared, whereas others fell more deeply into debt. But the issue of time was also significant: certain people (those furloughed, without children or caring responsibilities) found themselves with unprecedented levels of free time, to bake bread or watch Netflix, whereas others were under intense pressure to juggle responsibilities arising from home-schooling and home-working. Evidence shows graduate mothers were doing more work in the evenings and at night than any other demographic. None of these processes is entirely new, but they have been ramped up even further over the last two years. What we don&amp;rsquo;t know is what the longer-term legacies of (what we term in the book) &amp;ldquo;hyper-domestication&amp;rdquo; will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the UK &amp;ndash; both the government and the public &amp;ndash; responded as you would have expected?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Nobody knew what a policy response to such an event would look like, though one could have guessed that central bank asset-purchasing would be part of the mix, as so many economies in the Global North were already addicted to these policies. Beyond this, however, the last two years has been an astonishing revelation of what governments are actually capable of. Firstly, there is the use of their own balance sheets to borrow and spend, without raising the cost of borrowing, something that was deemed impossible for the previous decade. This paid for the furlough scheme, something that was also unimaginable only a few weeks before it was unveiled, but could now reshape how we think about welfare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there were the various local interventions. The Everyone In scheme, which initially aimed to get 5,000 people off the streets, but had by May 2021 moved 37,500 people into Covid-secure housing. The designation of &amp;lsquo;essential worker&amp;rsquo; status (for instance in terms of whether an employee&amp;rsquo;s child was offered a school-place) demonstrated that it is possible for policy-makers to distinguish social value, something that neoliberal intellectuals have spent a century denying. Even in schools, where things were very tough for teachers, they acquired a level of autonomy and demonstrated a service to local communities that teachers and unions have long argued for, but which have always been dismissed by central government and the press. In all these ways, the unthinkable became thinkable. &lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it about the particular nature of the pandemic itself, as opposed to other crises, that lent it what you describe as a &amp;ldquo;photosynthetic&amp;rdquo; function, &amp;ldquo;feeding tendencies that already existed, while also illuminating them&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This is a very interesting issue. We adopted the metaphor of "photosynthesis" because we recognised that the pandemic isn&amp;rsquo;t just an ordinary economic crisis. In many ways, it exacerbates tendencies that were already there (as in the example of the household economy and housing), but by virtue of it affecting everybody, had a powerful political effect in raising consciousness and visibility of these tendencies. Crises aren&amp;rsquo;t always like this. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was the biggest of its kind since the 1930s, and yet if you owned your own home, were retired, or employed in a senior position, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really hit you much. Thanks to policy choices, the costs were pushed towards the young, public sector workers, local government and those dependent on local government. The politics of the pre-Covid decade was shaped by these divergent experiences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Covid, some got rich out of it, many died, and nobody could entirely ignore it. It had a clarifying and politicising effect, the consequences of which I suspect we&amp;rsquo;ve not yet seen. The type of state, labour market, care infrastructure, society were unavoidable matters of concern, across ages, classes and geography. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One point the book makes early on, when discussing the cronyism in government around the awarding of Covid-related contracts, is that proximity to the British state &amp;ndash; if not the Conservative Party itself &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;now represents a business model&amp;rdquo;. Is this a marked change in the nature of government-to-business relations in the UK? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I think there were three things going on here. The first is that the British state has been a source of revenue for a whole industry &amp;ndash; public service outsourcing &amp;ndash; since the late 1980s. This has been well-documented by the likes of CRESC and Brett Christophers, who classifies &amp;ldquo;contract rentiers&amp;rdquo; as one of the major forms of rentiership at the heart of British capitalism. When a Minister has a major policy problem, you can count on two hands the possible consultancy firms and service providers who they will turn to to solve it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the post-Brexit Conservative Party and Johnson leadership is evidently far more relaxed about helping its donors and friends, from positions of power. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exaggerate the purity of British politics pre-Johnson, but we know that the state operates in a more clientelist way than it did only a few years ago, as is often associated with &amp;lsquo;populist&amp;rsquo; regimes. The third is that the emergency of Spring 2020 and onwards clearly deepened this tendency, as exhibited by the &amp;ldquo;VIP Lane&amp;rdquo; that was discovered through which Covid contracts were awarded without usual procurement procedures. So again, something &amp;ldquo;photo-synthetic&amp;rdquo; occurred, in that features of the British state that had become sedimented over the previous 30 years &amp;ndash; and others that were features of the past five years &amp;ndash; were suddenly thrown into the limelight, and amplified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also make the point that one of the great tragedies of the pandemic is the priority accorded to the nation and to national policy-making. Why is this to be lamented? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Because the pandemic is a singularly global event. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to conceive of anything that could have brought so many people, across so many national and cultural boundaries, into such simultaneity like this. That is a consequence of jet travel, and it is the first airborne pandemic since jet-based business travel and tourism engulfed the entire globe. That it has also occurred in the context of the internet and social media adds to the intensely global sensibility that it has generated, much as Benedict Anderson wrote of how &amp;ldquo;print capitalism&amp;rdquo; enabled the rise of nations in the 18th century, by bringing members of large territories into a single chronology of experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Responses would ideally be global as well, in terms of vaccination and protection of the vulnerable. Instead, we saw what Adam Tooze has described as an &amp;ldquo;Olympics of national governance&amp;rdquo;, in which each nation pursued its own distinctive path. I guess this had benefits from an experimental point of view, but it also saw drastic escalation of border controls, with dire consequences for refugees, and some frankly racist hierarchies of which nations were perceived to pose greatest risk to others. As Tooze has argued, none of this bodes well for the larger global crisis of climate breakdown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book notes the central role played by data and data platforms in critical decision-making processes around the Covid-19 response. How does this transform state power?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Data, in its 21st century digital form, has been crucial to pandemic responses in societies such as the UK. This is true for the somewhat botched track-and-trace system, in which the Covid-19 app, venue check-ins and ubiquitous QR codes became an attempt at rolling out surveillance. This was met with considerable hesitancy, made worse by anxieties surrounding the use of NHS data, meaning that the system never really delivered. In countries that experienced SARS, such as South Korea, such platform-based surveillance was far more advanced, with considerably greater state enforcement. Vaccine roll-out was enabled by data analytics provided by firms such as the controversial Palantir. Then there is the ongoing question about what access data and AI firms might attain as part of their services to the NHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These public-private partnerships are unlike many outsourcing contracts, as they grant private platforms and data analysts a form of sovereignty over us, not only in terms of surveillance, but in terms of making crucial decisions over our movements and freedoms. The geographer Louise Amoore has identified this in relation to electronic borders, operated by what she terms an &amp;ldquo;consultocracy&amp;rdquo;, that is, power and decisions in the hands of IT service providers. The capacity to sustain certain forms of movement and market, under exceptional conditions, is conditioned by the handing over of powers once unique to the state, into the hands of commercial data analysts. This is why companies like Palantir provoke such unease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The whole experience has polarised many over the question of public vs. state power. Anti-vaxxers and anti-mask wearers, often but not always rather &amp;ldquo;anti-state&amp;rdquo; in their orientation, are derided as selfish and self-sabotaging; those who comply with the rules are conversely seen as complicit in supporting a widening of state and para-state powers. Was there ever a safe middle line to tread between personal health and personal freedoms?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I think there was, but one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t become too seduced by hindsight. We can all look back on some of the excesses of lockdowns (closed playgrounds, bans on sitting down in parks) and wonder what the hell was anyone thinking. But there was intense fear at the time of something entirely novel. Nobody in a position of expertise was advising in favour of moderation, because the great fear was the situation witnessed in Lombardy, of hospitals completely overwhelmed. I think children&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing, education and longer-term prospects should have received far more attention and priority, but that reflects as much on warped generational priorities as anything else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As someone who was writing widely, long before the pandemic, on various manifestations of state overreach, how have you, in your own day-to-day life, grappled with this tension between accepting measures that are intended to protect public health &amp;ndash; mask wearing, handing over of high volumes of personal data, tighter border controls &amp;ndash; and relinquishing of personal freedoms? How have you thought this through and reasoned with its outcomes? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It's extremely difficult, because I have sufficient confidence in the scientists advising the government, and even sufficient confidence in many senior figures in the government, to accept that measures were introduced according to the best balance of evidence that they could come up with at the time. We know that measures were introduced too late in Britain in March 2020, and that had they been introduced sooner, then deaths would have been fewer and freedoms restored sooner, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different issue. We were broadly living in a very fallible utilitarian experiment, never conducted before, and I don&amp;rsquo;t believe anyone knew with very much confidence what was the best way to make trade-offs. In that sense of real-time decision-making, with a lot of &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo;, it did resemble a wartime scenario. Some measures, such as mask-wearing, became overloaded with moral symbolism on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to remain sceptical, without falling into traps of conspiracy theory. The difference between scepticism and cynicism is not always easy to maintain, but one thing that is always worth doing is identifying and calling out those who are themselves acting cynically and opportunistically, including politicians, businesses and other elites, who have exploited a collective tragedy for their own benefit. The Left was also guilty of this at times, arguing for things that resembled a &amp;ldquo;left-wing&amp;rdquo; agenda in certain respects (such as &amp;ldquo;zero Covid&amp;rdquo;) but which failed to acknowledge the facts of Britain&amp;rsquo;s situation. The claim that because the government is a Tory one, it actively wants to kill people, or that schools should never have opened until Covid had disappeared entirely, is not a useful way of understanding things in my view.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-07-at-14.27.52.jpg" height="843" alt="Rowson cartoon" width="1252" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In my early childhood days at a Catholic boarding school in Droitwich, there were some miraculous stories that had particular appeal. There was the wonderful one about Jesus feeding a multitude on five loaves and two fishes. And feeding them so well that, according to Mark, there was enough left over for 12 baskets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was the intriguing tale about how the Virgin Mary miraculously made her way into heaven. As the priest in charge of our daily Religious Instruction carefully explained, Mary couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply ascend to heaven in the same manner as Jesus because she was not actually divine. So instead of being forced like everyone else to go through the natural process of physical decay and death, she was bodily &amp;ldquo;assumed into heaven&amp;rdquo;. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the priests who took our RI lessons seemed willing or able to elaborate on the physics of this doctrine, but I remember my 10-year-old classmate, Rollason, suggesting one night in the dormitory that Mary must have been literally sucked up to heaven through the operation of something like a celestial vacuum cleaner. Whoosh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet none of these stories engaged my attention so firmly as the Catholic account of the vicissitudes of the soul, which, we were told, did not die with the flesh but was held in suspension until being reunited with the body at the final resurrection.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Souls, we learned, were rather special internal organs. They were all too readily contaminated and stained by sin, and these stains were so black and so deep that they could only be washed away by regular visits to the confessional. (This story gained some of its imaginative appeal from the manner in which it symbolically matched with the fate of a fellow pupil, Riley, who was banished from school because he had a potentially fatal spot on his lung.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All through those early childhood days the absolute cleanliness of my soul was of more immediate daily concern than other more evident bodily manifestations, such as the appearance of pubic hair and facial spots.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But keeping a soul clean was an arduous business. For although confession promised to sweep away one&amp;rsquo;s sins, a nasty sinful stain could reappear merely by the espousal of a single dirty thought. So while one could readily remove the big black stain left by masturbation with some post-confessional penance &amp;ndash; half-a-dozen Our Fathers and a few score Hail Marys was the usual tariff &amp;ndash; once out of the confessional box, even a brief pleasurable thrill at the erotic noise made by Matron&amp;rsquo;s nyloned legs as she patrolled the dormitory was enough to once again mar the purity of that ever-so-sensitive internal organ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;It was Freud, or at least my teenage acquaintance with Freudian psychology, that finally freed me from the tyranny of the constantly stained soul. The news came from Vienna that the real psychic battle was not between the cleanliness of one&amp;rsquo;s soul and the ever-present allure of immoral thoughts and deeds, but between the instinctual desires of the id, a moralising agent known as the ego, and a poor psychic entity, the super-ego, which endeavoured, like the horses of Plato&amp;rsquo;s chariot (Freud&amp;rsquo;s metaphor), to mediate between the other two contenders for control.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This was welcome news. No longer was I the unhappy host of an all-too-easily stained soul, but a more complex creature. It was a model of internal psychic life that not only relegated dirty thoughts and actions to the id, but, more importantly, allocated all one&amp;rsquo;s oppressive moralising concerns about such naughty matters to the self-righteousness of the super-ego.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We do bad things. We think bad thoughts. We thoroughly despise ourselves for both our bad thoughts and our bad actions. And there really is no psychic detergent that will clear up all these contradictions. They are constantly present.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My childhood priests, immersed in their doctrinal certainties, had no time for such complexities. Their detergent model of psychic life was without ambiguity, free from all internal contradiction. How could they have been so simple-minded? Freud asked himself the exact same question. &amp;ldquo;Why is it,&amp;rdquo; he wrote, &amp;ldquo;that none of all the pious ever discovered psychoanalysis? Why did it have to wait for a completely godless Jew?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Our Own Worst Enemy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5946/book-review-our-own-worst-enemy#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img title="Trump Supporter at Minneapolis Rally (Tony Webster / Flickr)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-03-at-14.44.19.jpg" height="898" alt="Trump voter" width="1330" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Blame for the populist irruptions which have beset many democracies in recent years has been widely distributed: bewildered observers have blamed bankers, politicians, academics, journalists, social media platforms &amp;ndash; apologies to anyone omitted. Most, however, have been reluctant to blame one fairly obvious cohort of culprits: voters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Nichols, a professor at the US Naval War College and contributor to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;USA Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and others, suffers no such squeamishness. Nichols is an old-school American conservative who believes that the responsibilities of a citizen are at least as important as their rights. His previous book, 2017&amp;rsquo;s tremendous &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Death of Expertise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was an indictment of the widespread abandonment of established knowledge in favour of quackery. His hugely entertaining (and vastly popular) Twitter feed often concerns itself with more prosaic manifestations of poor citizenship, notably slovenly deportment among aeroplane passengers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Our Own Worst Enemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; makes a persuasive case that all such symptoms have essentially the same cause: the wilful retreat, by a great many adult inhabitants of wealthy, safe and free countries, into a state of toddler-like fury at anything that contradicts, thwarts or upsets them. Trump&amp;rsquo;s victory in 2016 was the most obvious manifestation of this. A transcendentally ignorant, risibly unqualified blowhard and buffoon &amp;ndash; and arguably America&amp;rsquo;s worst unimprisoned citizen &amp;ndash; Trump presided over an administration of astonishing corruption and ineptitude. Last November, 74 million Americans declared that they wanted four more years of it. (Nichols, who was among those American conservatives who commendably denounced Trump, now believes that the entire Republican Party for which he once worked and voted requires urgent ushering into history&amp;rsquo;s dustbin.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The men who wrote the US constitution had a keen understanding of power&amp;rsquo;s corrosive effects, and therefore devised a means of distributing it so that nobody could have too much. But they also appreciated that institutions, however solid, will not maintain themselves. James Madison, who helped draft the constitution and later served as president, warned that &amp;ldquo;No theoretical checks &amp;ndash; no form of government can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.&amp;rdquo; John Adams, the second president, cautioned that &amp;ldquo;public virtue cannot exist in a nation without private virtue&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Nichols, it should be stressed, is not altogether a curmudgeonly Jeremiah, clad in a sandwich board, pronouncing imminent doom at irritated commuters. It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that he would agree entirely with H. L. Mencken&amp;rsquo;s assessment of Americans as &amp;ldquo;the most timorous, snivelling, poltroonish, ignominious mob of serfs and goose-steppers ever gathered under one flag in Christendom since the end of the Middle Ages&amp;rdquo;. Nor is he one of those tiresome posturing Spartans advocating the scouring moral benefits of warfare or other hardship. But &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Our Own Worst Enemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; does argue that the United States&amp;rsquo; prosperity &amp;ndash; unrivalled in human history &amp;ndash; has made a hefty and noisy sector of Americans if not soft, then soft in the head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;The opening chapter, &amp;ldquo;A Hunger For Apocalypse&amp;rdquo;, is an especially astute diagnosis of what currently ails America &amp;ndash; and given the contagion of American manias, much of the west. People burdened with troubles and obstacles relatively tiny when compared to most of today&amp;rsquo;s world, and certainly almost all of history, are determined to perceive themselves as brutally oppressed and perched on the edge of disaster. Variations on such fantasies substantially drove the votes for Trump, Brexit and other populist causes, and were certainly a catalyst for the rabble without a clue who ransacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;There is a temptation to assume that Trump&amp;rsquo;s failure to win re-election in 2020 signified a breaking of this lunatic fever. It did not. Whether or not Trump seeks, or wins, re-election in 2024 &amp;ndash; and neither eventuality is unlikely &amp;ndash; the self-indulgent rage he both emboldened and exemplified is still at large, and is all the more hazardous for its unmooring from reality. &amp;ldquo;The diminishing of threats and the elevation of expectations,&amp;rdquo; writes Nichols, &amp;ldquo;coupled with the dullness of daily life in a society gorged on more forms of leisure than it can comprehend, is both the triumph of liberal democracy and a danger to it.&amp;rdquo; The great service performed by &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Our Own Worst Enemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is to remind us just how clear, and how present, that danger remains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Explosions of brilliant light</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5945/explosions-of-brilliant-light#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Supernova__CGI_.jpg" height="547" alt="supernovae" width="720" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p1"&gt;To huge excitement, and with great anxiety, NASA&amp;rsquo;s James Webb Space Telescope launched into space on Christmas Day. At a cost of nearly $10 billion, it is the most expensive ever built. Yet for astronomers, its price is fully justified. The telescope will effectively be able to look back in time to the origins of the universe, shedding greater light on the earliest so-called &amp;ldquo;super-luminous supernovae&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; searingly bright stellar explosions that have only begun to be recorded in the past two decades.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It was in 1931 that Fritz Zwicky and Walter Baade of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who were researching &amp;ldquo;novae&amp;rdquo;, made the first claim about exploding stars that were bigger and more powerful than previously believed possible. Their study built on a discovery made eight years earlier by Edwin Hubble, who used the 2.5-metre Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson near Los Angeles to confirm that the mysterious &amp;ldquo;spiral nebulae&amp;rdquo; that scientists had been puzzling over since the 1850s were &amp;ldquo;galaxies&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; great islands of stars separate from our Milky Way and millions of light years away. Zwicky and Baade noticed that such galaxies sometimes hosted stellar explosions. Knowing these explosions were enormously far away yet still visible, the two astronomers concluded they belonged to a new class of &amp;ldquo;supernovae&amp;rdquo;, around 10 million times more luminous than standard novae.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;That turned out not to be the end of it. In 2005, scientists discovered the first &amp;ldquo;super-luminous supernova&amp;rdquo;, 100 times as powerful as the supernovae discovered by Zwicky and Baade. This was recognised as a distinct class of stellar explosion six years later. Astronomers were shocked. How could they possibly have missed the brightest ones?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;One reason super-luminous supernovae went unnoticed until the 21st century is that they account for only about one in every 10,000 supernovae. Another is that scientists searching for supernovae tended to concentrate on big galaxies, with astronomers reasoning that the more stars in a galaxy, the greater the chance there is of one going supernova. Nature, however, had other ideas: it put super-luminous supernovae in small, or &amp;ldquo;dwarf&amp;rdquo;, galaxies. Only with the advent of robotic telescopes with wide fields of view were dwarf galaxies caught in astronomers&amp;rsquo; nets. Suddenly, super-luminous supernovae started popping up. Around 100 have so far been discovered.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Not surprisingly, such cosmic mega-explosions occur only in very massive stars. The clue to what powers them may come from what happens in the lead-up to the explosion. The core of such a star actually implodes, shrinking catastrophically to form a super-compact object the size of Mount Everest but with a mass comparable to the Sun. Such a &amp;ldquo;neutron star&amp;rdquo; spins fast for the same reason an ice skater who pulls in her arms does: she conserves angular momentum. These stars can spin 1,000 times a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such an extraordinary flywheel has more than enough rotational energy to energise a super-luminous supernova, providing there is some way to transfer that energy to material exploding outwards. One such way is via an enormously strong magnetic field. And there is reason to believe such neutron stars can have a magnetic field between 100 billion and 100 trillion times as strong as a fridge magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it has taken almost two decades to find the first 100 super-luminous supernovae, the discovery rate will soon be boosted by the James Webb Space Telescope. With its 6.5-metre mirror, it will be able to detect super-luminous supernovae at greater distances and at earlier cosmic times. At the dawn of the universe, there were many more dwarf galaxies than today because they had not yet merged to form today&amp;rsquo;s giant galaxies. And there are theoretical reasons to believe that the first generation of stars to form after the Big Bang were monsters, possibly more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. Super-luminous supernovae could easily have been more common at the beginning of time.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This raises an interesting possibility: you are made of stardust. The iron in your blood, the calcium in your bones &amp;ndash; these elements were forged inside stars that lived and detonated before the Earth was born. They mingled with clouds of interstellar gas that later congealed to form the Sun and the Earth. Super-luminous supernovae could therefore have contributed a significant fraction of the elements in your body. In which case, there is no need to use a $10 billion telescope to see a piece of a super-luminous supernova. Just hold up your hand!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. &lt;a href="/subscribe"&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield‚Äôs amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield‚Äôs shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

Filled with Homer‚Äôs stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person‚Äôs choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children‚Äôs creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box. ¬†There is a ¬†need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children‚Äôs creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with ¬†Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually¬†&lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoD is back in business!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth?¬†Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday‚Äôs post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website¬†<em>is¬†</em>called¬†<em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing‚Äôs perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn‚Äôt this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don‚Äôt think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he‚Äôs probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn‚Äôt even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we‚Äôve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won‚Äôt provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here.¬†<strong>Zero-hour¬†</strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered.¬†<strong>Zero-time¬†</strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people‚Äìartists in residence, politicians, captains of industry‚Äìalso get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be¬†<em>teaching¬†</em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday‚Äôs post were duties professors undertake¬†<em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don‚Äôt get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other ‚Äúintellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units‚Äù? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù is still a word with a meaning. Most people‚ÄìI dare say the vast majority of people‚Äìthink that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don‚Äôt¬†<em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don‚Äôt have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don‚Äôt appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That‚Äôs exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct ‚Äúprofessors‚Äù recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students‚Äìthey‚Äôd be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts‚Äô soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can‚Äôt afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it‚Äôs business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees‚ÄìI stopped counting‚Äìearn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a>¬†on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one‚Äôs area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn‚Äôt capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>¬∑ Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>¬∑ Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn‚Äôt yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don‚Äôt speak adminstratese, ‚Äúzero-time‚Äù means ‚Äúunpaid.‚Äù Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging¬†<em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs exactly the problem: things are already¬†<em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn‚Äôt even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but¬†<em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as ‚Äúservice to the discipline‚Äù and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this ‚Äúextra‚Äù work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs‚Äô ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don‚Äôt earn anything close to a living wage,¬†<em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it‚Äôs just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
