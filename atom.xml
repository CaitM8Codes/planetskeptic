<p class="lead">Editors seem to love to publish waffling centrist apologists for journalistic weaseling, and I hate it. Here’s some opinion columnist saying <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/22/cnn-joe-rogan-covid-ivermectin-mistake-credibility/"><q>The media slant on Joe Rogan and covid has been wrong. Journalists must do better.</q></a> He thinks journalism has been <em>too hard</em> on that hack.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>In my experience, a journalist who admits uncertainty and owns up to mistakes is ultimately more trusted, not less so. (Even opinion writers should be accountable to facts and alive to the unknowable.) </p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. So what misstatement of the facts did CNN make?</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>For this reason, CNN is wrong to double down on its smug reports that vaccine-skeptic podcaster Joe Rogan treated his coronavirus with “horse dewormer.” He did not, as nearly as I can determine. Rogan’s covid-19 was treated, he said, with a number of medicines, including the anti-parasite drug ivermectin — the same medication that former president Jimmy Carter’s foundation has used to fight the scourge of river blindness in Africa and Latin America. Like many drugs, ivermectin also has veterinary applications.</p></blockquote>
<p>CNN reported that Rogan had treated his infection with a cocktail of glop — antibodies and ivermectin and vitamins, and who knows what else. That is accurate. That’s what Rogan himself announced. He was dosing himself with an anti-parasitic drug to treat a virus. This is a problem, because it spreads the word that <em>maybe</em> taking random drugs is an effective way to handle a specific disease, and maybe this columnist hasn’t noticed, but there are people refusing to take the effective treatment because they’re doping themselves with horse dewormer or betadine. We did not mock Rogan enough.</p>
<p>Further, talking about river blindness is a dishonest distraction. It’s irrelevant. Did Joe Rogan have onchocerciasis? He had COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>So far, there isn’t a lot of evidence that ivermectin is a good anti-covid therapy, and federal agencies have warned people who hear about the drug not to consume a paste intended for livestock. But that doesn’t mean Rogan ate horse dewormer. You don’t fight disinformation with disinformation. Not if you’re a good reporter.</p></blockquote>
<p>A good reporter would explain that Rogan was misleading his audience by taking horse dewormer seriously as a treatment for a virus. They’d also mention that the evidence is in: ivermectin is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a good anti-COVID-19 therapy. </p>
<p>All we have here is a hack writing dodgy crap to sow doubt. Here he is talking about how the vaccines are “new” and might have “unforeseen effects”. </p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>CNN’s pundits might not have sneered at Rogan if he had toed the line on coronavirus vaccines — even if it is a line that is underinformed and overconfident. I yield to no one in my enthusiasm for these vaccines. They are wonderfully effective, and the speed of their development was a scientific triumph. However: The vaccines are new. There are unanswered questions about long-term effectiveness and potentially unforeseen effects. And even vaccinated people keep dying — albeit at much lower rates. It’s understandable that some — such as Rogan — will air doubts. CNN shouldn’t be stigmatizing their natural skepticism.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I learned from this is that David Von Drehle, the author, is a marginal crank and not a reasonable source (he got his start as a sports writer, and evolved into a political pundit — he has zero qualifications in science or medicine). I’ll remember that name.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reason #1: I’m off the prednisone and pain-killers, since the tendinitis agonies have now subsided greatly. I’m just stuck wearing The Boot to immobilize my left foot for a few weeks while everything presumably repairs itself. Good news, right? Except now I dread the return of the pain. Ask my wife about all the screaming and cussing that was going on last week.</li>
<li>Reason #2: Now my immune system is out of wack. With this round of drugs, I was immunosuppressed while teaching mobs of young men and women, and now I’ve developed a nasty hacking cough and sore throat. This is not good in a time of COVID-19. I should probably get tested soon.</li>
<li>Reason #3: Yesterday was meeting hell, and I’ve got the Zoomies now. On top of my classes, we had our annual tenure and promotion review meeting last night…for almost 3 hours. Three hours of pedantry and petty nit-picking. And that was after student seminar rehearsals. If my throat weren’t so sore I’d have been screaming.</li>
<li>Reason #4: We only got halfway through the list of promotion cases! We have to meet again tonight.</li>

    <title>Inside the new Space Race w/Nick Schmidle</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5876/inside-the-new-space-race-wnick-schmidle#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of hype of late over the 21st century "space race", which pits some of the world's richest men - Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos - against one another in a contest to see who will pioneer a new age of space adventure. But as Nick Schmidle, journalist and author of the recent &lt;em&gt;Test Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut&lt;/em&gt; discusses here, this is not just about space. There is machoism at play, and pressing questions over whose interests these men are serving: theirs and their wealthy customers, or humankind's at large?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A conversation about the marriage of extreme wealth and hubris, and what's next in "space tourism" and our exploration of the final frontier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosts: &lt;/strong&gt;Alice Bloch and Samira Shackle&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exec Producer: &lt;/strong&gt;Alice Bloch&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound Engineer: &lt;/strong&gt;David Crackles&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music: &lt;/strong&gt;Danosongs&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Image artwork: &lt;/strong&gt;Ed Dingli&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want access to more fresh thinking, why not subscribe to &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; magazine? Head to newhumanist.org.uk/subscribe and enter the code WITHREASON to get a whole year's subscription for just &amp;pound;13.50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niki Seth-Smith:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt;, coming to you from &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; magazine and The Rationalist Association. We're all about exploring matters of reason and unreason, criticism and debate, all through conversations with writers and thinkers about their work and ideas. I'm Niki Seth-Smith, and I'm Samira Shackle. Now on here, &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt;, we like to focus on philosophy, culture and science. And we mean &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; in the broadest sense. In this series, we've heard from anatomist Alice Roberts about the significance of human burials through the ages, we've heard from data scientist Pragya Agarwal discussing motherhood and choice, and the brilliant physicist Carlo Rovelli has talked rather poetically about quantum mechanics, truths and the humbling power of science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samira Shackle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that word &amp;ldquo;humble&amp;rdquo; probably isn't the first that comes to mind when you think about last year when Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Virgin&amp;rsquo;s Richard Branson made history within days of each other by travelling beyond the Earth's atmosphere on spacecraft that their own private companies had built. So a lot has been made of the spectacle of these men's egos knocking together. But Niki, your guest today knows the story and the context to it better than most of us do. He's the journalist Nick Schmidle, and for his latest book, he's taking a really close look at contemporary space travel. I'll be listening in to this one. So I'll let you tell us more about Nick and I'll be back with you later for a catch up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niki Seth-Smith:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks Samira. So, next, a journalist who writes for the likes of &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. And his first book was about his tumultuous years spent in Pakistan, so he clearly likes an adventure. In 2014, he started tracking the rise of Virgin Galactic. That's the American spaceflight company founded by Richard Branson and his British Virgin Group. His book, &lt;em&gt;Test Gods&lt;/em&gt;, looks at that story and more, taking us into the work and lives of the people fuelling the new space race. It's a tale of genius, lunacy and optimistic evangelism that's really only just begun. But it's also personal for Nick. His own father was a fighter pilot, having attended Top Gun, that military school made famous in the 1986 Tom Cruise film. I asked what drew him to document the private space race, and why is it such an exciting field today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Schmidle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was drawn to the story and drawn to this sort of unfamiliar industry in some ways by a terrible tragedy, by the Virgin Galactic crash on October 31 2014. I remember getting the news alert. And looking at the framework like the nut graph of this news story and thinking to myself, wait a second, there's a company based in California owned by a British billionaire who lives on a private island that's flying winged rocket ships in the California desert, one of which just crashed and killed a test pilot. I was like, you know, I didn't even know, we were still, I didn't even know that there were test pilots still doing this sort of thing, never mind kind of in that, you know, in this industry and in this world. So that was what piqued my interest. And I went out there shortly after that, to explore what was possible for what became a very long magazine piece for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;. So that was kind of my entry into the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So we'll get back to that crash a little bit later. But you say you weren't aware of what was going on in that private space race. But I think your father was a fighter pilot. And he even helped to train one of the men in your book who goes on to fly spacecraft for Virgin Galactic. So can you just tell me a bit about that connection, like did your father's profession lead you to an interest in in pilots initially.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when I started writing for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, just by sort of dint of accident the first two pieces that I did for the magazine were about the military. One was about a crazy court martial story in which the soldier had been tried three times for the same murder. And there were all these sort of interesting, legal questions about, double jeopardy, triple jeopardy, etc. So that was one piece. And the second piece was, I had sources inside of the Special Operations community and I had done this sort of talk about the Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. And I remember someone asking me if I considered myself a military guy at the magazine and I really resisted the categorization because I didn't, you know, I sort of imagined myself as like the crime guy who got to who stumbled into the bin Laden story, just started, you know, because I had the sources but that wasn't really what I was focused on. And in some ways, the Virgin Galactic story to me, yes, it felt familiar, but I had never been interested in aviation really, I was interested in a certain type of character and I felt like the test pilots who were flying these winged rocket ships in the California desert were those characters. But it wasn't really until I got out there that I both realised my dad's connection, and also, it took me a while. And when I say a while, you know, I worked on the project first as a magazine story for four years and, all told, the book for seven. And at one point, you know, I kind of had to stop and keep asking myself, what was holding my interest? And that in some ways, ultimately gets back to your question, which is that I realised that it was an opportunity for me to write about my dad, in a way that I had never thought was sort of doable. It always felt too direct and I wasn't sure how I could do that. And so suddenly, this, this was an opportunity for me to come at it from a different angle, for me to write about a world that I knew, because I'd grown up around sort of, you know, elite pilots, but that I had never studied per se. And look, truth be told, aviation in and of itself, I find it interesting, but not super, super interesting. I mean, I'm not like an aeroplane junkie. And it was always for me, it was the psychology of elite performers, whether they are navy seals, or whether they are, you know, investigators or whether they're test pilots. Like that's kind of the world that's always intrigued me. And that's, that's what ultimately brought me to this story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it's also a world of risk and masculinity. And I guess, talking about the psychology of these men, and it still is mostly men I think people are focusing or have been focusing, especially last summer, on the man in charge as an Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos - as three of the world's richest men who've all founded these private space travel companies, and are competing in what seems to be a very sort of machismo kind of way to build up their businesses. But before we get back to your book, what do you make of all that? I mean, that SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, competing together and, you know, maybe some reflections on who's most likely to win, if you have any thoughts on that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, sure. Well, yes, all three companies definitely run by sort of alpha men, run by billionaires, run by men who, in the case of Bezos and Musk particularly, kind of have everything that they could want here, like they've achieved, they've had such success as businessmen, here on Earth, that sort of space was both a challenge. And also, I feel like Jeff Bezos, his business empire has infiltrated and penetrated our lives to such an extent that, you know, it's really kind of uncanny. So that is unquestionably a factor, that's unquestionably a truth about who is leading this industry. For me, Richard Branson has never really been a big part of this story for me up until when he flew on July 11th. He doesn't spend a lot of time out in Mojave, California, his presence is kind of more like spiritual advisor than it is a CEO. I mean, he's not technically fluent. In fact, there's this curious legal prohibition on Richard Branson because the US Congress, I think, in the 70s drafted this piece of legislation that makes it illegal for US nationals to share technology or know how with foreign nationals that could be used for quote unquote dual purposes. So you know, rocket technology that could be, say, used to help an enemy government design a cruise missile. And so as a result of that, Richard Branson is actually legally prohibited from knowing the technical details of the rocket company that he founded. So his role is very much arm's length. And so he was always there. But in my eyes like it was an odd like presence and less of the guy on the shop room floor, which is how Elon Musk is and to a lesser extent, Jeff Bezos, from what I understand. There is a great deal of inherent sort of machismo and masculinity in these men trying to get there first in the case, you know, of the suborbital stuff, which is the contest. I mean, there are many different races. You sort of asked who's going to win. I mean, Elon Musk has for all intents and purposes won the space race, this new space race. He has now put well over 100 rockets into orbit. He has huge contracts with NASA. He&amp;rsquo;s the juggernaut here. Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are sort of fighting for the lesser spoils at this point, which is the suborbital space race. And they're just trying, they're trying to form companies that can shuttle tourists to the edge of space. And that's what we saw play out with the, you know, kind of back to back flights. And so yeah, that's it, but it is undoubtedly a male dominated world at this moment. But that's a reflection also of engineering schools. I mean, the engineering schools in the US, I think that in the female enrolment is like 20%, on average. So when you walk into the hangar at Virgin Galactic, you know, the women are, you know, terribly underrepresented. But that's a reflection also of the engineering schools that they're coming out of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I'm very intrigued and amused by this description of Branson as the all is, you know, like the man behind the curtain, because in the book, he does seem this weird spectral presence who sort of, you know, is not there at all and he kind of pops up and sort of seems to steal all the glory and these big extravagant parties. And it puts me in mind of when Bezos and of course, Branson, you know, they both launch themselves into space within weeks of each other. But on that very same day that Bezos took his journey, the Federal Aviation Administration actually said that their going to space is not enough to make you an astronaut. So what is the new definition? And was that a bit of a sort of pointed comment for them to have made at that particular time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I was also quite intrigued by the timing and the nature of the comment right? So both of these companies, particularly Virgin Galactic, just because they've been more of a vocal record over the course of the last 20 years - Bezos and Blue Origin have proceeded much more quietly and deliberately in some ways, and like in some ways, ultimately the question for a prospective customer is &amp;ldquo;Who do you want? What do you want sort of taking your space?&amp;rdquo; Do you want the company owned by the guy who you know brands everything including you know Coca Cola and including cola and condoms and dresses in you know wedding dresses to promote his wedding line? Or do you want to go to space with the guy who guarantees is going to get your package at your doorstep in two days? And so, is you the difference between their two flights was stark. I mean, I thought the Virgin Galactic flight, you know, it was good - Stephen Colbert hosting, you had, you know, musical guests. It was flashy, it was showy. Whereas the Blue Origin flight was, in some ways, downright kind of boring. Like it was so dry, but I think they are offering a more reliable product and there are a lot of technical explanations for them for that. But it's not a project that I would want to have spent seven years writing about, you know. There it's automated. Like I said, it's a relatively sort of staid affair. Going back to your question though, but this is this is very much Branson style is to kind of swoop in for the big parties. And that tension, that disconnect, between the operational realities on the ground and in the hangar in Mojave, California, and now also in Spaceport America in New Mexico, of the actual engineers and technicians and pilots who are who are operating these vehicles. And the disconnect between that reality and the marketing sort of razzmatazz, sort of smoke and mirrors side of the company that is trying to sell tickets is stark, and it is in some ways, I think, the company's own greatest threat, which is this central identity. It wants to be a luxury brand catering to the rich and famous, but it is still very much an experimental flight test programme. And they want to make the programme sound like it is an obvious next step for those who have everything here on Earth. But it's still an extraordinarily, you know, risky and dangerous and ultimately untested vehicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You've maybe pointed to its experimental nature, and there seems to be a bit of tension between just being a tourism business for extremely wealthy individuals. But also, you know, being perhaps on the cutting edge of science, or at least, doing these research flights and Virgin Galactic makes these claims that they're opening up space to two scientists or more scientists, then you know, we'll be able to reach space. So can you tell me a little bit about that side of the operation. Are those sort of claims valid, that they're really interested in research?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, how interested they are, how much that is a corporate priority is unclear. So I meant to sort of break that out in a few things. I think that technological advancements inevitably will come from companies that are exploring and experimenting with new technologies, right? So we don't know what might emerge or grow out of Virgin Galactic suborbital tourism company. And its usage of a hybrid rocket motor. Generally and traditionally you have liquid rocket engines and solid rocket motors. So that's either solid fuel or liquid fuel, and Virgin Galactic uses a hybrid of the two. Historically there are very few programmes that have used a hybrid rocket motor so you know, their ability to sort of harness this technology potentially opens up new opportunities that we just don't know what they are, but as I can tell, they're doing this to sell tickets. They're doing this to sell tickets to people who can afford originally $250,000 reservation and now, as of a few weeks ago, for those looking to sign up in the coming years. A $450,000 reservation, that's what they're here for. That's why Branson made the company, is not because he's interested in science for science&amp;rsquo;s sake, and not because as they also claim he's interested in quote unquote democratising space. Like, yes, if more people become astronauts as a result of their programme then they are sort of, you know, I guess they're democratising in that sense. But this gets back to your question about the FAA, which I didn't answer, then that is that Virgin Galactic has made that a marketing point for the past two, almost two decades now, that you will be an astronaut if you fly with us. And the way that they've in some ways kept customers interest over the course of the past 17 years is with inducements to, you know, to go on trips and give them you know, little business cards that say, future astronaut and things like that. And suddenly, for the FAA to say, hold on, we're not just going to be handing out astronaut wings to everyone who can afford a seat, you have to actually do something that contributes to research or science. Yeah, I think that that, you know, potentially sort of may have deflated some of the heft of the marketing sell that they and Blue Origin probably were planning to make. And I think that's what's so intriguing and fascinating about this company, and in this world, are that tension between the real sort of engineering stuff, and the more, you know, the more vapid, if you will, kind of rhetoric about what they're going to do in the process of making rich people, space tourists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we'll go into that more gritty behind the scenes stuff in part two, but just what you've been saying leads on to I guess, the big question that people started really asking, you know, with those Bezos and Branson flights, is that is it? Is this worth it? Because there's an argument that given the climate crisis, we should really be focused on saving our planet, rather than sending people into space, which of course generates a lot of pollution. So I mean, what would you say to that? Are there any other counter arguments worth considering? And maybe we can look a bit beyond Virgin Galactic to that because as you say, Musk's project and Bezos, is there a little bit more focus on that space exploration side?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, totally. I mean, I think I don't have the data right in front of me, but SpaceX, Elon Musk's venture, they have lowered the cost, the launch costs; essentially what it takes to get a pound or a kilogramme of cargo into space, whether it's a satellite or whether it's to supply the International Space Station, they have lowered that cost significantly and by allowing larger satellite deployments you're providing internet access to previously uncovered areas of the world. I think that's important. I think that's really significant. And I think that your offering, you know, whether it's clarity of phone service, or its clarity of GPS services, that's real science, and I think that they are doing that. And I think that they are also looking beyond and you know, in terms of the deep space exploration, Elon Musk has always made it clear from the get go that everything for him is a step along the way to ultimately colonising Mars. I have heard Branson express what his quote unquote hopes and dreams are. And there was in 2016 as Virgin Galactic was unveiling its newly built spaceship after the 2014 crash, there was a reporter asked the very question you're sort of asking now, and Branson said he had just come back from Washington and he was meeting with a senator. And he was telling this senator that Virgin Galactic after they sort of master the space tourism thing that they're going to look deep, and they're going to start thinking about how they can, you know, zap asteroids and things like that. And I was like, talk about putting the cart before the horse. Yeah, we're light years away from that. And so I have never heard though, a long term, sort of deep space exploration argument or seen any documentation of any initiatives of Virgin Galactic. I think the goal was always to, you know, to create the space tourism company. So it's a long winded way of saying, Yes, on the Elon Musk stuff. Bezos is also trying to build a lunar lander. There are scientific priorities there. I don't know that they are as present with Virgin Galactic programme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks, Nick. Now we've got a handle on where we're at and the new space race and a bit we'll go back to look at the lives of the people that make it happen. A word now from our producer Alice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice Bloch:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You're listening to &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; magazine, where Niki here is deputy editor.

It&amp;rsquo;s beautifully made, expertly edited and won't leave you drowning amid stacks of magazines that you never read. Perfect, back now to Niki and Nick Schmidle on the 21st century space race.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Nick, &lt;em&gt;Test Gods&lt;/em&gt; has been compared to that classic work of 70s New Journalism, Tom Wolfe's &lt;em&gt;The Right Stuff&lt;/em&gt;, which documented the lives of NASA's test pilots and astronauts. But this seems to be the first major work to focus on private space companies. Why do you think it's been such a neglected subject?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Partially because access has been very difficult. It is hard because of the corporate priorities and because of the competition. These companies have been understandably reluctant, wary of letting outsiders in, of letting reporters in that they don't know and don't trust. There was a great book that came out about SpaceX just this spring called Lift Off that does sort of get into the early SpaceX stuff but you know when I say early it's, you know, when SpaceX was launching rockets off this missiles sort of you know, crazy James Bond villain stuff they had. They had this this island in the middle of the South Pacific in which they were launching rockets. There were anecdotes of rockets going up in the air and then turning around and like coming straight back down, and everybody's scattering and then them having to, you know, don scuba gear to recover parts from the coral reefs. I mean, that's pretty crazy stuff. But following the kind of day to day travails of these companies has been really difficult for all those reasons. I mean, these people are, often the employees are covered and covered by NDA, etc. So it's been, I think it's been a challenge. When I went to Virgin Galactic on behalf of the New Yorker, initially, I said, I want to write about the programme. But we want real real access. My editor said, you know, only we're only interested if we can get real access. And by that, we meant that we wanted to watch them work. We didn't want a sort of Richard Branson led dog and pony show in which I show up in Mojave, and I spent a day there and he, you know, I do a couple of interviews, and then the piece ends inevitably with a quote from Richard Branson saying, &amp;ldquo;You know, hopefully next year is going to be the big year like we wanted&amp;rdquo;. We wanted there to be something real to see and real to report. So I mean, it was my timing was fortuitous, the company had just had this horrible crash and I said, I want to watch you all do the work, I wanted to watch them kind of rise from the ashes and see if they could build another spaceship and make a go of this as a company. They had flown three previous rocket-powered test flights. The fourth one is the one that crashed and I said, I want to stay with you until you fly the fifth rocket flights I want to watch you build a new ship, put it through a flight test programme, and get back to where you were - essentially the day of the morning of the crash on October 31 2014. And so I went in, and we thought that was going to be maybe 18 months, maybe two years. And it ended up being four years. And once you're in a company like that, once you're in anywhere as a reporter, you know, you try and take advantage of that access and make it so that when the access ultimately comes to an end, you can continue to report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On that crash that seriously injured the pilot, and it killed the co-pilot Michael Ellsbury, there were accusations at the time, and the investigation later found that there were inadequate safety procedures and a lack of rigorous oversight. Can you just comment on this idea that maybe private profit-driven companies are more likely to cut corners? Or would you say that that was an accident that could have just as easily happened at NASA and that, you know, these flights are risky by their very nature?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's a great question. I would find it very hard to think that that kind of accident could have occurred at NASA in 2014. Could that kind of accident have occurred at NASA in the early 60s when they were charging hard to try to beat the Soviets into space? Yeah, totally. I think it would be much more likely. But I think that as a result of the layers upon layers of bureaucracy, and therefore risk aversion that have crept into NASA, it is very hard to imagine that a pilot committing the kind of error that Mike Ellsbury unfortunately committed that morning, that there would have been what they call a single point failure on a NASA vehicle that would have allowed a single pilot mistake to have led to the crash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So we've talked a little bit about that heroism of astronauts. Obviously, they're dealing with this risk, and it seems a good time to mention a piece from the &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; archive that speaks to that. So this piece is called &lt;em&gt;In Praise of Astronauts&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Sims, and it was about Chris Hadfield. So Hadfield, this NASA astronaut who built up a huge cult following after broadcasting from the International Space Station starting in 2012. And that piece notes that while they might be held up as these national heroes most astronauts seem to understand that their work transcends their own individual success or that of their country and see it as instead being for the benefit of all humankind. Did the astronauts you spoke to a Virgin Galactic share that same kind of spirit?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, I mean, that's a highfalutin high-minded appraisal of one's contributions. I think I'm not diminishing that. I'm not suggesting that Hadfield or any of the other any other astronaut doesn't. I'm not questioning the integrity of the statement. But what I think and what drew me to the project was Mark Stuckey who's the test pilot who I really profiled in the book. Stuckey&amp;rsquo;s quest to become an astronaut first through NASA later through Scaled Composites where he was the test pilot there and then ultimately with Virgin Galactic - you know, this was a personal goal that he had been chasing since he was a kid. He had in the process lost his family lost friends. And you know it for me, it was like a bigger story. It was a story about family and about fatherhood and about what we're sort of willing to give up in order to chase those dreams and whether in some ways it's kind of worth it in the end. And his willingness to open up himself and his, you know, his files and his email inbox in his house, and a lot of painful memories of you know, him being estranged from his children after a really nasty divorce. And that, to me, that level of intimacy and grittiness and reality was something that I never, but it was unfamiliar from other astronaut profiles. And so that's in some ways what I appreciated and I think what drew me to him, he felt real. He was doing this because it was something he'd always wanted to do. And you know, ultimately when he became an astronaut, and he flew the successful mission and I spent that evening with him, we went back to his house and he opened up an expensive bottle of whiskey and it was, you know, he and I and his wife, second wife, and I was like, well so you know, what do you think? You know, is it is it everything you sort of hoped it would be? And you know, there's a little bit of a shrug and he was like, &amp;lsquo;Yeah, it's pretty cool&amp;rsquo;. But like, you could tell that it hadn't changed his outlook radically but um, you know, it was it was it was good for him. I'm sure he was incredibly relieved and proud and satisfied but you know, I think this was a personal quest and, you know, many of us are all sort of on these you know, personal quest and his willingness to get real was what was ultimately kind of what held my interest for all these years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And is it right that your father trained Stuckey at Top Gun, the elite fighter pilot school?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So both my dad and Stuckey are Top Gun graduates but my father was an instructor at the dogfighting school. All marine fighter pilots go through the school in Yuma Arizona, where you learn how to be a fighter pilot and my dad was an instructor there when Stuckey was a student there. They overlapped in time. They may have sort of been in some seminars together, they may have flown together once or twice but my dad wasn't schooling Mark in the ways of being a Top Gun student. They then diverged and went very different ways and Stuckey stayed in the Marines for another 10 years or so and then and then went to become a NASA test pilot and then the Air Force, and then ultimately got involved with the Virgin Galactic programme. My dad stayed in the Marines and eventually became a three star general and head of all aviation in the Marine Corps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You use &lt;em&gt;Test Gods&lt;/em&gt; in part to explore some of your attitudes to masculinity, which is as much to do with your relationship with Stuckey and the other pilots as your reflections on your relationship with your father. Can you just comment on that and maybe also just on the general macho culture of pilots?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it is a macho culture and it's potentially why I I'm not a pilot. I was back in the States last month and was at a wedding and my dad my brother, my cousins my uncle - every male above the age of 10 and below the age of 70 in my family has served in the military in some way shape or form and I haven't. I'm interested in that world but it's not like it's my world. But one of the things that I wrestled with as I started writing the book was appreciating what it was I got from my dad when I was growing up. In some ways I rebelled against that, I resisted, but there was always this notion when I was growing up that you know, my dad was a fighter pilot and is a has a PhD in philosophy and lectures at the Sorbonne and also raced motorcycles and growing up in his there was never a question of could you do something you wanted to do, it was like No, just put one foot in front of the other and do it. But also my dad was not around very much. There was a little bit of physical distance and an emotional distance. And I remember a few years ago thinking, alright, what how do I give that to my children? How do I get that too? I have two sons that are 10 and seven, how do I sort of inspire them? I am around more often, much more often than my dad was but so how do I sort of set that role model? How can I inspire but how can I also sort of be present and you know, in comfort and I don't think that I you know, I didn't come away with a golden answer to it. We were on a road trip in California and Virgin Galactic conducted its second spaceflight attempt. And I was able to bring my kids and was able to watch that flight with them on the flightline. And, you know, it was sort of life changing, I think for them and for me to be able to share that moment with them. And so that ultimately is what the book was, it was an exploration of relationships between fathers and sons and it's an exploration of masculinity. But it's not sort of an exploration of the traditional sort of hard-knuckled masculinity necessarily and it's all of us kind of trying to find what kind of man what kind of father what kind of son we want to be and so writing about test pilots was a way into that story, was kind of a vehicle to tell that story. But ultimately, I think the story is bigger than a story about test pilot or astronauts or certainly about, you know, a single company,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nick Schmidle, journalist and author of &lt;em&gt;Test Gods&lt;/em&gt;. Thank you so much for joining us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for having me. It's been fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I'm back now with Samira, who has been listening along to the conversation. So I learned a lot from talking to Nick and he did mention Musk's goal to land humans on Mars, but we didn't get much chance to talk in depth about that, or about Space X&amp;rsquo;s contract with NASA to land astronauts on the moon by 2024. And I just I just wondered what you thought about all that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, 2024 seems like quite an arbitrary target, I thought as I was reading about it. Apparently this was set in the Trump era as he'd hoped it would be the crowning glory on his second term, obviously didn't work out like that. But I thought that was a reminder of how space travel&amp;rsquo;s still so intimately tied to this idea of national glory and so on. Even if the space race seems to be shifting to one that's predominantly being fought between billionaires, rather than this competition between nation states as it was in the Cold War era. I guess it's still, even though you have these kind of big masculine egos vying with each other, you still do have a sense that we're in which space exploration, you know, refracts back on to our national politics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, you imagined that there has to be some tensions there between the aims of these sort of billionaire individuals and of government programmes, Musk said that he wants to colonise Mars as a self-sustaining civilization. And he said various things in various speeches, basically, about preserving our species from different disasters. He's mentioned the advent of World War Three and described Mars as a backup plan. So it seems it seems a little bit bizarre that he's working with NASA to be honest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I guess it's indicative of how much the dynamics of space travel have changed. So I wonder if it's NASA losing its total monopoly on space travel, but I guess those in favour of the move would make the same arguments that are always made about private public partnerships. So just the idea of bringing efficiency and competition to the space sector and bringing down the cost of space travel, and so on, which it does seem that that Musk's company has done. I don't know, I guess as you allude to, it does just seem there's a big gulf between the quest for scientific knowledge and so on that that is NASA's mission statement and the idea of billionaires wanting to colonise other planets or flog tickets to other planets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, and I get your point about the private public partnerships, but it did, did put me in mind at that just absolute contrast between those sort of the ego driven progress and say what Carlo Rovelli was saying in the context of quantum mechanics, you know, just his point that, that sense of, you know, mystery and humbleness and discovery and uncertainty, just all of those being really primary kind of driving forces of cutting edge scientific inquiry. So yeah, it just couldn't be a bigger contrast there. Okay, so that's it from us today. But remember, you can listen back to past episodes like the Carlo Rovelli one, whenever you like, on whatever app you use, and if you hit subscribe, you'll have them delivered straight to you when they're ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that's it too for series three of &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt;. You've been listening to me Samira Shackle and to Niki Seth-Smith. Our executive producer and fellow presenter in other episodes is Alice Bloch. And our sound engineer was Dave Crackles. Take care and we'll see you soon. Thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further reading:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Test Gods: Tragedy and Triumph in the New Space Race' (2021), Nicholas Schmidle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'The Right Stuff' (1979), Tom Wolfe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="/articles/4156/in-praise-of-astronauts"&gt;'In Praise of Astronauts' (2013) Paul Sims for New Humanist magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Q&amp;A: Jonathan Franzen</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5874/qa-jonathan-franzen#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img title="WENN Rights Ltd / Alamy Stock Photo" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/F625P0.jpg" height="842" alt="F625P0" width="1294" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan Franzen is the author of numerous novels, including &amp;ldquo;The Corrections&amp;rdquo;, and nonfiction books. In January, Fourth Estate published &amp;ldquo;What if We Stopped Pretending?&amp;rdquo;, a hardback edition of his controversial 2019 New Yorker essay in which he argues that to prepare for the coming climate apocalypse, we must admit that we can&amp;rsquo;t prevent it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your essay on climate denialism, now published in book form, created a huge backlash. Were you misunderstood?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was well understood. There were two groups of people responding to the piece. The individuals who numbered in the hundreds, they got very clearly what I was talking about. Then there was this larger response on social media. The essay can be summarised in the title: &lt;em&gt;What if We Stopped Pretending?&lt;/em&gt; We are stuck in a rhetoric of false hope. That is a holdover from the decades when it was possible to avert climate catastrophe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You argue that &amp;ldquo;meaningful action&amp;rdquo; is an illusion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, meaningful action is not going to suffice. As things become more unstable, our resilience is going to be put to a test. The reality is that large parts of the world are soon going to be uninhabitable. I&amp;rsquo;m arguing that as a [global] society we should be adapting and strengthening our political systems to withstand those ecological shocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also suggest that the scientific community is underestimating climate change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many people who work in climate, and what they say privately is often not what they say publicly. [Scientists] have spent 30 years trying to raise the alarm, arguing that we can solve this problem. But they are now facing the position that the problem is unsolvable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If climate change is unsolvable, what&amp;rsquo;s the point in raising the alarm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, we can partly do something about it. We can slash our carbon emissions. We can slow things down a bit. We can maybe take the edge off the very worst outcomes. But this false hope in order to motivate people results in cynicism. The ordinary citizen has a good radar. They know when someone isn&amp;rsquo;t telling the truth. Back in 2005, we were told: we still have ten years to [address the] climate. So when a scientist or an activist in 2021 steps up and says: we still have ten years, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s healthy or honest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why put so much emphasis on local battles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climate is a global problem . . . one individual is essentially powerless to do anything about it. You can live in a yurt and grow your own crops organically, but that won&amp;rsquo;t have the slightest impact on the future. However, look around you, see the problems. Homelessness. The degradation of your soil. The likely future water supply for your community. Or look at the political divisions on your city council. These are all things you can actually do something about. It&amp;rsquo;s really depressing to just beat your head against a problem where no contribution of yours could possibly affect it. But it&amp;rsquo;s very satisfying to select a few problems where your contribution might actually matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reaction of the right in the US to the climate crisis appears to be blatant denial, but isn&amp;rsquo;t there also a naivety in the approach of the political left?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no respect for the right&amp;rsquo;s position on climate change. I think it&amp;rsquo;s insulting. But there is something to the rightist critique of the Green New Deal [GND]. The GND advances this agenda that has very little to do with climate. It&amp;rsquo;s sold as [an idea] that will create jobs and tremendous economic growth, as we move to renewable energy. It&amp;rsquo;s a delusion to imagine that the United States in the space of a few years could turn itself into a country that looks like, say, Denmark. There are a number of reasons for this. Namely: the political divisions and our history. So yes, there is a naivety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your 2010 novel &amp;ldquo;Freedom&amp;rdquo; hinted at the idea that Americans expect far too much from their civil liberties. Is that what you believe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extremity of the political divide in [the US] has been evident for many years. In the end, it really comes down to a fundamental misunderstanding of what freedom is. In the US it seems to be this incredibly adolescent notion of what freedom should be. Like [you hear people say]: &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell me to wear a mask&amp;rdquo; [during the pandemic]. &amp;ldquo;You know, I&amp;rsquo;m a citizen, I have my rights.&amp;rdquo; Well, yeah, I mean that flies if you&amp;rsquo;re 14 years old, but good God, grow up! Look at Europe by comparison. After two world wars where millions died, many of the countries of Europe have realised freedom is about more than just having the absolute right to do whatever you feel like doing, whenever you feel like doing it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One theme that recurs in your fiction is family life and its complications. Has your attitude to this subject changed as you&amp;rsquo;ve aged?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a new novel called Crossroads coming out in October. And I explore many of those same family conflicts [in this new book]. Like loyalty to yourself versus family loyalty. But I also find myself less interested in judging my characters or laughing at them. That&amp;rsquo;s a by-product of getting older. I used to run with a certain kind of comedy, especially between parents and their children. But when my parents died, it became more apparent to me how much I love them, and what good parents they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve previously spoken about confronting shame as a novelist in the public sphere. What do you mean by this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of the chief obstacles any fiction writer contends with: the feeling of shame. The shame of putting yourself out there. The shame of exposing yourself. We&amp;rsquo;ve all been exposed in public and experienced the pain of being seen intimately in a public space. That pain is always there for the novelist. Furthermore, it&amp;rsquo;s the first emotion one has, when one contemplates writing about, say, the worst things one has ever done, or the most humiliating situation one has ever found themselves in. Of course, the worst thing you&amp;rsquo;ve ever done is exactly what you should be writing about. Good writing goes to the extremes. Learning how to manage shame, how to transform the impulse of shame into something else, whether it&amp;rsquo;s forgiving yourself or laughing at yourself, or whatever &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s primary [material] for all fiction writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where does your reputation as an angry, misanthropic, privileged male come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a theory on this. I am a privileged white male. And if that is ipso facto a problem for you, you will look for the worst side of me and cast me in the worst possible light. I know I used to badmouth people who were more successful than I was. I would look for things in their work that would prove they were a bad person. So it&amp;rsquo;s just a natural human response. All I can really do is not read the things that are written about me [in the press]. Also, because I have that privilege, I try and tell the truth about things that more cautious people might fear to weigh in on. Like the climate situation. I have nothing to lose. I write my novels, and people read them. So if the entire climate community in the US is angry at me for this essay, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change my life at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has cancel culture curtailed freedom of speech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not living in the Soviet Union. But I do know friends who are alarmed about censoring, cancelling, self-censoring and self-censorship. It&amp;rsquo;s something to be mindful of. But my cocky optimism tells me there will be people who try to represent reality in its complexity, and who won&amp;rsquo;t toe the political line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist autumn 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>Curiously, they forgot to ban “irony”. Maybe they didn’t know the word exists.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bill is just posturing by sanctimonious Republicans, and has virtually no chance of passing. If it did, I suppose I’d have to gallop across the border to rescue my granddaughter once she hit school age.</p>
<p>It’s such a strangely blatant defiance of the principles these people usually hide behind, but there’s a reason for it. We can’t make our white children conscious of racism.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Wisconsin Assembly passed legislation on a party-line vote Tuesday that would bar public schools from teaching critical race theory, the latest Republican-controlled legislative chamber to take action on a culture war issue that erupted in school board meetings around the country this summer.</p>
<p>The measure mirrors efforts in other states to block teachers from instructing students on concepts of racial injustice or inherent bias.  </p>
<p>But in testimony before a Wisconsin Assembly committee considering the bill in August, one of the measure’s lead authors went farther than in other states, spelling out specific words that would be barred from the classroom. </p>
<p>“It has come to our attention, and to some of the people who traveled here to Madison today, that a growing number of school districts are teaching material that attempts to redress the injustice of racism and sexism by employing racism and sexism, as well as promoting psychological distress in students based on these immutable characteristics,” state Rep. Chuck Wichgers (R) said of his bill. “No one should have to undergo the humiliation of being told that they are inferior to someone else. We are all members of the human race.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing in Critical Race Theory is about telling anyone they are inferior — quite the opposite. You can tell what really concerns him, though: the idea that <em>white</em> people might be told they’re inferior. When it was just discrimination against brown people, then it was OK to talk about their imaginary inferiority.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wichgers, who represents Muskego in the legislature, attached an addendum to his legislation that included a list of “terms and concepts” that would violate the bill if it became law.</p>
<p>Among those words: “Woke,” “whiteness,” “White supremacy,” “structural bias,” “structural racism,” “systemic bias” and “systemic racism.” The bill would also bar “abolitionist teaching,” in a state that sent more than 91,000 soldiers to fight with the Union Army in the Civil War. </p>
<p>The list of barred words or concepts includes “equity,” “inclusivity education,” “multiculturalism” and “patriarchy,” as well as “social justice” and “cultural awareness.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoops, there goes social studies and history.</p>

    <title>Book review: Cardinal Sin</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5879/book-review-cardinal-sin#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/9781782183846.jpg" height="500" alt="9781782183846" width="312" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardinal Sin: Challenging Power Abuse in the Catholic Church&lt;/strong&gt; (Columba Press) by Brian Devlin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2013, just before departing for Rome to take part in the election of a new Pope, the senior most official of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland suddenly resigned. Cardinal Keith O&amp;rsquo;Brien had been accused of past sexual misconduct by four serving and former priests, who in their frustration had taken their story to the media. As the news went public, O&amp;rsquo;Brien announced his retirement. Within days he issued a statement announcing that he would not contest the allegations. Soon after, he vanished from public life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These events were unprecedented and spectacular. Cardinal O&amp;rsquo;Brien was an instantly recognisable figure in Scotland. Habitually dressed in grandiose clerical vestments, he was a staple of public life and hobnobbed with political leaders and public figures, including the disgraced former First Minister, Alex Salmond, as well as, pertinently, the notorious sex offender, Jimmy Saville. O&amp;rsquo;Brien&amp;rsquo;s had long been a loud voice advocating privilege for religion, and Catholicism in particular. He demanded exemptions for the faith from progressive legislation, including the introduction of same-sex marriage. Ironically, O&amp;rsquo;Brien&amp;rsquo;s political campaigning took place at a time when Scotland had become an overwhelmingly secular society. Social liberalism was increasingly associated with a rejuvenated national identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Brien seemed particularly fascinated and preoccupied by male homosexuality, which he considered to be a &amp;ldquo;moral degradation&amp;rdquo;, and LGBT people &amp;ldquo;captives of sexual aberrations&amp;rdquo;. His outbursts rarely referred directly to gay women, trans people or non-binary people, but imagined homosexuality as associated with a deviant form of masculinity. Yet they told of O&amp;rsquo;Brien&amp;rsquo;s own troubled sexual identity and the culture in which it was formed. He was a deeply closeted gay man who had abused his clerical status to groom younger men, often trainee priests. As Brian Devlin writes in Cardinal Sin: Challenging power abuse in the Catholic Church, his account of being the &amp;ldquo;whistleblower&amp;rdquo; whose endeavours precipitated the cardinal&amp;rsquo;s fall, &amp;ldquo;With apparently little regard for the consequences, O&amp;rsquo;Brien pounded in his pulpit, outraged by the sin and sexual savagery he saw all around him, while at the same time he abused his power within his own circle: those who he had a special duty of care for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cardinal Sin is a memoir which is by turns fascinating, curious and admirably reflective. It stands not as a simple account of the downfall of a sexual predator, but rather a thoughtful religious autobiography. We learn of Devlin&amp;rsquo;s journey into the priesthood as a vulnerable young man, his resignation from it, and his attempts over subsequent decades to reach composure with his troubled past and his shattered clerical identity. He offers an inside account of his ultimate struggle to hold O&amp;rsquo;Brien to account for his actions in the face of obstruction from the Catholic authorities in Scotland and Rome, as well as an assessment of the substantial fall-out from the affair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gendered and sexual regimes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Devlin&amp;rsquo;s own journey to priesthood began at St Andrew&amp;rsquo;s Seminary in Drygrange, an elite institution buried deep within the Scottish countryside. Devlin was to quickly discover that Drygrange was &amp;ldquo;not a holy place&amp;rdquo; but instead a deeply dysfunctional and &amp;ldquo;breath-takingly strange&amp;rdquo; environment inhabited by bewildered students and troubled teaching staff. Here he encountered Keith O&amp;rsquo;Brien, trendy priest, &amp;ldquo;Irish charmer&amp;rdquo; and spiritual director of the college, with special responsibility for first year students. O&amp;rsquo;Brien groomed Devlin, groped him on car journeys and during prayer sessions, and, finally, assaulted him in his bedroom one night after a boozy dinner. The following morning, he manipulated him into silence. Devlin experienced an epiphanic moment: Keith O&amp;rsquo;Brien was a &amp;ldquo;cynical conman and sham&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devlin is a genial and insightful narrator. His memoir has plenty to say about the Catholic Church&amp;rsquo;s tortured relationship with same-sex desire between men. He also provides an insightful depiction of the gendered and sexual regime that moulded O&amp;rsquo;Brien. Sex between men was criminalised in Scotland until 1980. Historians Roger Davidson and Gayle Davis have observed that even the name of the country&amp;rsquo;s first gay rights organisation, the Scottish Minorities Group, was closeted. Homosexuality was a subject surrounded by silence and dread - a sociological survey of Glasgow teenagers in the early 1960s recorded that it was a subject that inspired &amp;ldquo;real fear&amp;rdquo; on the part of boys. Many people simply did not know much about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devlin was among these. Yet at Drygrange he found a barely concealed queer subculture, where he was &amp;ldquo;astounded&amp;rdquo; by sights including same-sex couples perambulating the grounds arm in arm, and &amp;ldquo;big hairy men&amp;rdquo; who &amp;ldquo;giggled as they chased each other around the pool table&amp;rdquo;. All the while &amp;ndash; despite it being forbidden - a certain version of male homosexuality was promoted, with students being admonished by O&amp;rsquo;Brien to conduct themselves as &amp;ldquo;manly men&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is instructive, given O&amp;rsquo;Brien&amp;rsquo;s life in the closet, that he told trainee priests to conform outwardly to normative masculinity and to maintain discretion and secrecy. He further used religious mechanisms and culture to absolve himself from &amp;ldquo;sins&amp;rdquo; and to ensure the silence of his victims. But was O&amp;rsquo;Brien, in some sense, a victim as well? He was socialised at a young age into spiritual sadism and unremitting homophobia. As far as is known, he was unable to own his own sexuality until his dying day. He died in exile and disgrace. Yet no excuses can be made. He continually abused his position of power and trust, and he was a monstrous hypocrite. Ultimately, O&amp;rsquo;Brien could have chosen to behave differently. He could also have been courageous enough to leave the priesthood and live a more honest and authentic life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout his book, Devlin ponders his own religious subjectivity. He wonders whether, despite his crisis of faith due to the depredations of O&amp;rsquo;Brien and the narcissism and grandiosity of members of the Catholic Church&amp;rsquo;s ruling hierarchy, he remains a priest in a &amp;ldquo;deeper and more personal way&amp;rdquo; than that associated with the celebrating of ceremonies. Devlin&amp;rsquo;s residual attachment to Catholicism - he describes himself as a &amp;ldquo;Collapsed Catholic&amp;rdquo; and makes clear that Catholicism remains central to his identity - suggest that perhaps they cannot. He insists that his book tries not to write from a place of anger and hurt, and he finds himself unable to hate an organisation which has caused him significant distress and emotional trauma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final section of his book is concerned with hopeful proposals for the delivery of liberalising changes, such as the ordaining of women priests, which Devlin hopes might salvage a troubled Church. Many readers will surely wonder if such measures will ever be implemented. Even if they can, would it all be worth it? Does the Catholic Church deserve Brian Devlin?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Book review: Terminal Boredom: Stories</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5872/book-review-terminal-boredom-stories#utm_source=rss" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/9781788739887-bd671225315344687c64b5ea26e8d9b6.jpg" height="1228" alt="9781788739887-bd671225315344687c64b5ea26e8d9b6" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminal Boredom: Stories &lt;/strong&gt;(Verso) by Izumi Suzuki&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Izumi Suzuki published her final story 35 years ago, but this introductory selection of her writing could have been written in the nuclear-paranoia 80s, the cyberpunk 90s, or yesterday. An iconic figure in Japanese science fiction, Suzuki&amp;rsquo;s darkly irreverent writing has seen her compared to the genre&amp;rsquo;s giants &amp;ndash; like Ursula Le Guin and Margaret Atwood &amp;ndash; but her stories also bring to mind Bret Easton Ellis&amp;rsquo;s affectless ennui, or the glossily grim cautionary tales of the popular TV show Black Mirror. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzuki&amp;rsquo;s settings range from the intimate &amp;ndash; bars, caf&amp;eacute;s, arcades, nightclubs &amp;ndash; to the desolate: ruined cities and worlds on the edge of the abyss. Her protagonists negotiate these spaces with a cool detachment. Their days are parcelled into dissolute drinking, shift-work or therapy sessions while in the background, sinister government initiatives abound, from gender segregation to &amp;ldquo;voluntary&amp;rdquo; euthanasia. The futuristic details here &amp;ndash; replicating technology, tentacled waiting-staff, elections via celebrity voting proxies &amp;ndash; seem less significant than the exploration of mundanely earthbound concerns like addiction, flirtation, heartbreak and guilt, which follow the characters through space and time. In &amp;ldquo;Forgotten&amp;rdquo;, lifestyle differences and political outlooks diverge between planets and alien races, not between countries and classes. But imperialism and colonisation have also upsized, their sights set now on not just nations but whole worlds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terminal Boredom&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s style is stark and often strikingly snappy (&amp;ldquo;I have no remorse about having no remorse&amp;rdquo; is a typical line) but subdued, making its sporadic dashes of drama all the more devastating. The collection&amp;rsquo;s several translators manage to capture Suzuki&amp;rsquo;s hardboiled, laconic cadences of conversation and communication. Invented slang is mixed with retro transatlanticisms: vibe, sucker, phoney, killing my buzz, off your rocker. Elsewhere, there are lines of striking familiarity &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;But that&amp;rsquo;s the way we&amp;rsquo;d talk: duelling monologues, each of us in a bubble all her own&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; where a particular kind of companionable alienation has resonance in our current age of locked-down isolation and living through social media. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In keeping with their mostly youthful protagonists and metropolitan settings, pop culture forms a vital part of these stories. In some, real-world songs and films act as a supporting structure, their familiarity offering an emotional anchor and a line of mutual connection as time warps and memories merge. Emotional confusion is reinforced by a quote out of place or the sudden chronological derangement of a playlist. In the title story, film and TV provoke emotional responses more comfortably than the drama of real life does &amp;ndash; up to and including murder. In &amp;ldquo;That Old Seaside Club&amp;rdquo;, nostalgia induces emotional clarity, honesty and connection, but only because the characters are reliving their regret-filled lives of emotional withdrawal and passivity, until they learn to let go and accept. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recurring theme here is the retention of past culture in disjointed pieces, like fragments of a dream. This is most explicit in &amp;ldquo;Night Picnic&amp;rdquo;, where learned behaviours, including rebellion and heartbreak, are jarringly performed rather than felt. The characters learn from jumbled cultural representations of &amp;ldquo;earthling&amp;rdquo; life and ancestor-worship, carrying out pointless rituals and duties for no other reason than that it makes &amp;ndash; or keeps &amp;ndash; them human. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsewhere, there is intriguing speculation on gender roles and dynamics in futures marked by abundance or frugality, overpopulation, sexual apathy and mutual suspicion. For Suzuki&amp;rsquo;s mostly female protagonists, men appear as subjects of mystery, curiosity and temptation &amp;ndash; absent or background figures even when not overtly segregated. There is a focus on the significance of familial relationships &amp;ndash; mothers, grandmothers, sisters &amp;ndash; and on friendship, as much as, if not more than, on romantic prospects. We hear of &amp;ldquo;virgin births&amp;rdquo; of daughters with no need for a man&amp;rsquo;s involvement. In the absence of men, we see women take on both their duties and their looks and behaviour. We see characters defy the ageing process and the passage of time, and slip in and out of gender roles just as easily. The social classifications of nerd, hipster, addict and fashion victim are more enduring here than contemporary definitions of gender, race or class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Futuristic fiction, paradoxically, can feel both retro and solidly rooted in the here and now. The absurdity and futility of going through the motions &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Why do I have to keep on living that life?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; is a thematic refrain throughout this collection. &lt;em&gt;Terminal Boredom&lt;/em&gt; is an uneasy, dizzying descent through worlds that blend past, present and future, but such well-written anatomies of anxiety and dissatisfaction are both timeless and of obvious relevance today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from the New Humanist autumn 2021 edition. &lt;a href="/supportus"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Black resistance and racist policing w/Adam Elliott-Cooper</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How have certain types of crime been racialised in the United Kingdom? What are the colonial origins of institutional racism within the British police force? And how has whiteness been mobilised to divide different communities across Britain? Samira Shackle spoke with Adam Elliott-Cooper, sociologist at Greenwich University, whose book, &lt;em&gt;Black Resistance to British Policing, &lt;/em&gt;was published in May this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A conversation on racism, identity and social movements in the United Kingdom that explores how common conceptions around the particular attributes of certain communities have developed. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hosts: &lt;/strong&gt;Alice Bloch and Samira Shackle&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exec Producer: &lt;/strong&gt;Alice Bloch&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound Engineer: &lt;/strong&gt;David Crackles&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music: &lt;/strong&gt;Danosongs&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Image artwork: &lt;/strong&gt;Ed Dingli&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want access to more fresh thinking, why not subscribe to New Humanist magazine?

I'm Samira Shackle. And I'm Alice Bloch. And &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt; is brought to you from &lt;em&gt;New Humanist&lt;/em&gt; magazine and The Rationalist Association. This podcast is where we catch up with people whose work and ideas challenged dogma and lazy thinking. It is the space to reflect on reason and unreason, debate and criticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alice Bloch:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And something we've explored in every series of &lt;em&gt;With Reason&lt;/em&gt; so far is racism and inequality, the reality of it and stories of resistance to it. Back in series one, Jason Arday told us all about growing up in the 90s and about the contradictions of the so called cool Britannia era. That was the decade in which the black teenager Stephen Lawrence was murdered, and in which the McPherson report concluded that the investigation into that killing had been marred by professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership. More than two decades on from that report, despite some changes, racism and policing all too often appear in the same breath, something highlighted by the Black Lives Matter movements, both here and in the US. And indeed, elsewhere. Samira that's something you're discussing with your guest today, the sociologist Adam Elliott-Cooper. I'll leave it to you to tell us more about him. And I'll be back at the end for a catch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samira Shackle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, so Adam is a sociologist at Greenwich University. And in his new book, &lt;em&gt;Black Resistance to British Policing&lt;/em&gt;, he looks at the activism that made things like Black Lives Matter as possible. But he also approaches racism as something that goes way beyond the interpersonal level. So this idea of one individual being racist and discriminatory against another. Instead, he argues that black resistance confronts an entire global system of racial classification and exploitation and violence. So it's a sobering read, it highlights the links between imperial cultures colonial war and contemporary racisms, plural. But it's also hopeful, but gets inspired by experience too. So before digging into that historical structural side of things, Adam told me first about how his time spent working with young people actually brought him to writing about policing and resistance in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Elliott-Cooper:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess the book begins in 2011. And in 2011, I was working as a youth worker in Hackney in northeast London, where a lot of the work we were doing with the young people, there was educational workshops, and things like that. But I was always really interested in the more social activities that we could do with the young people that could explore different kinds of social or political issues. Sometimes I was invited into a youth club and asked to do a workshop on how to deal with a stop and search or police misuse of power. But a lot of the conversations often extended to why the police operate in the way they do, what the history of policing is, what the wider context is, but sometimes will be put into one workshop in a school about the history in the context of policing. But a lot of the young people wanted to always know about, okay, but what can we practically do? How can I deal with when I'm being stopped and searched? How can I challenge misuse of police power. And so I began to realise that policing was this issue, which not only was something which a lot of young people engaged with, but it was simultaneously something which better enabled people to understand the existing social order, and the historical context in which it emerged, but also enabled people to come up with practical solutions to challenge the existing social order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting. So you said that was in 2011, which was also the year of the London riots 10 years ago. So those started in Tottenham, in the north of London, actually, where I live. And I think the way that's been sort of cemented in the national memory is a story of looting and disorder and mayhem. And this idea, I think, particularly of local communities really losing out from a kind of rampage of looting. But that's not how you see it, is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I think that because of this experience I had with working on these issues relating to policing of all of these young people, I kind of saw what took place in 2011. Maybe it could take with a different kind of perspective. I mean, 2011 was the year in which a reggae artist called Smarty Culture died during a raid on his home. It was the year in which we saw one of the largest community protests in Birmingham following the death of a young black man called Kinsey Burrell. And of course, the riots that began in Tottenham was sparked by the police killing of Mark Duggan. But what also of course, took place in the years leading up to it was a massive escalation in police searches using a power Code Section 60, which enables the police to stop and search people without requiring any reasonable suspicion. And so, while a lot of people were focusing on the destruction and the harm that was caused during those rebellions, for me, I was also thinking about the destruction and harm that had been caused by the forms of policing harassment, violence, arrest assaults, which was the prelude to those disturbances in which I think are problems which haven't been ameliorated at all in the years which have followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, there's a kind of interesting point there, I think, again, coming back to the idea of policing, because, as I said, a lot of the way it's been cemented in the national memory and talked about is just a story of looting, and not really about the origins of it at all. And undoubtedly, of course, there were businesses that were destroyed, there were items that were stolen, etc, etc. But then there's this whole kind of other story about the way that those crimes were policed afterwards and the types of sentences that were handed out and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I mean, a lot of people try to argue that these rights were not political, but clearly the value to them was deeply political, right, you know, state power and policing. But I think the aftermath was equally as political. And so I began to get involved in organisations, like the new monitoring projects in East London, or the Tottenham Defence Campaign in North London, which was helping people defend themselves against a massive escalation in arrests, raids on people's homes, instances of brutality and violence at the hands of the police, which not only was, I think, a quite a concerted effort to reestablish the existing order and reestablish the kind of policing which had led up to the rise of 2011. But also, I think, crucially, involved in intervention from central governments. And we saw people like David Cameron and other politicians make quite public statements, encouraging courts to disregard normal sentencing to treat the sentencing of people charged related offences with political punishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So before we get more stuck into the discussion, I just wanted to ask how you're defining racist policing, as the title of your book is &lt;em&gt;Black Resistance to British Policing&lt;/em&gt;. There I was wondering, can we say that there's white resistance to British policing, too? And can we say that not all policing is racist? Or is it that you're getting at something that's more structural? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So without getting too academic with people, I think it's useful to think about racism as not simply about prejudice, about there not being enough diversity, or enough training in the police force, but understanding racism is something which is institutional. So I would broadly define institutional racism as when the normal functioning of an institution produces racist outcomes. And what this means is that institutions like the police don't produce racist outcomes because there are prejudiced individuals working there who are flawed, or have some kind of unconscious bias deep within their psyche, which needs to be identified and routed out. So it's not because there aren't the kind of policies and practices necessary to ameliorate the issues in an otherwise fair system. He actually understands policing as something which is historically constituted as racist. So it understands racism as being fundamental to the foundations of both the British states and which is better understood, I think, as Imperial states rather than simply a nation state. And consequently, British policing, as most of British policing has taken place across Britain's colonies as much as it has on the British mainland. And thus, racism has been a fundamental component of British policing, for most of British policing history. And so I don't consider racism to be something which is an externality or a problem with policing, I think it&amp;rsquo;s policing functioning as it was intended to function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's interesting. And we'll get more into it later on the kind of Imperial roots of policing and the way that these structures are embedded into the state. For now, I wanted to ask as well about this idea of the &amp;ldquo;black folk devil&amp;rdquo; that's been present in public discourse for many years. I was actually thinking about when you were talking about the Tottenham riots and this idea of looting and mayhem and destruction and so on. But you talk about the mugger and the gangster, and so on. So I wondered what you mean by this term, the &amp;ldquo;black folk devil&amp;rdquo; and how that's been utilised recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think the &amp;ldquo;black folk devil&amp;rdquo; can maybe help us to better understand institutional racism. So there are two things here. The first is that mugging or gang crime or knife crime aren&amp;rsquo;t crimes in and of themselves. There's nothing really in the statute books about gang crime, specifically knife crime, specifically, muggings. Specifically, they are categories of crime. And what categories of crime do is they emerge at particular historical moments, the mugger emerges in the 1970s. Gang crime emerges in the 2000s; knife crime slightly later, and these categories of crime kind of vacuum up lots of existing forms of crime, creating the impression that there is a distinctively new and different problem. Very often this new purportedly different problem is attributed to a new and different people, and very often it's migrants and/or black communities. So are the racialized minorities for which these purportedly new social criminal problems are attributed we can think about other categories of crime, like terrorism, or immigration offences and what have you. But the other thing I think is really crucial about it is it helps us to better understand institutional racism. So let's think of example in relation to so-called gangs. There were two criminologist in Manchester who are really interested in looking at gang crime across the United Kingdom. And they realised that Manchester and London both have these gangs databases, which the police fill with the names of people they've identified as being affiliated with gangs or gang crime. And they also see broken down by ethnicity, and both the Metropolitan end and the Greater Manchester Police said, Yeah, sure, here you go. Here's the gangs database broken down by this thing, and then they then ask them, okay, so how do you define a gang member? And they said, one of the main ways they define them, are people involved in serious youth violence. This can be anything from very serious offences, like discharging a firearm, or attempted murder. So you'd less serious offences like common assaults, which is effectively spitting or shoving someone. And they said, What can we have all the young people you've identified as being involved in serious youth violence, and have that broken down by ethnicity, race. And what they found was that the vast majority of the people in the gangs databases were black or Asian, whereas the majority in Manchester of the CSU violence people were whites, young people, and when it came to London, it was 50-50, which is roughly proportionate of London's youth population. This tells us the criteria that police say they're using for identifying gang members is not the criteria that they are in fact using. And in fact, race is a far more salient indicator for who is or who isn't identified as being affiliated to a gang. Now, crucially, this isn't simply because the police are these terrible, bigoted, prejudiced, immoral people. Not that I don't think that's the case at all. I think this is an example of the normal functioning of policing, producing racist outcomes. And I think that the reason this is so endemic, is because racism has been fundamental to policing for the entire history of British policing that extends beyond the British mainland, across its colonies, through which race was the fundamental way of discerning who was immoral, and who was moral, who was criminal, and who was innocent, who was deviant and who was law abiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this term &amp;ldquo;folk devil&amp;rdquo; is from sociology, is that right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right. Yeah. So the &amp;ldquo;folk devil&amp;rdquo; is a term which I think was popularised by people like Stuart Hall in the 1970s. And lately was adopted by others like Paul Gilroy in the 1980s and 90s. And the idea of this, the folk devil, I guess, is a popular conception of deviance, a moral outcast, somebody who the law abiding so-called majority should feel fearful of, should feel under threat from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it's interesting, you argue that it's often tied to this supposed threat of black masculinity. So you've got the old colonial era stereotypes about black men being hyper sexualized. There's also Enoch Powell, in his notorious &amp;ldquo;Rivers of Blood&amp;rdquo; speech warning about black immigrants robbing old white women, and so on. And I wanted to ask about where black women are in all this. So one of the most moving things that I think you highlight is black women's role in resisting discriminatory aspects of policing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, so one of the things I noticed when I began my field research was I began working with lots of different campaigns, which were led by the families of people who had died at the hands of the police. And what became really apparent was that almost every single one of these campaigns was led by a woman. And so I began to ask people, why is it that you think that women lead all of these so many, almost all of these campaigns, and I think there are maybe two or three broad themes that I picked up. The first was that too often, when people die at the hands of the police, particularly black people, they are framed as being dysfunctional, as criminal, as deviant, as coming from quote, unquote, single parents households, which couldn't look after them properly, places that were chaotic, devoid of love. And I think that by presenting themselves, not as these militants would, chaotic activists, but instead as grieving parents, as mothers, sisters, as widows, I think enables a lot of these activists to win over sections of the press or members of the public or politicians or the court systems. But I think there's something else happening here as well, which I think is also really crucial. Because, while they do often present themselves as grieving mothers and what have you, maybe Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who is perhaps one of the most well known examples of this, these women are also politically critical, politically engaged, and many of them actually politically radical. And when I interview and speak to them, and their speeches at rallies and protests and public meetings, many of them draw on those histories of colonialism and slavery and talk about the role of women who are separated from their children for the violence of Empire. They talk about the other women who have been, who have come before them who fought against injustices and violence in the hands of the states. And crucially, they articulate a sense of family and belonging, not simply as being this kind of nuclear family structure, which has been torn apart by state violence, but actually family as being something that goes beyond bloodlines, or the nuclear family, which is a sense of solidarity, which is a sense of community, and family, which is a sense of, of collective resistance in collective care. And I thought that it was really a really powerful way of articulating a form of black feminism, which I think doesn't always identify itself as such, but I think is really marked by ways of understanding states and police violence is not simply about race and class, but also about gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's fascinating, because I think, much as you have all these stereotypes around black masculinity, as you say, these stereotypes around single parent families, or aggressive black women and so on are equally prevalent in our culture, aren't they? And this is what you're describing. And you know, that the kind of activism on the ground is so far removed from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I think you're completely right. And I think we've seen this in often an almost unspoken way through the kinds of policies and practices that mainstream governments has implemented. When we think about Boris Johnson's mentoring projects when he was London mayor, or when we think about the other kinds of projects which seek to mentor, young, particularly young black boys, but working class boys more generally, I think, who have been brought up in by just one parents, generally a mother, and apparently, being brought up by mother means that they haven't been imbued with the kind of moral values necessary that only a man can imbue, haven't been brought up with a strong sense of identity and self worth, that apparently only a man can offer them. And I think this kind of way, implicitly, I think degrades women and frames men as being the arbiters of morality and discipline and justice, both in the home and outside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I wanted to jump back to talking about knife crime. So you talked earlier about the gangs matrix, and the way that we talk about knife crime and serious youth violence is often very racialized in tone. So yeah, what do you think is wrong with the way we talk about knife crime? And I think one interesting comparison is between the way we talk about knife crime in London and Manchester, as you mentioned earlier, and the way we talk about it in Glasgow. iIt's something you go into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, yeah. So as I mentioned before, knife crime, of course, isn't a crime, right? It's a category of crime. And it's a category of crime which emerges as particular historical moments, maybe about 15-20 years ago or so, and has continually kind of expanded as we see more sections of the press or politicians or the police using this term. And what it can do is create the impression that this is a new problem and a problem which is increasing rapidly. But I think what's often the case, as well, as you mentioned, is that it's a category of crime which is racially charged. When we look at the images that are used on the television or listen to the commentary from people like Piers Morgan and others, we continually see race being associated with knife crime. And I think there are probably two or three problems with this. The first is that, of course, when we see crimes involving bladed implements being used in places like Glasgow, race isn't used to explain why it is we have these problems. So while even the United Nations has visited Glasgow and described it as one of the most violent cities in Europe, when this problem arises and is analysing Glasgow races and how we explain these issues, we see written questions of class, questions relating to addiction and poverty and inequality in housing and mental health, more often used in these kinds of context. But as soon as this question of knife crime becomes racialized, race becomes the explanatory factor. And I think the reason that racism is so important, therefore, isn't simply because it is empirically untrue that the vast majority of so-called knife crime in Britain is carried out by young black people. I think the real issue is how we explain an association between race and knife crime. And it's through race being the way in which we explain knife crime that I think the real problem arises. Because once we explain crime through race, rather than explaining crime through the facts that people live in conditions, which are more likely to breed these forms of violence, then we not only reproduce forms of racism, but we negate the underlying issues which leads to the issue of rising crime in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi there I'm Alice, I produce With Reason and today you're hearing Samira Shackle talking to the sociologist Adam Elliott-Cooper about racism, policing and resistance. If you want to hear more about that, go back to series two to catch Luke de Noronha talking about his work on Jamaica and the UK, his book &lt;em&gt;Deporting Black Britons&lt;/em&gt;. He talks a little bit more actually about this idea of being criminalised that Adam may have already been touching on here. And if you enjoy listening to With Reason, you'll love New Humanist magazine, a quarterly journal of ideas, science and culture.

And I think that probably goes beyond policing to this idea that racism is somehow much worse in America than it is in the UK. Or even that you shouldn't talk about racism and racist policing, in particular, in the US and in the UK in the same breath, because there's just no comparison at all. Why do you think that is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think that Britain is really good at creating the impression that racism is something that happens somewhere else; it's something that happens in the United States, it's something that happens in South Africa, or at least used to happen in South Africa. But here in Britain, we don't do race, right, we do class. And I think the reason Britain is able to reproduce this kind of self image is because for most of Britain's history it hasn't been doing race on the British mainland. For most of its history, it's been doing racism in its colonies across the Caribbean, the African continent, Australia, much of Asia, and, of course, much of the Middle East and elsewhere. And so I think because of this geographical barrier between where Britain has been doing race and the British mainland, it's able to kind of create this kind of conceptual barrier between where Britain resides, and where racism resides. And I think this is linked to an idea which people like Paul Gilroy, again, has talked about, which is this idea of colonial amnesia, because people talk about American racism as being totally unconnected and different to British racism, as if Britain and America are unconnected, as if people in America speak English, because of some weird quirk of history, because of some unexplained natural phenomenon, when in fact, of course, and the United States is, in many way, a creation of a number of European countries, but principally Britain. And so by looking through those histories of Empire, and how Empire is fundamental to the constitution of Britain, both historically, and today, we can better understand the role that the United States has played not as a completely separate entity, where a worse kind of racism has evolved in a completely distinct way to Britons, but actually how Britain and America's racism are historically linked throughout history, but also today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You talked earlier about how this history of racial discrimination and colonialism is built into British policing, sort of from its foundations. I wonder if you could talk a bit more about that. And also, is that something that's particular to policing? Are you talking more generally about the state?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's useful to understand Britain not as a nation-state, but as an imperial state. Britain has never existed, since it was established in 1707, without colonists, and racism has therefore always been fundamental to British governance, right? Across all of its institutions. I think policing is a particularly interesting one, because of the way in which we've seen policies, practices, and people from Britain's colonies migrate to the British mainland, bringing those policing policies and practices with them, right. So maybe one or two quick examples. Probably the most one of the most well known include Sir Kenneth Newman, who was head of the Metropolitan Police, brought in after the 1981 riots to deal with this problem of black youth and urban rebellion, and he cut his teeth really first in British Mandate Palestine as a police officer, but then gained his knighthood in Ireland where he had been responsible for handing over power from the British Army towhat became the Royal Ulster Constabulary. And so because of his experience in dealing with unruly natives and racialized others across these colonies, he was considered to be a suitable candidate for the role of a head of the best parts in police and with him. And during this time, more colonial policies are brought to the British mainland. So this included in 1981, for instance, for the first time on the British mainland, we see the use of tear gas, and other forms of poison gas, we see the colonial tactic of driving an armoured vehicle into crowds in order to disperse them which a young man lost his life in Toxteth in Liverpool. We see forms of armoured, policing and other forms of more militarised weaponry being used for the first time and in 1985, Sir Kenneth Newman actually brings baton rounds to the scene of Broadwater Farm in Tottenham, in North London again, the first time these have been brought to the scene of a civic disturbance on the British mainland. But these are all policing practices which had been used for many years in Britain's colonies in places like Malaya and Kenya, and Trinidad and Guyana, and Jamaica, and Ireland. And they were being brought to the British mainland, as people from Britain's colonies and former colonies were considered to have posed a different kind of threat, a specific kind of racial threat to Britain, and thus requiring a form of colonial governance in order to deal with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And your book, although this is all so kind of embedded into the state, the book and talking about resistance, I think it offers a kind of hope as well about the future. So I wondered what the alternative is to the type of policing that we have at the moment. So is it possible at all to build a more progressive police force if racism is so embedded into the state? And if so, how, what could we be doing differently?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over the last 30 or 40 years in this country, the prison population has almost doubled, the women's prison population has more than doubled. And we've seen the police expand in their ability to surveil our digital communications&amp;rsquo; use and other forms of power of surveillance, to impose injunctions upon people to stop them from seeing certain people and going to certain places, making music using social media, what have you. But we haven't seen a significant improvement in public safety. Public safety is still a major concern for many people. And a lot of the community organisations I worked with, during the course of my research, particularly those who were youth led, were seeking to find other ways of improving public safety. And for many of the young people we worked with, when we asked them, okay, so what does a safe community look like, a lot of them said, Well, I know that if I go to a suburban area, it's probably going to be pretty safe. And the reason it's safe isn't because there's a police officer on every corner, because everyone who lives in the middle class suburbs lives under the constant threat of incarceration, if they put a foot wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s because people in these middle class suburbs are more likely to have access to a good job, secure housing, access to education, and mental health provision if they need it, addiction services, all of the kinds of fundamental things that people need in order to live a healthy and prosperous existence. And if we continue to erode and not replace the public services, which have been defunded over the course of the last 15 years since the global financial crisis, but instead continue to expand our police and prison system, I think we're going to only continue to exacerbate the problems which led to the 2011 riots and also not really improve issue the issues of public safety, which I think everybody wants to address. And so I think that what a lot of community organisations are arguing, actually, is that we should be arguing for less policing, less reliance on prison power, because reliance on police and prisons I think, isn't the sign of a strong society, which certain political parties might tell you it is but actually is a sign of a weak society. And a stronger society relies less on police in prisons, and more on alternatives to that place in prison system - strong trade unions and renters unions for people to have better jobs and better housing, strong youth and community organisations for people to get the kinds of social support that they need, support for survivors of domestic violence and child abuse. All of these types of things, which, in some parts of the activist communities, they call &amp;ldquo;defunding the police&amp;rdquo; and investing in communities instead. And I think that these kinds of political visions try to construct a world in which we don't rely on police and prisons anymore. And I think this might be a utopian vision that we can't imagine, in our lifetimes, but I think it's something that a lot of communities are trying to work towards on a piecemeal basis, one community centre, one youth project at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, that phrase, that slogan &amp;ldquo;defunding the police&amp;rdquo;, I think is one that's quite often misunderstood. It seems to make people really angry in the mainstream a lot of the time. It's this idea that it's advocating for a lawless society. But that's not really what it is at all, is it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it has a lot more behind it. As you've just said, the people who are most likely to be the victims of violence or harm in our society are lower income communities, are very often racialized minorities. And the fact that these slogans and these ideas are coming out of these communities isn't therefore coming out of a place of ignorance, it&amp;rsquo;s coming out to a place that just said, Look, this law and order policing, this expansion of police and prison power is not working. And not only is it not working. It's actually oppressing us. One analogy that a friend of mine uses is, it's like having a leak in your roof, you call your landlord and ask the landlord to fix the leak in the roof. And they come to you with a bucket to catch the drips of water. And a month later, you ask them to fix the leak in the roof cause it got bigger, and they come back to your home with a bigger bucket. Of course, the bucket is useful whilst the roof is leaking, but it's not going to fix the root issue of what's causing that roof to leak and the water to drip into your home. So whilst it makes sense, in some ways, in the short term to get bigger and bigger buckets, in the longer term, what we really need to do is to fix that roof, what we really need is to fix the root causes of the kinds of social inequalities which lead to people coming into the context of the police and prison system in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we started off talking about institutional racism. And that's been been a sort of intimate point of discussion for decades now in the UK. And I think often when there's a discussion about solutions in the public sphere, at least, it's about, it kind of comes down to seeking greater diversity in institutions like the police. So promoting more black officers, having more black people in leadership positions and so on. You're critical of this idea that diversity is the answer. So maybe you could tell me about that and what you think better, more effective action would look like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we've seen the kind of liberal demands for diversity become increasingly popular over the last 30 or 20 or 30 years, and I think probably reached a crescendo in this country with the McPherson report, which demanded a massive increase in police diversity, and of course, probably reaching an even greater crescendo in the United States with the election of Barack Obama. And it's in these two contexts that we see the fact that actually police violence and police racism hasn't improved at all. And I think the reason that people thought that this kind of representation could work is perhaps slightly out of what can only really be a historical naivety. Because of course, Britain has been doing diversity initiatives for a very long time. But it hasn't been doing it on the British mainland. It did diversity initiatives in places like Rhodesia, in Nigeria, and Kenya. It did diversity initiatives in Jamaica and Guyana and Trinidad in India and Malaysia, because it had to recruit people from the colonised populations into their police forces and their court systems and their educational institutions and, and other systems of power and governance and control. And what we saw in all of these contexts was, as Franz Fanon and others have articulated so well, was the reproduction of the same systems of power, but with a few black faces in high places. And I think perhaps therefore, we should be unsurprised that those same patterns of inequality had been reproduced today. And maybe the most vivid example of this is this current conservative governments, which has one of the most ethnically diverse cabinets in British history and of course has its very well known commission for racial, racial and ethnic disparities where much like the colonial administrators of yesteryear have recruited people from the colonised or racialised populations into its systems of power to only continue the very same systems of institutional racism for which anti racists have demanded change for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we've been speaking just now about this idea of diversity, both in things like police recruitment, and more generally. And in recent years, we've seen quite a few books from people like Reni Eddo Lodge and Robyn D'Angelo, which explicitly reference white people in their titles. So, Eddo Lodge&amp;rsquo;s book is &lt;em&gt;Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race&lt;/em&gt; and d&amp;rsquo;Angelo's book is &lt;em&gt;White Fragility&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Why It's So Hard For White People To Talk About Racism&lt;/em&gt;. Those are just two examples. But people seem to get quite angry about this idea that whiteness is an identity in itself. It&amp;rsquo;s something that we explored in the magazine in New Humanists back in 2017. And so Adam, why do you think that people get so angry at the suggestion that whiteness is an identity that's worthy of examination?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think that very often whiteness is considered the default human being to which all other human beings are compared. Whiteness is the Greenwich Meantime of human dispositions; it is the centre of our social world. And I think that's therefore making it visible, and can often make people feel uncomfortable because it's so often it is actually invisible. But I think what&amp;rsquo;s also really crucial is that the work that people like Ron were doing, I think, situates whiteness, not as something which is simply embodied in all white people as Robyn D'Angelo does, but something which is historically constituted, which is something which is a historical invention. And therefore, if it's something which is had been historically invented, I, at one point, people, European people decided to begin identifying themselves as white in order to differentiate themselves from the peoples that they were colonising, which they were racializing, as, as red or black, or brown, or what have you. This means that we can also dismantle these identities, this means we can also dismantle these categories. And I think that's really crucial for one or two reasons. The first, of course, is that it means that racism is something that everybody is implicated in, in one way or another. But it also I think, helps us to better understand how people are exploited differently and divided through these racial categories. It creates the impression that a lower income working class person who identifies as white has more in common with Piers Morgan, or Boris Johnson, or Jeremy Clarkson, than they do with their Asian neighbour, or their black coworker. And so what this also does, of course, is obscures the way in which people have commonalities in the way in which they're exploited or experienced oppression, and creates what WEB Du Bois called a &amp;ldquo;wage of whiteness&amp;rdquo;, where people who are racialized as white can say, well, I might be exploited at work, and I might be harassed on the streets, and I might be worried about my pension and whether my children are going to get a home, but at least I can, in some immaterial, intangible way, identify with this idea of whiteness, and all of the people that it represents, whether that be the royal family, or the people who run governments or other ideas or institutions of influence and notoriety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I was thinking of, in I think it was in 2019, when Jon Snow was presenting on Channel Four, and he referred to there being a lot of white people at a pro-Brexit rally, and there were loads of complaints to Ofcom about it just for using that term. And I wondered if things have moved on since then. We obviously last year had the massive Black Lives Matters protests, both in the UK and around the world. Are we thinking about whiteness more or examining it more? In general, I don't know about in academia where you are, or sort of more generally, in public discourse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what's happened with Jon Snow was really interesting because it helps us to differentiate between white people and whiteness. So when Jon Snow identifies a Brexit rally, and says there's lots of white people here, what he's really identifying is whiteness, it's people really kind of using their whiteness to engage in a political project. But what I saw in the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 were Black Lives Matter protests in small towns and villages across England and Wales and Scotland, which had maybe never seen an anti racist mobilisation before. And were almost exclusively white. But when I saw people, white people coming out in places that didn't have very much ethnic diversity, I didn't see them doing whiteness, I saw them actually pushing back against this idea that whiteness is how people should identify. And therefore, racism, anti racism is something that other people should be invested in. And in fact, I think they were pushing against whiteness, and the kind of political projects like Brexit, which have sought to mobilise whiteness to divide different people across countries like Britain. So I think that differentiating between white people and whiteness, I think has become so crucial over the last few years, as more and more people racialized as white have become invested in anti racist struggle not only through the kinds of rallies and mobilisation that we saw in 2020, but also through the new anti racist organisations like Anti Racist Cumbria, for instance, which has come out of the protest movements in 2020, which is made up of huge number of white people. But they aren't I think invested in whiteness in the way in which the Brexit protests that Jon Snow identified all those years ago and gotten all that trouble for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think the exact quote from Jon Snow was that he had never seen so many white people in one place. Anyway, thank you, Adam. Elliott-Cooper, thanks so much for sharing all of that with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AEC:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thank you so much for having me on. Really appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Elliott-Cooper discussing his book &lt;em&gt;Black Resistance to British Policing&lt;/em&gt;. Our producer Alice is with me now. So Alice, some of the themes that we touched on there have echoes of the interview that you did with Luke de Noronha in series two, which was about his book &lt;em&gt;Deporting Black Britons&lt;/em&gt;. So what struck you listening to Adam there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it's interesting, isn't it? I mean, Luke is actually a sociologist just like Adam is, and one of the reasons I really like sociology is that it complicates this idea of the individual. And I really liked how Adam kind of goes beyond the interpersonal, which, of course, is really still important, and I think he would acknowledge that, but he goes beyond that, and focuses on the state and he says, you know, this is structural, this isn't an externality, it's part of our story, it's part of a kind of very deep embedded history that probably is so deeply embedded that a lot of us are actually blind to it, you know. His point on that reminds me of Orwell's writing on Burma. Also, though, you know, he may be a sociologist, but his work, or at least his conversation with you there, reminds me of contract theory and politics - this idea that, you know, you kind of enter into a bit of a bargain with the state, you accept the authority of the state, because ultimately, the state on balance is going to provide you with some kind of security, it's going to protect you. And it's probably better than if you're just outside of it on your own. And that's, you know, so-called state of nature, etc. But obviously, actually, as feminists have argued, re women in the state, what happens if the state doesn't protect you? What happens if you feel that the state isn't really made in your name? And that's something that Adam is pointing to, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that point about the individual and the state is really an interesting one, you see it a lot with the way that the concept of white privilege is talked about and how it's become very controversial. In the media, it's almost like a culture war point. I think that's actually a term that originated to diagnose a structural problem, but it often ends up in a sort of defensiveness, I think, of people saying, you know, I don't have privileges just because I'm white, looking at all these ways in which I'm disadvantaged. And that sort of misses the point, I think, because it's a way of talking about racialized structures and differences and so on. But when it kind of comes down to this individual level, I think there can be a reflexive defensiveness. So yeah, it's, I think, very useful to have more focus on the structures and the histories that we're all operating within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, certainly. And actually another word that people get very kind of, I guess, if not defensive, but rather stirred and angry by at all ends of the political spectrum is this term &amp;ldquo;diversity&amp;rdquo; that you and Adam also talked about. That reminds me of one book I'd love to read. It's from a little while ago, still certainly relevant, though, I think it's called &lt;em&gt;On Being Included&lt;/em&gt; by the feminist Sara Ahmed. And that book is about kind of what happens when diversity is put forward as a so-called solution in institutions, you know, higher education, for example. And really, she talks about how, you know, racism, quote, can be obscured by the institutionalisation of diversity. So that's just a reminder really, that, you know, diversity, we really have to probe what's going on when someone raises that word, I guess, especially in a corporate context, it's something that I'm thinking about a bit at the moment reading a novel by Natasha Brown called &lt;em&gt;Assembly&lt;/em&gt;, which is very much on that on that subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I think you've seen this argument play out, as you say, with feminism as well, this whole idea of women in boardrooms being an end goal in and of itself. And what Adam was talking about with having more black officers in the police, for instance, in senior roles. And I guess the thing is, it's not a bad aim to have that. But if it's purely symbolic, and those people aren't given the tools to sort of bring about the cultural change, which is actually what you need, then it's a bit of a sticking plaster solution, I guess. It's not an end goal in itself. Also, if the kind of real burden is put on those individuals only to be the generators of change, then that's not really fair either. That's kind of reducing them to one dimension of their identity. And that would be an incredibly exhausting position to have to be in. It would involve a lot of work on top of your work. Yeah, a whole other issue. And so not not the most positive place to end but as I said, Adam&amp;rsquo;s book in documenting the kind of community resistance that's happening all around the UK and has happened through history does offer notes of hope.

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person’s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children’s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children’s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

    <title>Good Magic Award</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/good-magic-award-2/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To enter, please head over to &lt;a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Good Thinking Society&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can We Pull Back From The Brink?</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://samharris.org/can-pull-back-brink/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this episode of the podcast, Sam discusses the recent social protests and civil unrest, in light of what we know about racism and police violence in America.</p>
<p>This is a transcript of a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/207-can-pull-back-brink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded podcast</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Welcome to the Making Sense podcast… This is Sam Harris.</p>
<p>OK…. Well, I’ve been trying to gather my thoughts for this podcast for more than a week—and have been unsure about whether to record it at all, frankly.</p>
<p>Conversation is the only tool we have for making progress, I firmly believe that. But many of the things we most need to talk about, seem impossible to talk about.</p>
<p>I think social media is a huge part of the problem. I’ve been saying for a few years now that, with social media, we’ve all been enrolled in a psychological experiment for which no one gave consent, and it’s not at all clear how it will turn out. And it’s still not clear how it will turn out, but it’s not looking good. It’s fairly disorienting out there. All information is becoming weaponized. All communication is becoming performative. And on the most important topics, it now seems to be fury and sanctimony and bad faith almost all the time.</p>
<p>We appear to be driving ourselves crazy. Actually, crazy. As in, incapable of coming into contact with reality, unable to distinguish fact from fiction—and then becoming totally destabilized by our own powers of imagination, and confirmation bias, and then lashing out at one other on that basis.</p>
<p>So I’d like to talk about the current moment and the current social unrest, and its possible political implications, and other cultural developments, and suggest what it might take to pull back from the brink here. I’m going to circle in on the topics of police violence and the problem of racism, because that really is at the center of this. There is so much to talk about here, and it’s so difficult to talk about. And there is so much we don’t know. And yet, most people are behaving as though every important question was answered a long time ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching our country seem to tear itself apart for weeks now, and perhaps lay the ground for much worse to come. And I’ve been resisting the temptation to say anything of substance—not because I don’t have anything to say, but because of my perception of the danger, frankly. And if that’s the way I feel, given the pains that I’ve taken to insulate myself from those concerns, I know that almost everyone with a public platform is terrified. Journalists, and editors, and executives, and celebrities are terrified that they might take one wrong step here, and never recover.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdsmxzaHtSQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"/></p>
<p>And this is really unhealthy—not just for individuals, but for society. Because, again, all we have between us and the total breakdown of civilization is a series of successful conversations. If we can’t reason with one another, there is no path forward, other than violence. Conversation or violence.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to talk about some of the things that concern me about the current state of our communication. Unfortunately, many things are compounding our problems at the moment. We have a global pandemic which is still very much with us. And it remains to be seen how much our half-hearted lockdown, and our ineptitude in testing, and our uncoordinated reopening, and now our plunge into social protest and civil unrest will cause the Covid-19 caseload to spike. We will definitely see. As many have pointed out, the virus doesn’t care about economics or politics. It only cares that we keep breathing down each other’s necks. And we’ve certainly been doing enough of that.</p>
<p>Of course, almost no one can think about Covid-19 right now. But I’d just like to point out that many of the costs of this pandemic and the knock-on effects in the economy, and now this protest movement, many of these costs are hidden from us. In addition to killing more than 100,000 people in the US, the pandemic has been a massive opportunity cost. The ongoing implosion of the economy is imposing tangible costs, yes, but it is also a massive opportunity cost. And now this civil unrest is compounding those problems—whatever the merits of these protests may be or will be, the opportunity costs of this moment are staggering. In addition to all the tangible effects of what’s happening—the injury and death, the lost businesses, the burned buildings, the neighborhoods that won’t recover for years in many cities, the educations put on hold, and the breakdown in public trust of almost every institution—just think about all the good and important things we cannot do—cannot even <em>think</em> of doing now—and perhaps won’t contemplate doing for many years to come, because we’ll be struggling to get back to that distant paradise we once called “normal life.”</p>
<p>Of course, normal life for many millions of Americans was nothing like a paradise. The disparities in wealth and health and opportunity that we have gotten used to in this country, and that so much of our politics and ways of doing business seem to take for granted, are just unconscionable. There is no excuse for this kind of inequality in the richest country on earth. What we’re seeing now is a response to that. But it’s a confused and confusing response. Worse, it’s a response that is systematically silencing honest conversation. And this makes it dangerous.</p>
<p>This isn’t just politics and human suffering on display. It’s philosophy. It’s ideas about truth—about what it means to say that something is “true.” What we’re witnessing in our streets and online and in the impossible conversations we’re attempting to have in our private lives is a breakdown in epistemology. How does anyone figure out what’s going on in the world? What is real? If we can’t agree about what is real, or likely to be real, we will never agree about how we should live together. And the problem is, we’re stuck with one other.</p>
<p>So, what’s happening here?</p>
<p>Well, again, it’s hard to say. What is happening when <a href="https://youtu.be/viika57hTO4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a police officer or a mayor takes a knee</a> in front of a crowd of young people who have been berating him for being a cog in the machinery of systemic racism? Is this a profound moment of human bonding that transcends politics, or is it the precursor to the breakdown of society? Or is it both? It’s not entirely clear.</p>
<p>In the most concrete terms, we are experiencing widespread social unrest in response to what is widely believed to be an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at the black community by racist cops and racist policies. And this unrest has drawn a counter-response from law enforcement—much of which, ironically, is guaranteed to exacerbate the problem of police violence, both real and perceived. And many of the videos we’ve seen of the police cracking down on peaceful protesters are hideous. Some of this footage has been unbelievable. And this is one of many vicious circles that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>Again, there is so much to be confused about here. We’ve now seen endless video of police inflicting senseless violence on truly peaceful protesters, and yet we have also seen video of the police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrVp8vlQyU">standing idly by</a> while looters completely destroy businesses. What explains this? Is there a policy that led to this bizarre inversion of priorities? Are the police angry at the protesters for vilifying them, and simultaneously trying to teach society a lesson by letting crime and mayhem spread elsewhere in the city? Or is it just less risky to collide with peaceful protesters? Or is the whole spectacle itself a lie? How representative are these videos of what’s actually going on? Is there much less chaos actually occurring than is being advertised to us?</p>
<p>Again, it’s very hard to know.</p>
<p>What’s easy to know is that civil discourse has broken down. It seems to me that we’ve long been in a situation where the craziest voices on both ends of the political spectrum have been amplifying one another and threatening to produce something truly dangerous. And now I think they have. The amount of misinformation in the air—the degree to which even serious people seem to be ruled by false assumptions and non sequiturs—is just astonishing.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep in mind that, with the presidential election coming in November, the stakes are really high. As most of you know, I consider four more years of Trump to be an existential threat to our democracy. And I believe that the last two weeks have been very good for him, politically, even when everything else seemed to go very badly for him. I know the polls don’t say this. A large majority of people disapprove of his handling this crisis so far. But I think we all know now to take polls with a grain of salt. There is the very real problem of preference falsification—especially in an environment of intense social pressure. People will often say what they think is socially acceptable, and then think, or say, or do something very different in private—like when they’re alone in a voting booth.</p>
<p>Trump has presided over the complete dismantling of American influence in the world and the destruction of our economy. I know the stock market has looked good, but the stock market has become totally uncoupled from the economy. According to the stock market, the future is just as bright now as it was in January of this year, before most of us had even heard of a novel coronavirus. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. And a lot can happen in the next few months. The last two weeks feel like a decade. And my concern is that if Trump now gets to be the law-and-order President, that may be his path to re-election, if such a path exists. Of course, this crisis has revealed, yet again, how unfit he is to be President. The man couldn’t strike a credible note of reconciliation if the fate of the country depended on it—and the fate of the country has depended on it. I also think it’s possible that these protests wouldn’t be happening, but for the fact that Trump is President. Whether or not the problem of racism has gotten worse in our society, having Trump as President surely makes it seem like it has. It has been such a repudiation of the Obama presidency that, for many people, it has made it seem that white supremacy is now ascendant. So, all the more reason to get rid of Trump in November.</p>
<p>But before this social unrest, our focus was on how incompetent Trump was in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. And now he has been given a very different battle to fight. A battle against leftwing orthodoxy, which is growing more stifling by the minute, and civil unrest. If our social order frays sufficiently, restoring it will be the only thing that most people care about in November. Just think of what an act of domestic terrorism would do politically now. Things can change very, very quickly. And to all a concern for basic law and order “racist”, isn’t going to wash.</p>
<p>Trust in institutions has totally broken down. We’ve been under a very precarious quarantine for more than 3 months, which almost the entire medical profession has insisted is necessary. Doctors and public health officials have castigated people on the political Right for protesting this lockdown. People have been unable to be with their loved ones in their last hours of life. They’ve been unable to hold funerals for them. But now we have doctors and public officials by the thousands, signing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letters</a>, making public statements, saying it’s fine to stand shoulder to shoulder with others in the largest protests our nation has ever seen. The degree to which this has undermined confidence in public health messaging is hard to exaggerate. Whatever your politics, this has been just a mortifying piece of hypocrisy. Especially so, because the pandemic has been hitting the African American community hardest of all. How many people will die because of these protests? It’s a totally rational question to ask, but the question itself is taboo now.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that almost everything appears upside down at the moment.</p>
<p>Before I get into details on police violence, first let me try to close the door to a few misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the proximate cause of all this: The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. I’ll have more to say about this in a minute, but nothing I say should detract from the following observation: That <a href="https://youtu.be/vksEJR9EPQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> was absolutely sickening, and it revealed a degree of police negligence and incompetence and callousness that everyone was right to be horrified by. In particular, the actions of Derek Chauvin, the cop who kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes, his actions were so reckless and so likely to cause harm that there’s no question he should be prosecuted. And he is being prosecuted. He’s been indicted for 2nd degree murder and manslaughter, and I suspect he will spend many, many years in prison. And, this is not to say “the system is working.” It certainly seems likely that without the cell phone video, and the public outrage, Chauvin might have gotten away with it—to say nothing of the other cops with him, who are also now being prosecuted. If this is true, we clearly need a better mechanism with which to police the police.</p>
<p>So, as I said, I’ll return to this topic, because I think most people are drawing the wrong conclusions from this video, and from videos like it, but let me just echo everyone’s outrage over what happened. This is precisely the kind of police behavior that everyone should find abhorrent.</p>
<p>On the general topic of racism in America, I want to make a few similarly clear, preemptive statements:</p>
<p>Racism is still a problem in American society. No question. And slavery—which was racism’s most evil expression—was this country’s founding sin. We should also add the near-total eradication of the Native Americans to that ledger of evil. Any morally sane person who learns the details of these historical injustices finds them shocking, whatever their race. And the legacy of these crimes—crimes that were perpetrated for centuries—remains a cause for serious moral concern today. I have no doubt about this. And nothing I’m about to say, should suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>And I don’t think it’s an accident that the two groups I just mentioned, African Americans and Native Americans, suffer the worst from inequality in America today. How could the history of racial discrimination in this country not have had lasting effects, given the nature of that history? And if anything good comes out of the current crisis, it will be that we manage to find a new commitment to reducing inequality in all its dimensions. The real debate to have is about how to do this, economically and politically. But the status quo that many of us take for granted to is a betrayal of our values, whether we realize it or not. If it’s not a betrayal or your values now, it will be a betrayal of your values when you become a better person. And if you don’t manage that, it will be a betrayal of your kid’s values when they’re old enough to understand the world they are living in. The difference between being very lucky in our society, and very unlucky, should not be as enormous as it is.</p>
<p>However, the question that interests me, given what has been true of the past and is now true of the present, is what should we do next? What should we do to build a healthier society?</p>
<p>What should we do next?  Tomorrow… next week…. Obviously, I don’t have the answers. But I am very worried that many of the things we’re doing now, and seem poised to do, will only make our problems worse. And I’m especially worried that it has become so difficult to talk about this. I’m just trying to have conversations. I’m just trying to figure these things out in real time, with other people. And there is no question that conversation itself has become dangerous.</p>
<p>Think about the politics of this. Endless imagery of people burning and looting independent businesses that were struggling to survive, and seeing the owners of these businesses beaten by mobs, cannot be good for the cause of social justice. Looting and burning businesses, and assaulting their owners, isn’t social justice, or even social protest. It’s crime. And having imagery of these crimes that highlight black involvement circulate endlessly on Fox News and on social media cannot be good for the black community. But it might yet be good for Trump.</p>
<p>And it could well kick open the door to a level of authoritarianism that many of us who have been very worried about Trump barely considered possible. It’s always seemed somewhat paranoid to me to wonder whether we’re living in Weimar Germany. I’ve had many conversations about this. I had <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-road-to-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Snyder on the podcast</a>, who’s been worrying about the prospect of tyranny in the US for several years now. I’ve known, in the abstract, that democracies can destroy themselves. But the idea that it could happen here still seemed totally outlandish to me. It doesn’t anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, what we’ve been seeing in the streets isn’t just one thing. Some people are protesting for reasons that I fully defend. They’re outraged by specific instances of police violence, like the killing of George Floyd, and they’re worried about creeping authoritarianism—which we really should be worried about now. And they’re convinced that our politics is broken, because it is broken, and they are deeply concerned that our response to the pandemic and the implosion of our economy will do nothing to address the widening inequality in our society. And they recognize that we have a President who is an incompetent, divisive, conman and a crackpot at a time when we actually need wise leadership.</p>
<p>All of that is hard to put on a sign, but it’s all worth protesting.</p>
<p>However, it seems to me that most protesters are seeing this moment exclusively through the lens of identity politics—and racial politics in particular. And some of them are even celebrating the breakdown of law and order, or at least remaining nonjudgmental about it. And you could see, in the early days of this protest, news anchors take that line, on CNN, for instance. Talking about the history of social protest, “Sometimes it has to be violent, right? What, do you think all of these protests need to be nonviolent?” Those words came out of Chris Cuomo’s mouth, and Don Lemon’s mouth. Many people have been circulating a half quote from Martin Luther King Jr. about riots being “the language of the unheard.” They’re <a href="https://youtu.be/pjYZZC5i_AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving out the part</a> where he made it clear that he believed riots harmed the cause of the black community and helped the cause of racists.</p>
<p>There are now calls to defund and even to abolish the police. This may be psychologically understandable when you’ve spent half your day on Twitter watching videos of cops beating peaceful protesters. Those videos are infuriating. And I’ll have a lot more to say about police violence in a minute. But if you think a society without cops is a society you would want to live in, you have lost your mind. Giving a monopoly on violence to the state is just about the best thing we have ever done as a species. It ranks right up there with keeping our shit out of our food. Having a police force that can deter crime, and solve crimes when they occur, and deliver violent criminals to a functioning justice system, is the necessary precondition for almost anything else of value in society.</p>
<p>We need police reform, of course. There are serious questions to ask about the culture of policing—its hiring practices, training, the militarization of so many police forces, outside oversight, how police departments deal with corruption, the way the police unions keep bad cops on the job, and yes, the problem of racist cops. But the idea that any serious person thinks we can do without the police—or that less trained and less vetted cops will magically be better than more trained and more vetted ones—this just reveals that our conversation on these topics has run completely off the rails. Yes, we should give more resources to community services. We should have psychologists or social workers make first contact with the homeless or the mentally ill. Perhaps we’re giving cops jobs they shouldn’t be doing. All of that makes sense to rethink. But the idea that what we’re witnessing now is a matter of the cops being over-resourced—that we’ve given them too much training, that we’ve made the job too attractive—so that the people we’re recruiting are of too high a quality. That doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>What’s been alarming here is that we’re seeing prominent people—in government, in media, in Hollywood, in sports—speak and act as though the breakdown of civil society, and of society itself, is a form of progress and any desire for law enforcement is itself a form of racist oppression. At one point the woman who’s running the City Council in Minneapolis, which just decided to abolish the police force, was asked by a journalist, I believe on CNN, “What do I do if someone’s breaking into my house in the middle of the night? Who do I call?” And her first response to that question was, “You need to recognize what a statement of privilege that question is.” She’s since had to walk that back, because it’s one of the most galling and embarrassing things a public official has ever said, but this is how close the Democratic Party is to sounding completely insane. You cannot say that if someone is breaking into your house, and you’re terrified, and you want a police force that can respond, that fear is a symptom of “white privilege.” This is where Democratic politics goes to die.</p>
<p>Again, what is alarming about this is that this woke analysis of the breakdown of law and order will only encourage an increasingly authoritarian response, as well as the acceptance of that response by many millions of Americans.</p>
<p>If you step back, you will notice that there is a kind of ecstasy of ideological conformity in the air. And it’s destroying institutions. It’s destroying the very institutions we rely on to get our information—universities, the press. The New York Times in recent days, seems to be preparing for a self-immolation in recent days. No one wants to say or even think anything that makes anyone uncomfortable—certainly not anyone who has more wokeness points than they do. It’s just become too dangerous. There are people <a href="https://wwos.nine.com.au/news/nba-announcer-fired-over-controversial-all-lives-matter-tweet/a9a50198-4b52-4cb7-a800-e0ffacb3302d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being fired</a> for tweeting “All Lives Matter.” #AllLivesMatter, in the current environment, is being read as a naked declaration of white supremacy. That is how weird this moment is. A soccer player on the LA Galaxy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/rowdies/2020/06/05/la-galaxy-releases-player-after-wifes-racist-and-violent-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fired</a> for something his wife tweeted…</p>
<p>Of course, there are real problems of inequality and despair at the bottom of these protests. People who have never found a secure or satisfying place in the world—or young people who fear they never will—people who have seen their economic prospects simply vanish, and people who have had painful encounters with racism and racist cops—people by the millions are now surrendering themselves to a kind of religious awakening. But like most religious awakenings, this movement is not showing itself eager to make honest contact with reality.</p>
<p>On top of that, we find extraordinarily privileged people, whatever the color of their skin—people who have been living wonderful lives in their gated communities or 5<sup>th</sup> avenue apartments—and who feel damn guilty about it—they are supporting this movement uncritically, for many reasons. Of course, they care about other people—I’m sure most of them have the same concerns about inequality that I do—but they are also supporting this movement because it promises a perfect expiation of their sins. If you have millions of dollars, and shoot botox into your face, and vacation on St. Bart’s, and you’re liberal—the easiest way to sleep at night is to be as woke as AOC and like every one of her tweets.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just with the looting, and the arson, and the violence. There are problems with these peaceful protests themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not questioning anyone’s right to protest. Even our deranged president can pay lip service to that right—which he did as the DC police were violently dispersing a peaceful protest so that he could get his picture taken in front of that church, awkwardly holding a bible, as though he had never held a book in life.</p>
<p>The problem with the protests is that they are animated, to a remarkable degree, by confusion and misinformation. And I’ll explain why I think that’s the case. And, of course, this will be controversial. Needless to say, many people will consider the color of my skin to be disqualifying here. I could have invited any number of great, black intellectuals onto the podcast to make these points for me. But that struck me as a form of cowardice. Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Coleman Hughes, Kmele Foster, these guys might not agree with everything I’m about to say, but any one of them could walk the tightrope I’m now stepping out on far more credibly than I can.</p>
<p>But, you see, that’s part of the problem. The perception that the color of a person’s skin, or even his life experience, matters for this discussion is a pernicious illusion. For the discussion we really need to have, the color of a person’s skin, and even his life experience, simply does not matter. It cannot matter. We have to break this spell that the politics of identity has cast over everything.</p>
<p>Ok…</p>
<p>As I’ve already acknowledged, there is a legacy of racism in the United States that we’re still struggling to outgrow. That is obvious. There are real racists out there. And there are ways in which racism became institutionalized long ago. Many of you will remember that during the crack epidemic the penalties for crack and powder cocaine were quite different. And this led black drug offenders to be locked up for much longer than white ones. Now, whether the motivation for that policy was consciously racist or not, I don’t know, but it was effectively racist. Nothing I’m about to say entails a denial of these sorts of facts. There just seems to be no question that boys who grow up with their fathers in prison start life with a significant strike against them. So criminal justice reform is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>And I’m not denying that many black people, perhaps most, have interactions with cops, and others in positions of power, or even random strangers, that seem unambiguously racist. Sometimes this is because they are actually in the presence of racism, and perhaps sometimes it only seems that way. I’ve had unpleasant encounters with cops, and customs officers, and TSA screeners, and bureaucrats of every kind, and even with people working in stores or restaurants. People aren’t always nice or ethical. But being white, and living in a majority white society, I’ve never had to worry about whether any of these collisions were the result of racism. And I can well imagine that in some of these situations, had I been black, I would have come away feeling that I had encountered yet another racist in the wild. So I consider myself very lucky to have gone through life not having to think about any of that. Surely that’s one form of white privilege.</p>
<p>So, nothing I’m going to say denies that we should condemn racism—whether interpersonal or institutional—and we should condemn it wherever we find it. But as a society, we simply can’t afford to find and condemn racism where it doesn’t exist. And we should be increasingly aware of the costs of doing that. The more progress we make on issues of race, the less racism there will be to find, and the more likely we’ll find ourselves chasing after its ghost.</p>
<p>The truth is, we have made considerable progress on the problem of racism in America. This isn’t 1920, and it isn’t 1960. We had a two-term black president. We have black congressmen and women. We have black mayors and black chiefs of police. There are major cities, like Detroit and Atlanta, going on their fifth or sixth consecutive black mayor. Having more and more black people in positions of real power, in what is still a majority white society, is progress on the problem of racism. And the truth is, it might not even solve the problem we’re talking about. When Freddy Gray was killed in Baltimore, virtually everyone who could have been held accountable for his death was black. The problem of police misconduct and reform is complicated, as we’re about to see. But obviously, there is more work to do on the problem of racism. And, more important, there is much more work to do to remedy the inequalities in our society that are so correlated with race, and will still be correlated with race, even after the last racist has been driven from our shores.</p>
<p>The question of how much of today’s inequality is due to existing racism—whether racist people or racist policies—is a genuinely difficult question to answer. And to answer it, we need to distinguish the past from the present.</p>
<p>Take wealth inequality, for example: The median white family has a net worth of around $170,000—these data are a couple of years old, but they’re probably pretty close to what’s true now. The median black family has a net worth of around $17,000. So we have a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/06/18/a-conversation-about-the-racial-wealth-gap-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenfold difference in median wealth</a>. (That’s the median, not the mean: Half of white families are below 170,000 and half above; half of black families are below 17,000 and half above. And we’re talking about wealth here, not income.)</p>
<p>This disparity in wealth persists even for people whose incomes are in the top 10 percent of the income distribution. For whites in the top 10 percent for income, the median net worth is $1.8 million; for blacks it’s around $350,000. There are probably many things that account for this disparity in wealth. It seems that black families that make it to the top of the income distribution fall out of it more easily than white families do. But it’s also undeniable that black families have less intergenerational wealth accumulated through inheritance.</p>
<p>How much of this is inequality due to the legacy of slavery? And how much of it is due to an ensuing century of racist policies? I’m prepared to believe quite a lot. And it strikes me as totally legitimate to think about paying reparations as a possible remedy here. Of course, one will then need to talk about reparations for the Native Americans. And then one wonders where this all ends. And what about blacks who aren’t descended from slaves, but who still suffered the consequences of racism in the US? In listening to people like <a href="https://youtu.be/FXt9Q5h1sCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McWhorter</a> and Coleman Hughes discuss this topic, I’m inclined to think that reparations is probably unworkable as a policy. But the truth is that I’m genuinely unsure about this.</p>
<p>Whatever we decide about the specific burdens of the past, we have to ask, how much of current wealth inequality is due to existing racism and to existing policies that make it harder for black families to build wealth? And the only way to get answers to those questions is to have a dispassionate discussion about facts.</p>
<p>The problem with the social activism we are now seeing—what John McWhorter has called “the new religion of anti-Racism”—is that it finds racism nearly everywhere, even where it manifestly does not exist. And this is incredibly damaging to the cause of achieving real equality in our society. It’s almost impossible to exaggerate the evil and injustice of slavery and its aftermath. But it is possible to exaggerate how much racism currently exists at an Ivy League university, or in Silicon Valley, or at the Oscars. And those exaggerations are toxic—and, perversely, they may produce more real racism. It seems to me that false claims of victimhood can diminish the social stature of any group, even a group that has a long history of real victimization.</p>
<p>The imprecision here—the bad-faith arguments, the double standards, the goal-post shifting, the <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hrFzz1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idiotic opinion pieces</a> in the New York Times, the defenestrations on social media, the general hysteria that the cult of wokeness has produced—I think this is all extremely harmful to civil society, and to effective liberal politics, and to the welfare of African Americans.</p>
<p>So, with that as preamble, let’s return to the tragic death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>As I said, I believe that any sane person who watches that video will feel that they have witnessed a totally unjustified killing. So, people of any race, are right to be horrified by what happened there. But now I want to ask a few questions, and I want us to try to consider them dispassionately. And I really want you to watch your mind while you do this. There are very likely to be few tripwires installed there, and I’m about to hit them. So just do your best to remain calm.</p>
<p>Does the killing of George Floyd prove that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>Does it even suggest that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>In other words, do we have reason to believe that, had Floyd been white, he wouldn’t have died in a similar way?</p>
<p>Do the dozen or so other videos that have emerged in recent years, of black men being killed by cops, do they prove, or even suggest, that there is an epidemic of lethal police violence directed especially at black men and that this violence is motivated by racism?</p>
<p>Most people seem to think that the answers to these questions are so obvious that to even pose them as I just did is obscene. The answer is YES, and it’s a yes that now needs to be shouted in the streets.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that if you take even 5 minutes to look at the data on crime and police violence, the answer appears to be “no,” in every case, albeit with one important caveat. I’m not talking about how the police behaved in 1970 or even 1990. But in the last 25 years, violent crime has come down significantly in the US, and so has the police use of deadly force. And as you’re about to see, the police used more deadly force against white people—both in absolute numbers, and in terms of their contribution to crime and violence in our society. But the public perception is, of course, completely different.</p>
<p>In a city like Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-12/lapd-use-of-force-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 was a 30-year low</a> for police shootings. Think about that…. Do the people who were protesting in Los Angeles, peacefully and violently, do the people who were ransacking and burning businesses by the hundreds—in many cases, businesses that will not return to their neighborhoods—do the people who caused so much damage to the city, that certain neighborhoods, ironically the neighborhoods that are disproportionately black, will take years, probably decades to recover, do the celebrities who supported them, and even bailed them out of jail—do any of these people know that 2019 was the 30-year low for police shootings in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Before I step out further over the abyss here, let me reiterate: Many of you are going to feel a visceral negative reaction to what I’m about to say. You’re not going to like the way it sounds. You’re especially not going to like the way it sounds coming from a white guy. This feeling of not liking, this feeling of outrage, this feeling of disgust—this feeling of “Sam, what the fuck is wrong with you, why are you even touching this topic?”—this feeling isn’t an argument. It isn’t, or shouldn’t be, the basis for your believing anything to be true or false about the world.</p>
<p>Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that I or anyone else needs to respect. Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that you should respect. In fact, it is something that you should be on your guard for. Perhaps more than any other property of your mind, this feeling can mislead you.</p>
<p>If you care about justice—and you absolutely should—you should care about facts and the ability to discuss them openly. Justice requires contact with reality. It simply isn’t the case—it cannot be the case—that the most pressing claims on our sense of justice need come from those who claim to be the most offended by conversation itself.</p>
<p>So, I’m going to speak the language of facts right now, in so far as we know them, all the while knowing that these facts run very much counter to most people’s assumptions. Many of the things you think you know about crime and violence in our society are almost certainly wrong. And that should matter to you.</p>
<p>So just take a moment and think this through with me.</p>
<p>How many people are killed each year in America by cops? If you don’t know, guess. See if you have any intuitions for these numbers. Because your intuitions are determining how you interpret horrific videos of the sort we saw coming out of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The answer for many years running is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 1000</a>. One thousand people are killed by cops in America each year. There are about 50 to 60 million encounters between civilians and cops each year, and <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 10 million arrests</a>. That’s down from a high of over 14 million arrests annually throughout the 1990’s. So, of the 10 million occasions where a person attracts the attention of the police, and the police decide to make an arrest, about 1000 of those people die as a result. (I’m sure a few people get killed even when no arrest was attempted, but that has to be a truly tiny number.) So, without knowing anything else about the situation, if the cops decide to arrest you, it would be reasonable to think that your chance of dying is around 1/10,000. Of course, in the United States, it’s higher than it is in other countries. So I’m not saying that this number is acceptable. But it is what it is for a reason, as we’re about to see.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few generic things I’d like to point here before we get further into the data. They should be uncontroversial.</p>
<p>First, it’s almost certainly the case that of these 1000 officer-caused deaths each year, some are entirely justified—it may even be true that most are entirely justified—and some are entirely unjustified, and some are much harder to judge. And that will be true next year. And the year after that.</p>
<p>Of the unjustified killings, there are vast differences between them. Many have nothing in common but for the fact that a cop killed someone unnecessarily. It might have been a terrible misunderstanding, or incompetence, or just bad luck, and in certain cases it could be a cop who decides to murder someone because he’s become enraged, or he’s just a psychopath. And it is certainly possible that racial bias accounts for some number of these unjustified killings.</p>
<p>Another point that should be uncontroversial—but may sound a little tone-deaf in the current environment, where we’ve inundated with videos of police violence in response to these protests. But this has to be acknowledged whenever we’re discussing this topic: Cops have a very hard job. In fact, in the current environment, they have an almost impossible job.</p>
<p>If you’re making 10 million arrests every year, some number of people will decide not to cooperate. There can be many reasons for this. A person could be mentally ill, or drunk, or on drugs. Of course, rather often the person is an actual criminal who doesn’t want to be arrested.</p>
<p>Among innocent people, and perhaps this getting more common these days, a person might feel that resisting arrest is the right thing to do, ethically or politically or as a matter of affirming his identity. After all, put yourself in his shoes, he did nothing wrong. Why are the cops arresting him? I don’t know if we have data on the numbers of people who resist arrest by race. But I can well imagine that if it’s common for African Americans to believe that the only reason they have been singled out for arrest is due to racism on the part of the police, that could lead to greater levels of non-compliance. Which seems very likely to lead to more unnecessary injury and death. This is certainly one reason why it is wise to have the racial composition of a police force mirror that of the community it’s policing. Unfortunately, there’s no evidence that this will reduce lethal violence from the side of the police. In fact, the evidence we have suggests that black and Hispanic cops are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. But it would surely change the perception of the community that racism is a likely explanation for police behavior, which itself might reduce conflict.</p>
<p>When a cop goes hands on a person in an attempt to control his movements or make an arrest, that person’s resistance poses a problem that most people don’t understand. If you haven’t studied this topic. If you don’t know what it physically takes to restrain and immobilize a non-compliant person who may be bigger and stronger than you are, and if you haven’t thought through the implications of having a gun on your belt while attempting to do that—a gun that can be grabbed and used against you, or against a member of the public—then your intuitions about what makes sense here, tactically and ethically, are very likely to be bad.</p>
<p>If you haven’t trained with firearms under stress. If you don’t know how suddenly situations can change. If you haven’t experienced how quickly another person can close the distance on you, and how little time you have to decide to draw your weapon. If you don’t know how hard it is to shoot a moving target, or even a stationary one, when your heart is beating out of your chest. You very likely have totally unreasonable ideas about what we can expect from cops in situations like these. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwWado4SVY&amp;bpctr=1592453276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbOLb0O7Pw&amp;bpctr=1592455027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_87GBOCVYTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]</p>
<p>And there is another fact that looms over all this like the angel of Death, literally: Most cops do not get the training they need. They don’t get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQLOmfx8X_E&amp;feature=emb_title">hand-to-hand training</a> they need—they don’t have good skills to subdue people without harming them. All you need to do is watch YouTube videos of botched arrests to see this. The martial arts community stands in perpetual astonishment at <a href="https://youtu.be/F4VeHOkt_o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kinds of things cops do and fail to do</a> once they start fighting with suspects. Cops also don’t get the firearms training they need. Of course, there are elite units in many police departments, but most cops do not have the training they need to do the job they’re being asked to do.</p>
<p>It is also true, no doubt, that some cops are racist bullies. And there are corrupt police departments that cover for these guys, and cover up police misconduct generally, whether it was borne of racism or not.</p>
<p>But the truth is that even if we got rid of all bad cops, which we absolutely should do, and there were only good people left, and we got all these good people the best possible training, and we gave them the best culture in which to think about their role in society, and we gave them the best methods for de-escalating potentially violent situations—which we absolutely must do—and we scrubbed all the dumb laws from our books, so that when cops were required to enforce the law, they were only risking their lives and the lives of civilians for reasons that we deem necessary and just—so the war on drugs is obviously over—even under these conditions of perfect progress, we are still guaranteed to have some number of cases each year where a cop kills a civilian in a way that is totally unjustified, and therefore tragic. Every year, there will be some number of families who will be able to say that the cops killed their son or daughter, or father or mother, or brother or sister. And videos of these killings will occasionally surface, and they will be horrific. This seems guaranteed to happen.</p>
<p>So, while we need to make all these improvements, we still need to understand that there are very likely always to going to be videos of cops doing something inexplicable, or inexplicably stupid, that results in an innocent person’s death, or a not-so-innocent person’s death. And sometimes the cop will be white and the victim will be black. We have 10 million arrests each year. And we now live in a panopticon where practically everything is videotaped.</p>
<p>I’m about to get further into the details of what we know about police violence, but I want to just put it to you now: If we’re going to let the health of race relations in this country, or the relationship between the community and the police, depend on whether we ever see a terrible video of police misconduct again, the project of healing these wounds in our society is doomed.</p>
<p>About a week into these protests I heard Van Jones on CNN say, “If we see one more video of a cop brutalizing a black man, this country could go over the edge.” He said this, not as indication of how dangerously inflamed people have become. He seemed to be saying it as an ultimatum to the police. With 10 million arrests a year, arrests that have to take place in the most highly armed society in the developed world, I hope you understand how unreasonable that ultimatum is.</p>
<p>We have to put these videos into context. And we have to acknowledge how different they are from one another. Some of them are easy to interpret. But some are quite obviously being interpreted incorrectly by most people—especially by activists. And there are a range of cases—some have video associated with them and some don’t—that are now part of a litany of anti-racist outrage, and the names of the dead are intoned as though they were all evidence of the same injustice. And yet, they are not.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XKQqgVlk0NQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Scott</a> was stopped for a broken taillight and got out of his car and tried to flee. There might have been a brief struggle over the officer’s taser, that part of the video isn’t clear. But what is clear is that he was shot in the back multiple times as he was running away. That was insane. There was zero reason for the officer to feel that his life was under threat at the point he opened fire. And for that unjustified shooting, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. I’m not sure that’s long enough. That seemed like straight-up murder.</p>
<p>The George Floyd video, while even more disturbing to watch, is harder to interpret. I don’t know anything about Derek Chauvin, the cop who knelt on his neck. It’s quite possible that he’s a terrible person who should have never been a cop. He seems to have a significant number of complaints against him—though, as far as I know, the details of those complaints haven’t been released. And he might be a racist on top of being a bad cop. Or he might be a guy who was totally in over his head and thought you could restrain someone indefinitely by keeping a knee on their neck indefinitely. I don’t know. I’m sure more facts will come out. But whoever he is, I find it very unlikely that he was intending to kill George Floyd. Think about it. He was surrounded by irate witnesses and being filmed. Unless he was aspiring to become the most notorious murderer in human history, it seems very unlikely that he was intending to commit murder in that moment. It’s possible, of course. But it doesn’t seem the likeliest explanation for his behavior.</p>
<p>What I believe we saw on that video was the result of a tragic level of negligence and poor training on the part of those cops. Or terrible recruitment—it’s possible that none of these guys should have ever been cops. I think for one of them, it was only his fourth day on the job. Just imagine that. Just imagine all things you don’t know as a new cop.  It could also be a function of bad luck in terms of Floyd’s underlying health. It’s been reported that he was complaining of being unable to breath before Chauvin pinned him with his knee. The knee on his neck might not have been the only thing that caused his death. It could have also been the weight of the other officer pinning him down.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly what happened in the cast of Eric Garner. Half the people on earth believe they witnessed a cop choke Eric Garner to death in that video. That does not appear to be what happened. When Eric Garner is saying “I can’t breathe” he’s not being choked. He’s being held down on the pavement by several officers. Being forced down on your stomach under the weight of several people can kill a person, especially someone with lung or heart disease. In the case of Eric Garner, it is absolutely clear that the cop who briefly attempted to choke him was no longer choking him. If you doubt that, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/Nql1xRtWKOU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> again.</p>
<p>And if you are recoiling now from my interpretation of these videos, you really should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_c-E_i8Q5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the killing of Tony Timpa</a>. It’s also terribly disturbing, but it removes the variable of race and it removes any implication of intent to harm on the part of the cops about as clearly as you could ask. It really is worth watching as a corrective to our natural interpretation of these other videos.</p>
<p>Tony Timpa was a white man in Dallas, who was suffering some mental health emergency and cocaine intoxication. And he actually called 911 himself. What we see is the bodycam footage from the police, which shows that he was already in handcuffs when they arrived—a security guard had cuffed him. And then the cops take over, and they restrain Timpa on the ground, by rolling him onto a stomach and putting their weight on him, very much like in the case of Eric Garner. And they keep their weight on him—one cop has a knee on his upper back, which is definitely much less aggressive than a knee on the neck—but they crush the life out of him all the same, over the course of 13 minutes. He’s not being choked. The cops are not being rough. There’s no animus between them and Timpa. It was not a hostile arrest. They clearly believe that they’re responding to a mental health emergency. But they keep him down on his belly, under their weight, and they’re cracking jokes as he loses consciousness. Now, your knowledge that he’s going to be dead by the end of this video, make their jokes seem pretty callous. But this was about as benign an imposition of force by cops as you’re going to see. The crucial insight you will have watching this video, is that the officers not only had no intent to kill Tony Timpa, they don’t take his pleading seriously because they have no doubt that what they’re doing is perfectly safe—perfectly within protocol. They’ve probably done this hundreds of times before.</p>
<p>If you watch that video—and, again, fair warning, it is disturbing—but imagine how disturbing it would have been to our society if Tony Timpa had been black. If the only thing you changed about the video was the color of Timpa’s skin, then that video would have detonated like a nuclear bomb in our society, exactly as the George Floyd video did. In fact, in one way it is worse, or would have been perceived to be worse. I mean, just imagine white cops telling jokes as they crushed the life out of a black Tony Timpa… Given the nature of our conversation about violence, given the way we perceive videos of this kind, there is no way that people would have seen that as anything other than a lynching. And yet, it would not have been a lynching.</p>
<p>Now, I obviously have no idea what was in the minds of cops in Minneapolis. And perhaps we’ll learn at trial. Perhaps a tape of Chauvin using the N-word in another context will surface, bringing in a credible allegation of racism. It seems to me that Chauvin is going to have a very hard time making sense of his actions. But most people who saw that video believe they have seen, with their own eyes, beyond any possibility of doubt, a racist cop intentionally murder an innocent man. That’s not what the video necessarily shows.</p>
<p>As I said, these videos can be hard to interpret, even while seeming very easy to interpret. And these cases, whether we have associated video or not, are very different. Michael Brown is reported to have punched a cop in the face and attempted to get his gun. As far as I know, there’s no video of that encounter. But, if true, that is an entirely different situation. If you’re attacking a cop, trying to get his gun, that is a life and death struggle that almost by definition for the cop, and it most cases justifies the use of lethal force. And honestly, it seems that no one within a thousand miles of Black Lives Matter is willing to make these distinctions. An attitude of anti-racist moral outrage is not the best lens through which to interpret evidence of police misconduct.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many videos of people getting arrested. And I’ve seen the outraged public reaction to what appears to be inappropriate use of force by the cops. One overwhelming fact that comes through is that people, whatever the color of their skin, don’t understand how to behave around cops so as to keep themselves safe. People have to stop resisting arrest. This may seem obvious, but judging from most of these videos, and from the public reaction to them, this must be a totally arcane piece of information. When a cop wants to take you into custody, you don’t get to decide whether or not you should be arrested. When a cop wants to take you into custody, for whatever reason, it’s not a negotiation. And if you turn it into a wrestling match, you’re very likely to get injured or killed.</p>
<p>This is a point I once belabored in a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/racism-and-violence-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast with Glenn Loury</a>, and it became essentially a public service announcement. And I’ve gone back and listened to those comments, and I want to repeat them here. This is something that everyone really needs to understand. And it’s something that Black Lives Matter should be teaching explicitly: If you put your hands on a cop—if you start wrestling with a cop, or grabbing him because he’s arresting your friend, or pushing him, or striking him, or using your hands in way that can possibly be interpreted as your reaching for a gun—you are likely to get shot in the United States, whatever the color of your skin.</p>
<p>As I said, when you’re with a cop, there is always a gun out in the open. And any physical struggle has to be perceived by him as a fight for the gun. A cop doesn’t know what you’re going to do if you overpower him, so he has to assume the worst. Most cops are not confident in their ability to physically control a person without shooting him—for good reason, because they’re not well trained to do that, and they’re continually confronting people who are bigger, or younger, or more athletic, or more aggressive than they are. Cops are not superheroes. They’re ordinary people with insufficient training, and once things turn physical they cannot afford to give a person who is now assaulting a police officer the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>This is something that most people seem totally confused about. If they see a video of somebody trying to punch a cop in the face and the person’s unarmed, many people think the cop should just punch back, and any use of deadly force would be totally disproportionate. But that’s not how violence works. It’s not the cop’s job to be the best bare-knuckled boxer on Earth so he doesn’t have to use his gun. A cop can’t risk getting repeatedly hit in the face and knocked out, because there’s always a gun in play. This is the cop’s perception of the world, and it’s a justifiable one, given the dynamics of human violence.</p>
<p>You might think cops shouldn’t carry guns. Why can’t we just be like England? That’s a point that can be debated. But it requires considerable thought in a country where there are over 300 million guns on the street. The United States is not England.</p>
<p>Again, really focus on what is happening when a cop is attempting to arrest a person. It’s not up to you to decide whether or not you should be arrested. Does it matter that you know you didn’t do anything wrong? No. And how could that fact be effectively communicated in the moment by your not following police commands? I’m going to ask that again: How could the fact that you’re innocent, that you’re not a threat to cop, that you’re not about to suddenly attack him or produce a weapon of your own, how could those things be effectively communicated at the moment he’s attempting to arrest you by your resisting arrest?</p>
<p>Unless you called the cops yourself, you never know what situation you’re in. If I’m walking down the street, I don’t know if the cop who is approaching me didn’t get a call that some guy who looks like Ben Stiller just committed an armed robbery. I know I didn’t do anything, but I don’t know what’s in the cop’s head. The time to find out what’s going on—the time to complain about racist cops, the time to yell at them and tell them they’re all going to get fired for their stupidity and misconduct—is after cooperating, at the police station, in the presence of a lawyer, preferably. But to not comply in the heat of the moment, when a guy with the gun is issuing commands—this raises your risk astronomically, and it’s something that most people, it seems, just do not intuitively understand, even when they’re not in the heat of the moment themselves, but just watching video of other people getting arrested.</p>
<p>Ok. End of public-service announcement.</p>
<p>The main problem with using individual cases, where black men and women have been killed by cops, to conclude that there is an epidemic of racist police violence in our society, is that you can find nearly identical cases of white suspects being killed by cops, and there are actually more of them.</p>
<p>In 2016, John McWhorter wrote a <a href="https://time.com/4404987/police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> in Time Magazine about this.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of what he wrote:</p>
<p>“The heart of the indignation over these murders is a conviction that racist bias plays a decisive part in these encounters. That has seemed plausible to me, and I have recently challenged those who disagree to present a list of white people killed within the past few years under circumstances similar to those that so enrage us in cases such as what happened to Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Walter Scott, Sam Debose, and others.”</p>
<p>So, McWhorter issued that challenge, as he said, and he was presented with the cases [<a href="https://youtu.be/EPxNUKw0kV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/VBUUx0jUKxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6KhRcIOuurI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]. But there’s no song about these people, admonishing us to say their names. And the list of white names is longer, and I don’t know any of them, other than Tony Timpa. I know the black names. In addition to the ones I just read from McWhorter’s article, I know the names of Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, and Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile, and now, of course, I know the name of George Floyd. And I’m aware of many of the details of these cases where black men and women have been killed by cops. I know the name of Breonna Taylor. I can’t name a single white person killed by cops in circumstances like these—other than Timpa—and I just read McWhorter’s article where he lists many of them.</p>
<p>So, this is also a distortion in the media. The media is not showing us videos of white people being killed by cops; activists are not demanding that they do this. I’m sure white supremacists talk about this stuff a lot, who knows? But in terms of the story we’re telling ourselves in the mainstream, we are not actually talking about the data on lethal police violence.</p>
<p>So back to the data: Again, cops kill around 1000 people every year in the United States. About 25 percent are black. About 50 percent are white. The data on police homicide are all over the place. The federal government does not have a single repository for data of this kind. But they have been pretty carefully tracked by outside sources, like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, for the last 5 years. These ratios appear stable over time. Again, many of these killings are justifiable, we’re talking about career criminals who are often armed and, in many cases, trying to kill the cops. Those aren’t the cases we’re worried about. We’re worried about the unjustifiable homicides.</p>
<p>Now, some people will think that these numbers still represent an outrageous injustice. Afterall, African Americans are only 13 percent of the population. So, at most, they should be 13 percent of the victims of police violence, not 25 percent. Any departure from the baseline population must be due to racism.</p>
<p>Ok. Well, that sounds plausible, but consider a few more facts:</p>
<p>Blacks are 13 percent of the population, but they commit <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 50 percent</a> of the murders and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883">other violent crimes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have 13 percent of the population responsible for 50 percent of the murders—and in some cities committing 2/3rds of all violent crime—what percent of police attention should it attract? I don’t know. But I’m pretty sure it’s not just 13 percent. Given that the overwhelming majority of their victims are black, I’m pretty sure that most black people wouldn’t set the dial at 13 percent either.</p>
<p>And here we arrive at the core of the problem. The story of crime in America is overwhelmingly the story of black-on-black crime. It is also, in part, a story of black-on-white crime. For more than a generation, crime in America really hasn’t been a story of much white-on-black crime. [Some listeners mistook my meaning here. I’m not denying that most violent crime is intraracial. So, it’s true that most white homicide victims are killed by white offenders. Per capita, however, the white crime rate is much lower than the black crime rate. And there is more black-on-white crime than white-on-black crime.—SH]</p>
<p>The murder rate has come down steadily since the early 1990’s, with only minor upticks. But, nationwide, blacks are still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 times more likely</a> to get murdered than whites, and in some cities their risk is double that. And <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/wiener/programs/pcj/files/PoliceandPublicDiscourseBlackonBlackViolence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 95 percent</a> of the murders are committed by members of the African American community. [While reported in 2015, these data were more than a decade old. Looking at more recent data from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI’s Uniform Crime Report</a>, the number appears to be closer to 90 percent.—SH]</p>
<p>The weekend these protests and riots were kicking off nationwide—when our entire country seemed to be tearing itself apart over a perceived epidemic of racist police violence against the black community, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-sees-18-homicides-deadliest-day-60-years/story?id=71150234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">92 people were shot, and 27 killed</a>, in Chicago alone—one city. This is almost entirely a story of black men killing members of their own community. And this is far more representative of the kind of violence that the black community needs to worry about. And, ironically, it’s clear that one remedy for this violence is, or would be, effective policing.</p>
<p>These are simply the facts of crime in our society as we best understand them. And the police have to figure out how to respond to these facts, professionally and ethically. The question is, are they doing that? And, obviously, there’s considerable doubt that they’re doing that, professionally and ethically.</p>
<p>Roland Fryer, the Harvard economist who’s work I discussed on the podcast with Glenn Loury, studied police encounters involving black and white suspects and the use of force.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> is titled, this from 2016, “An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force.”</p>
<p>Fryer is black, and he went into this research with the expectation that the data would confirm that there’s an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at black men. But he didn’t find that. However, he did find support for the suspicion that black people suffer more nonlethal violence at the hands of cops than whites do.</p>
<p>So let’s look at this.</p>
<p>The study examined data from 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida and California. Generally, Fryer found that there is 25 percent greater likelihood that the police would go hands on black suspects than white ones—cuffing them, or forcing them to ground, or using other non-lethal force.</p>
<p>Specifically, in New York City, in encounters where white and black citizens were matched for other characteristics, they found that:</p>
<p>Cops were…</p>
<ul>
<li>17 percent more likely to go hands on black suspects</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them into a wall</li>
<li>16 percent more likely to put them in handcuffs (in a situation in which they aren’t arrested)</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them to the ground</li>
<li>25 percent more likely to use pepper spray or a baton</li>
<li>19 percent more likely to draw their guns</li>
<li>24 percent more likely to point a gun at them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more or less the full continuum of violence short of using lethal force. And it seems, from the data we have, that blacks receive more of it than whites. What accounts for this disparity? Racism? Maybe. However, as I said, it’s inconvenient to note that other data suggest that black cops and Hispanic cops are more likely to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. I’m not sure how an ambient level of racism explains that.</p>
<p>Are there other explanations? Well, again, could it be that blacks are less cooperative with the police. If so, that’s worth understanding. A culture of resisting arrest would be a very bad thing to cultivate, given that the only response to such resistance is for the police to increase their use of force.</p>
<p>Whatever is true here is something we should want to understand. And it’s all too easy to see how an increased number of encounters with cops, due to their policing in the highest crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black, and an increased number of traffic stops in those neighborhoods, and an increased propensity for cops to go hands-on these suspects, with or without an arrest, for whatever reason—it’s easy to see how all of this could be the basis for a perception of racism, whether or not racism is the underlying motivation.</p>
<p>It is totally humiliating to be arrested or manhandled by a cop. And, given the level of crime in the black community, a disproportionate number of innocent black men seem guaranteed to have this experience. It’s totally understandable that this would make them bitter and mistrustful of the police. This is another vicious circle that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>But Fryer also found that black suspects are around 25 percent less likely to be shot than white suspects are. And in the most egregious situations, where officers were not first attacked, but nevertheless fired their weapons at a suspect, they were more likely to do this when the suspect was white.</p>
<p>Again, the data are incomplete. This doesn’t not cover every city in the country. And a larger study tomorrow might paint a different picture. But, as far as I know, the best data we have suggest that for, whatever reason, whites are more likely to be killed by cops once an arrest is attempted. And a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more recent study</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  by David Johnson and colleagues found similar results. And it is simply undeniable that more whites are killed by cops each year, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to their contributions to crime and violence in our society.</p>
<p>Can you hear how these facts should be grinding in that well-oiled machine of woke outrage? Our society is in serious trouble now. We are being crushed under the weight of a global pandemic and our response to it has been totally inept. On top of that, we’re being squeezed by the growing pressure of what might become a full-on economic depression. And the streets are now filled with people who imagine, on the basis of seeing some horrific videos, that there is an epidemic of racist cops murdering African Americans. Look at what this belief is doing to our politics. And these videos will keep coming. And the truth is they could probably be matched 2 for 1 with videos of white people being killed by cops. What percentage of people protesting understand that the disparity runs this way? In light of the belief that the disparity must run the other way, people are now quite happy to risk getting beaten and arrested by cops themselves, and to even loot and burn businesses. And most people and institutions are supporting this civil unrest from the sidelines, because they too imagine that cops are killing black people in extraordinary numbers. And all of this is calling forth an authoritarian response from Trump—and leading to more examples of police violence caught on video.</p>
<p>As I hope I’ve made clear, we need police reform—there’s no question about this. And some of the recent footage of the police attacking peaceful protests is outrageous. Nothing I just said should signify that I’m unaware of that. From what I’ve seen—and by the time I release this podcast, the character of all this might have changed—but, from what I’ve seen, the police were dangerously passive in the face of looting and real crime, at least in the beginning. In many cities, they just stood and watched society unravel. And then they were far too aggressive in the face of genuinely peaceful protests. This is a terrible combination. It is the worst combination. There’s no better way to increase cynicism and anger and fear, on all sides.</p>
<p>But racializing how we speak about the problem of police violence, where race isn’t actually the relevant variable—again, think of Tony Timpa— this has highly negative effects. First, it keeps us from talking about the real problems with police tactics. For instance, we had the recent case of Breonna Taylor who was killed in a so-called “no knock” raid of her home. As occasionally happens, in this carnival of moral error we call “the war on drugs,” the police had the wrong address, and they kicked in the wrong door. And they wound up killing a totally innocent woman. But this had nothing to do with race. The problem is not, as some commentators have alleged, that it’s not safe to be “sleeping while black.” The problem is that these no-knock raids are an obscenely dangerous way of enforcing despicably stupid laws. White people die under precisely these same circumstances, and very likely in greater numbers (I don’t have data specifically on no-knock raids, but we can assume that the ratio is probably conserved here).</p>
<p>Think about how crazy this policy is in a nation where gun ownership is so widespread. If someone kicks in your door in the middle of the night, and you’re a gun owner, of course you’re going to reach for your gun. That’s why you have a gun in the first place. The fact that people bearing down on you and your family out of the darkness might have yelled “police” (or might have not yelled “police”; it’s alleged in some of these cases that they don’t yell anything)—the fact that someone yells “police” isn’t necessarily convincing. Anyone can yell “police.” And, again, think of the psychology of this: If the police have the wrong house, and you know there is no reason on earth that real cops would take an interest in you, especially in the middle of the night, because you haven’t done anything (you’re not the guy running a meth lab)—and now you’re reaching for your gun in the dark—of course, someone is likely to get killed. This is not a racial issue. It’s a terrible policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process of police reform isn’t straightforward—and it is made massively more complicated by what’s happening now. Yes, we will be urging police reform in a very big way now, that much seems clear. But Roland Fryer <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also shown</a> that investigations of the cops, in a climate where viral videos and racial politics are operating, have dramatic effects, many of which are negative.</p>
<p>He studied the aftermath of the investigations into police misconduct that followed the killings Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, and Lequan McDonald, and found that, for reasons that seem pretty easy to intuit, proactive police contact with civilians decreases drastically, sometimes by as much 100 percent, once these investigations get started. This is now called “The Ferguson Effect.” The police still answer 911 calls, but they don’t investigate suspicious activity in the same way. They don’t want to wind up on YouTube. And when they alter their behavior like this, homicides go up. Fryer estimates that the effects of these few investigations translated into 1000 extra homicides, and almost 40,000 more felonies, over the next 24 months in the US. And, of course, most of the victims of those crimes were black. One shudders to imagine the size of the Ferguson effect we’re about to see nationwide… I’m sure the morale among cops has never been lower. I think it’s almost guaranteed that cops by the thousands will be leaving the force. And it will be much more difficult to recruit good people.</p>
<p>Who is going to want to be a cop now? Who could be idealist about occupying that role in society? It seems to me that the population of people who will become cops now will be more or less indistinguishable from the population of people who become prison guards. I’m pretty sure there’s a difference there, and I think we’re likely to see that difference expressed in the future. It’s a grim picture, unless we do something very creative here.</p>
<p>So there’s a real question about how we can reform police departments, and get rid of bad cops, without negatively impacting the performance of good cops? That’s a riddle we have to solve—or at least we have to understand what the trade-offs are here.</p>
<p>Why is all of this happening now? Police killings of civilians have gone way down. And they are rare events. They are 1/10,000 level events, if measured by arrests. 1/50-60,000 level events if measured by police encounters. And the number of unarmed people who are killed is smaller still. Around 50 last year, again, more were white than black. And not all unarmed victims are innocent. Some get killed in the act of attacking the cops.  [<a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/05/19/breaking-officer-involved-shooting-in-buckingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/officer-involved-shooting-in-adair-county-oklahoma/527-e8cdc435-dcd0-429c-962f-b2c82c22068e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article36802032.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>]</p>
<p>Again, the data don’t tell a clean story, or the whole story. I see no reason to doubt that blacks get more attention from the cops—though, honestly, given the distribution of crime in our society, I don’t know what the alternative to that would be. And once the cops get involved, blacks are more likely to get roughed up, which is bad. But, again, it simply isn’t clear that racism is the cause. And contrary to everyone’s expectations, whites seem more likely to get killed by cops. Actually, one factor seems to be that whites are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 times more likely</a> to commit “suicide by cop” (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 times more likely</a> to commit suicide generally). What’s going on there? Who knows?</p>
<p>There’s a lot we don’t understand about these data. But ask yourself, would our society seem less racist if the disparity ran the other way? Is less physical contact, but a greater likelihood of getting shot and killed a form of white privilege? Is a higher level of suicide by cop, and suicide generally, a form of white privilege? We have a problem here that, read either way, you can tell a starkly racist narrative.</p>
<p>We need ethical, professional policing, of course. But the places with the highest crime in our society need the most of it. Is there any doubt about that? In a city like Milwaukee, blacks are 12 times more likely to get murdered than whites [Not sure where I came by this number, probably a lecture or podcast. It appears the rate is closer to <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/01/12/gun-homicides-milwaukee-has-two-thirds-of-states-gun-killings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 times more likely</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/07/13/residential-segregation-associated-with-black-white-disparity-in-firearm-homicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 times more likely</a> in Wisconsin as a whole—SH], again, they are being killed by other African Americans, nearly 100 percent of the time. I think the lowest figure I’ve seen is 93 percent of the time. [As noted above, more recent data suggest that it’s closer to 90 percent]. What should the police do about this? And what are they likely to do now that our entire country has been convulsed over one horrific case of police misconduct?</p>
<p>We need to lower the temperature on this conversation, and many other conversations, and understand what is actually happening in our society.</p>
<p>But instead of doing this, we now have a whole generation of social activists who seem eager to play a game of chicken with the forces of chaos. Everything I said about the problem of inequality and the need for reform stands. But I think that what we are witnessing in our streets, and on social media, and even in the mainstream press, is a version of mass hysteria. And the next horrific video of a black person being killed by cops won’t be evidence to the contrary. And there will be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a>. There are 10 million arrests every year. There will always be another video.</p>
<p>And the media has turned these videos into a form of political pornography. And this has deranged us. We’re now unable to speak or even think about facts. The media has been poisoned by bad incentives, in this regard, and social media doubly so.</p>
<p>In the mainstream of this protest movement, it’s very common to hear that the only problem with what is happening in our streets, apart from what the cops are doing, is that some criminal behavior at the margins—a little bit of looting, a little bit of violence—has distracted us from an otherwise necessary and inspiring response to an epidemic of racism. Most people in the media have taken exactly this line. People like Anderson Cooper on CNN or the editorial page of the New York Times or public figures like President Obama or Vice President Biden. The most prominent liberal voices believe that the protests themselves make perfect moral and political sense, and that movements like Black Lives Matter are guaranteed to be on the right side of history. How could anyone who is concerned about inequality and injustice in our society see things any other way? How could anyone who isn’t himself racist not support Black Lives Matter?</p>
<p>But, of course, there’s a difference between slogans and reality. There’s a difference between the branding of a movement and its actual aims. And this can be genuinely confusing. That’s why propaganda works. For instance, many people assume there’s nothing wrong with ANTIFA, because this group of total maniacs has branded itself as “anti-fascist.” What could be wrong with being anti-fascist? Are you pro fascism?</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem with Black Lives Matter—though, happily, unlike ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter actually seems committed to peaceful protest, which is hugely important. So the problem I’m discussing is more ideological, and it’s much bigger than Black Lives Matter—though BLM is its most visible symbol of this movement. The wider issue is that we are in the midst of a public hysteria and moral panic. And it has been made possible by a near total unwillingness, particularly on the Left, among people who value their careers and their livelihoods and their reputations, and fear being hounded into oblivion online—this is nearly everyone left-of-center politically. People are simply refusing to speak honestly about the problem of race and racism in America.</p>
<p>We are making ourselves sick. We are damaging our society. And by protesting the wrong thing, even the slightly wrong thing, and unleashing an explosion of cynical criminality in the process—looting that doesn’t even have the pretense of protest—the Left is empowering Trump, whatever the polls currently show. And if we are worried about Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, as I think we really should be, this is important to understand. He recently had what looked like paramilitary troops guarding the White House. I don’t know if we found out who those guys actually were, but that was genuinely alarming. But how are Democrats calls to “abolish the police” going to play to half the country that just watched so many cities get looted? We have to vote Trump out of office and restore the integrity of our institutions. And we have to make the political case for major reforms to deal with the problem of inequality—a problem which affects the black community most of all.</p>
<p>We need police reform; we need criminal justice reform; we need tax reform; we need health care reform; we need environmental reform—we need all of these things and more. And to be just, these policies will need to reduce the inequality in our society. If we did this, African Americans would benefit, perhaps more than any other group. But it’s not at all clear that progress along these dimensions primarily entails us finding and eradicating more racism in our society.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, what would real progress on the problem of racism look like? What would utter progress look like?</p>
<p>Here’s what I think it would look like: More and more people (and ultimately all people) would care less and less (and ultimately not at all) about race. As I’ve said before in various places, skin color would become like hair color in its political and moral significance—which is to say that it would have none.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you don’t agree with that aspiration. Maybe you think that tribalism based on skin color can’t be outgrown or shouldn’t be outgrown. Well, if you think that, I’m afraid I don’t know what to say to you. It’s not that there’s nothing to say, it’s just there is so much we disagree about, morally and politically, that I don’t know where to begin. So that debate, if it can even be had, will have to be left for another time.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this conversation, I have to assume that you agree with me about the goal here, which is to say that you share the hope that there will come a time where the color of a person’s skin really doesn’t matter. What would that be like?</p>
<p>Well, how many blondes got into Harvard this year? Does anyone know? What percentage of the police in San Diego are brunette? Do we have enough red heads in senior management in our Fortune 500 companies? No one is asking these questions, and there is a reason for that. No one cares. And we are right not to care.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which people cared about hair color to the degree that we currently care—or seem to care, or imagine that others care, or allege that they secretly care—about skin color. Imagine a world in which discrimination by hair color was a thing, and it took centuries to overcome, and it remains a persistent source of private pain and public grievance throughout society, even where it no longer exists. What an insane misuse of human energy that would be. What an absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p>The analogy isn’t perfect, for a variety of reasons, but it’s good enough for us to understand what life would be like if the spell of racism and anti-racism were truly broken. The future we want is not one in which we have all become passionate anti-racists. It’s not a future in which we are forever on our guard against the slightest insult—the bad joke, the awkward compliment, the tweet that didn’t age well. We want to get to a world in which skin color and other superficial characteristics of a person become morally and politically irrelevant. And if you don’t agree with that, what did you think Martin Luther King Jr was talking about?</p>
<p>And, finally, if you’re on the Left and don’t agree with this vision of a post-racial future, please observe that the people who agree with you, the people who believe that there is no overcoming race, and that racial identity is indissoluble, and that skin color really matters and will always matter—these people are white supremacists and neo-Nazis and other total assholes. And these are also people I can’t figure out how to talk to, much less persuade.</p>
<p>So the question for the rest of us—those of us who want to build a world populated by human beings, merely—the question is, how do we get there? How does racial difference become uninteresting? Can it become uninteresting by more and more people taking a greater interest in it? Can it become uninteresting by becoming a permanent political identity? Can it become uninteresting by our having thousands of institutions whose funding (and, therefore, very survival) depends on it remaining interesting until the end of the world?</p>
<p>Can it become less significant by being granted more and more significance? By becoming a fetish, a sacred object, ringed on all sides by taboos? Can race become less significant if you can lose your reputation and even your livelihood, at any moment, by saying one wrong word about it?</p>
<p>I think these questions answer themselves. To outgrow our obsession with racial difference, we have outgrow our obsession with race. And you don’t do that by maintaining your obsession with it.</p>
<p>Now, you might agree with me about the goal and about how a post-racial society would seem, but you might disagree about the path to get there—the question of what to do next. In fact, one podcast listener wrote to me recently to say that while he accepted my notion of a post-racial future, he thinks it’s just far too soon to talk about putting racial politics behind us. He asked me to imagine just how absurd it would have been to tell Martin Luther King Jr, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, that the path beyond racism requires that he become less and less obsessed with race.</p>
<p>That seems like a fair point, but Coleman Hughes has drawn my attention to a string of MLK quotes that seem to be just as transcendent of racial identity politics as I’m hoping to be here. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1087593991976243200?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see these quotations</a> on his Twitter feed. None of those statements by King would make sense coming out of Black Lives Matter at the moment.</p>
<p>In any case, as I said, I think we are living in a very different time than Martin Luther King was. And what I see all around me is evidence of the fact that we were paying an intolerable price for confusion about racism, and social justice generally—and the importance of identity, generally—and this is happening in an environment where the path to success and power for historically disadvantaged groups isn’t generally barred by white racists who won’t vote for them, or hire them, or celebrate their achievements, or buy their products, and it isn’t generally barred by laws and policies and norms that are unfair. There is surely still some of that. But there must be less of it now than there ever was.</p>
<p>The real burden on the black community is the continued legacy of inequality—with respect to wealth, and education, and health, and social order—levels of crime, in particular, and resulting levels of incarceration, and single-parent families—and it seems very unlikely that these disparities, whatever their origin in the past, can be solved by focusing on problem of lingering racism, especially where it doesn’t exist. And the current problem of police violence seems a perfect case in point.</p>
<p>And yet now we’re inundated with messages from every well-intentioned company and organization singing from the same book of hymns. Black Lives Matter is everywhere. Of course, black lives matter. But the messaging of this movement about the reality of police violence is wrong, and it’s creating a public hysteria.</p>
<p>I just got a message from the American Association for the Advancement of Science talking about fear of the other. The quote from the email: “Left unchecked, racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of the other can enter any organization or community – and destroy the foundations upon which we must build our future.” Ok, fine. But is that really the concern in the scientific community right now, “unchecked racism, sexism, and homophobia.” Is that really what ails science in the year 2020? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you the fear of the other that does seem warranted, everywhere, right now. It’s the other who has rendered him or herself incapable of dialogue. It’s the other who will not listen to reason, who has no interest in facts, who can’t join a conversation that converges on the truth, because he knows in advance what the truth must be. We should fear the other who thinks that dogmatism and cognitive bias aren’t something to be corrected for, because they’re the very foundations of his epistemology.  We should fear the other who can’t distinguish activism from journalism or politics from science. Or worse, can make these distinctions, but refuses to. And we’re all capable of becoming this person. If only for minutes or hours at a time. And this is a bug in our operating system, not a feature. We have to continually correct for it.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking things that many of us learned when the Covid-19 pandemic was first landing on our shores, and we were weighing the pros and cons of closing the schools, was that for tens of millions of American kids, going to school represents the only guarantee of a decent meal on any given day. I’m pretty confident that most of the kids we’re talking about here aren’t white. And whatever you think about the opportunities in this country and whatever individual success stories you can call to mind, there is no question that some of us start on third base, or second base. Everyone has a lot to deal with, of course. Life is hard. But not everyone is a single mom, or single grandparent, struggling to raise kids in the inner city, all the while trying to keep them from getting murdered. The disparities in our society are absolutely heartbreaking and unacceptable. And we need to have a rational discussion about their actual causes and solutions.</p>
<p>We have to pull back from the brink here. And all we have with which to do that is conversation. And the only thing that makes conversation possible is an openness to evidence and arguments—a willingness to update one’s view of the world when better reasons are given. And that is an ongoing process, not a place we ever finally arrive.</p>
<p>Ok… Well, perhaps that was more of an exhortation than I intended, but it certainly felt like I needed to say it. I hope it was useful. And the conversations will continue on this podcast.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>

    <title>A few thoughts on the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://samharris.org/thoughts-implosion-pangburn-philosophy/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, the Day of Reflection conference, scheduled for November 17 in NYC, has been cancelled, and some hundreds of ticket holders are now left seeking refunds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was forced to pull out of this event &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/1043277230632132608"&gt;nearly two months ago&lt;/a&gt; and have said very little about it since. Now that Travis Pangburn has officially announced that he will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PangburnInspire/status/1062431248205864962"&gt;“folding” his touring company&lt;/a&gt;, Pangburn Philosophy, I can give a brief account of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I participated in 10 events organized by Pangburn Philosophy between September 2017 and July 2018. I didn’t always approve of the way those events were staged or marketed, but all of them appeared to be successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, after the cancellation of an August 2018 conference in Auckland, Pangburn seemed intent on running his business off a cliff. He owed a lot of money to several speakers at that point, in the form of unpaid fees and reimbursements. Most egregiously, he seemed less than fully committed to refunding ticket holders for the cancelled Auckland conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, I had two more dates on the calendar with Pangburn in 2018: a dialogue with Brian Greene in Toronto (September 5) and the Day of Reflection conference in New York (November 17). I kept my appointment in Toronto because I was contractually obligated to do so. I also didn’t want to do anything that would harm Pangburn’s ability to pay his mounting debts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After Toronto, however, it became clear that Pangburn could not be trusted to put his house in order. Facing a total lack of transparency, and realizing that Pangburn was using my ongoing association with him to book future speakers, I withdrew from the NYC conference on September 21 (as well as from a Vancouver conference scheduled for March 2019). Legally, I was able to do this because Pangburn was in breach of my speaking contract. Ethically, I had a far more compelling reason to back out: I couldn’t promote or participate in an event for which I believed other speakers were unlikely to get paid; nor could I continue to work with someone who still hadn’t given refunds to ticket holders for a conference that had been canceled more than a month before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I withdrew from the NYC conference, my management team asked Pangburn to give us the email addresses of all ticket holders so that we could notify them that I was no longer involved with the event. Pangburn refused to provide this information. However, he assured us that he would notify everyone himself. (I do not know whether he ever did.) He then stopped responding to our emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the time I pulled out of the NYC conference, I assumed that the revenue from ticket sales was still safely in the box office and that Pangburn would be obliged to issue refunds should the conference fail. That’s how things normally work, especially at a reputable venue like Lincoln Center. It hadn’t occurred to me that New York ticketholders might suffer the same fate as those in Auckland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was left with a legal and ethical puzzle that I could not solve. Again, I had no way to communicate with ticket holders directly, and discussing the chaos surrounding Pangburn on my podcast never seemed like an option. Several friends and colleagues still had events on the calendar with him, and I didn’t want to do anything to derail them. In addition, many speakers who were aware of my reasons for pulling out of the NYC conference were still signed on and seemed intent on making it work. I couldn’t see anything to do that wouldn’t risk creating further harms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Pangburn still owes several speakers (including me) an extraordinary amount of money, we were willing to participate in the NYC conference for free as recently as a few days ago, if he would have handed it over to us and stepped away. I have been told that this offer was made, and he declined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it appalling that so many people were needlessly harmed by the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy. I can assure you that every speaker associated with the NYC event will be much wiser when working with promoters in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &amp;#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&amp;#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&amp;#8217;ve been writing about my &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/"&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/"&gt;the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, and after four years and &lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/"&gt;dozens and dozens of applications&lt;/a&gt;, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&amp;#8211;where I studied&amp;#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles"&gt;Damoclean sword&lt;/a&gt; for essentially my entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why Higher Ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/"&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve written before&lt;/a&gt;, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&amp;#8217;s office has ever actually &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*For reasons that I&amp;#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&amp;#8217;t native French-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoD is back in business!</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIU Zero-time Adjunct Follow-up</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/24/siu-zero-time-adjunct-follow/" type="text/html"/>
    <content type="xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday’s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing’s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn’t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don’t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he’s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn’t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we’ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won’t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people–artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry–also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday’s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don’t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other “intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units”? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, “professor” is still a word with a meaning. Most people–I dare say the vast majority of people–think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don’t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don’t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don’t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That’s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct “professors” recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students–they’d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts’ soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can’t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it’s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees–I stopped counting–earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

    <title>And so It Has Come to This</title>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don’t speak adminstratese, “zero-time” means “unpaid.” Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn’t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as “service to the discipline” and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this “extra” work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs’ ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don’t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it’s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By now I hope you all know about the ongoing global scandal of clinical trial results being left unpublished, and of course our AllTrials campaign. Doctors, researchers, and patients cannot make truly informed choices about which treatments work best if they don’t have access to all the trial results. Earlier this year, I helped out […]</div>
