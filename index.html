            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Minnesota has a state flag, and it is <em>hideous</em>. They stuck the state seal on a blue background and called it done, so it&#8217;s this horribly busy smear with a farmer and a fleeing Indian and flowery glop and a bunch of dates on it. It&#8217;s tasteless and ugly.</p>

<p>Ick. Not that the flag is particularly important, but could we at least have one that isn&#8217;t embarrassing?</p>
<p>A few people are <a href="https://newmnflag.org/designs">lobbying for a new flag</a>, an effort that doesn&#8217;t have a high priority right now, but they&#8217;ve definitely got some better designs. I like this one.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/northstarflag.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/northstarflag-500x301.png" alt="" width="500" height="301" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65805" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/northstarflag-500x301.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/northstarflag-150x90.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/northstarflag-300x180.png 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/northstarflag-768x462.png 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/northstarflag.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple and distinctive. I&#8217;d vote for it. Heck, I wouldn&#8217;t be ashamed to fly it in front of my house, if I bothered with flags at all.</p>

<p class="lead">I have no idea how the war is going in Ukraine &#8212; it seems to be turning into a hard slog of urban warfare, with Putin committed to saving face by throwing everything he&#8217;s got at a couple of cities. He has turned his vicious elite Chechen units on the country. I&#8217;m going to take solace in the little victories, at least.</p>
<p>That bearded guy to the right is Magomed Tushaev, a monster who committed atrocities against LGBT people. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ruthless-warlord-who-led-gay-26354341">He&#8217;s dead now</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>A despotic general who ruthlessly rounded up and killed LGBT+ people in an act that became known as the “gay purge” has been killed in the fighting in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Magomed Tushayev, who was a military boss under the command of hardman Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, was killed in fighting at the Hostomel Airport, a key Russian target not far northwest of Kyiv.</p>
<p>Tushayev previously led the 141 motorised regiment of the Checnyan National Guard and his death was confirmed by a spokesperson for Ukrainian president Vlodomyr Zelensky.</p>
<p>Anti-LGBT+ purges were first reported in the southern Russian republic back in 2017 and reportedly involved kidnappings, torture and extrajudicial killings.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the infamous Kadyrov, who recently said Vlaidimir Putin needed harsher tactics in Ukraine, Tushayev was key in the persecution of LGBT+ people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Am I a bad person if I say, &#8220;Good!&#8221;?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a worrying sign for the Russians that generals are getting killed. Usually it&#8217;s just the grunts on the front.</p>

<p>I am a bit dismayed. I&#8217;ve never heard of any of his opponents, they&#8217;re all &#8220;debating&#8221; exactly the same topic &#8212; which tells me that Hovind set it &#8212; and also, they&#8217;re all hosted on the same &#8220;impartial&#8221; YouTube channel, Standing for Truth Ministries. You&#8217;ve been suckered, gang. You&#8217;re getting gamed. These are all a sham. Why do people keep falling for this nonsense?</p>
<p>I can guess why. Hovind is stupid, shallow, and repetitive; you listen to him talk and you think, &#8220;that&#8217;s all wrong, I know enough to counter that argument,&#8221; and you confidently challenge him to a debate. But then you let him set the agenda, since he&#8217;ll refuse to talk to you if he doesn&#8217;t, and he decides the venue, because, again, he&#8217;ll refuse if you don&#8217;t let him. Then when you do engage him, he just says the same dumbass crap every time. <q>Evolution is the dumbest religion in the world.</q> <q>Do you believe you came from an amoeba?</q> <q>Cats have never given birth to dogs.</q> Yadda yadda yadda.</p>
<p>You might precisely and eloquently deliver the facts that demonstrate he&#8217;s wrong on every point. You think you&#8217;ll get him this time, because you listen to a few of his &#8220;debates&#8221; and discover that they never change, he always says exactly the same stupid things, so you will be prepared. It doesn&#8217;t matter, because Hovind will consider it a victory if he obtusely refuses to accept anything you say. He&#8217;s got the mind of a two-year-old who has learned the word &#8220;NO&#8221;. He&#8217;ll sail through your debate, rejecting all evidence and reason, and emerge at the end not having learned anything, and then he&#8217;ll sign up another sucker who will let him execute the same performance.</p>
<p>Stop doing this. Show a little spine. If you really want to debate him (I can&#8217;t understand why, it&#8217;s not going to look good on your CV), then demand a debate on a much narrower topic, and get a moderator who is not a fawning lickspittle creationist like SFT, one who will actually shut you down if you veer off topic. This is the way. It is the only way.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll at least get the satisfaction of seeing Kent Hovind yip-yip-yip as a runs away from your conditions.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pat Robertson came out of retirement to claim that Putin &quot;is being compelled by God&quot; to invade Ukraine in preparation for a massive End Times invasion of Israel. <a href="https://t.co/Pmwybf57Ay">pic.twitter.com/Pmwybf57Ay</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Right Wing Watch (@RightWingWatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RightWingWatch/status/1498410764113256455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>He is explaining to us that Putin is an agent of God who is making a righteous move to expand towards Israel to bring about the End Times. He&#8217;s going to take over Ukraine as part of a march towards the Dardenelles so that, when the Apocalypse arrives, he can kill all the Jews, except for the ones who convert to Christianity. A little geography reminder:</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/gogmagog.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/gogmagog-500x748.png" alt="" width="500" height="748" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65794" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/gogmagog-500x748.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/gogmagog-100x150.png 100w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/gogmagog-201x300.png 201w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/03/gogmagog.png 745w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Taking Ukraine doesn&#8217;t get him that close to Robertson&#8217;s hallucinated destination. He&#8217;s also going to have to take Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey. I wonder how much Robertson&#8217;s prayers for victory every step of the way will help?</p>
<p>Robertson is barely able to move anymore, so we shouldn&#8217;t worry about him. There are others like him in the halls of Congress, though, who believe in that bizarre Christian eschatology of the End Times and the Rapture and who babble about &#8220;Judeo-Christian morality&#8221; while dreaming of the day all the Jews are eradicated or converted in a world-wide spasm of destruction…and who believe that would be a good thing. When you&#8217;re fantasizing about Hell on Earth and mass slaughter, I guess someone like Putin begins to look like a divine hero.</p>

A quick click on Twitter confirmed my worst fears. &ldquo;Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes&rdquo;, tweeted the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba. &ldquo;This is a war of aggression and Ukraine must defend itself and will win," Ukraine's foreign minister added. &ldquo;The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.&rdquo;</p> <p>Why didn't I leave sooner? As an Irish citizen, I'm privileged in having that option. I moved to Lviv, two and a half years ago, while trying to finish a novel. An affordable, picturesque city that sits on the crossroads between Europe and the Russian-speaking world, it seemed like the perfect destination.</p> <p>In that time, the city has become my home. Once an important regional outpost of the Habsburg empire, Lviv has always been culturally closer to Vienna than Moscow. But since the 2014 Maidan Revolution, it has become visibly pro-European, as Ukraine attempts to move away from its Soviet past. The use of the Ukrainian language in the public cultural and civic life of the city has been a particularly important of that process.</p> <p>I don't claim to be an expert on these matters. To my shame, I have little knowledge of the Ukrainian language. Yet I've also made good friends here. With Lviv locals, with people in Kyiv, and with Europeans and Americans in Lviv with similar literary and cultural interests. When the drums of war started beating, I didn't know if I should stay or go. In mid February the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, in Dublin, told all Irish citizens it was no longer safe to stay in the country.</p> <p>I ignored the advice. Leaving in a panic seemed drastic. Also, the close bonds I had built in Lviv had become important to me. Especially as a war seemed increasingly likely. Our friendships had strengthened during the last few months. Finally, however, I booked a flight leaving Ukraine on Sunday. On Wednesday evening, however, I was checking Twitter every minute or so. My bags were packed, but I wondered if the weekend would be too late.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>Just after 8am on Thursday, with three bags and my passport packed, I decided it was best to get out sooner rather than later.</p> <p>As I opened the door of my flat I saw my neighbour across the hallway. &ldquo;You are leaving,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Well, I hope everything will be okay.&rdquo; I said an awkward goodbye and then boarded the number 1 tram on the outskirts of Lviv. Heading down Lychakivska Street there was long lines of people outside ATMs, frantically withdrawing cash.</p> <p>Passing by Lviv Town hall in Rynok Square I heard the sound of emergency aerial bomb sirens. I messaged a good friend in Kyiv on WhatsApp.</p> <p>&ldquo;Stay safe,&rdquo; I wrote.</p> <p>&ldquo;Stay alive,&rdquo; she replied.</p> <p>At Lviv-Holovnyi railway station at 9am crowds congregated calmly in the main hall looking for a ticket promising a way out of war. The mood was stoic, and quietly respectful. My train to Przemyśl, Poland, 114 kilometers from Lviv, was due to leave at 11am.</p> <p>Two hours later the train station in Lviv was eerily empty, with no sign of moving transport. More Ukrainian military arrived outside the station in trucks, smoking cigarettes, unpacking their equipment. The emergency bomb sirens rang out in the distance. I messaged my friends who were fleeing to the Polish border by car. &ldquo;We are a bit stuck,&rdquo; one of them explained. &ldquo;We might have to abandon the car and walk.&rdquo;</p> <p>The train finally left Lviv just before 4pm.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>By 6pm, I was in Poland, where the press eagerly awaited the first contingent of war-fleeing migrants. I set up camp in Przemyśl train station, near the border, surrounded by others who had fled the country, and settled down for the night. We lay on deck chairs and texted our loved ones. A small, cute, ruddy cheeked infant laughed in front of me and made me smile. Her grandmother silently wept across the room.</p> <p>Polish military handed out soup, coffee, bread, water, and chocolate to all arrivals. The cross-European tolerance, decency, and solidarity was reassuring; proof, if any more was needed, of why Ukraine wants to turn west. The hospitality continued the next day, on the train south to the capital, Krak&oacute;w. More free water, fruit, sandwiches and smiles from the Poles.</p> <p>But on Friday afternoon the news coming from Kyiv was not good. Ukrainian officials urged residents to take shelter from advancing Russian forces, as Vladimir Putin encouraged them to take the capital by force. Another friend told me she was going to spend the night with her boyfriend at one of Kyiv's metro stations, hiding from rocket fire. Like tens of thousands of fellow Ukrainians, she was heading west towards Lviv, and then to the Polish border. But the exit strategy was getting harder and harder.</p> <p>An acquaintance in Lviv told me the city was becoming unsafe. &ldquo;There are rumours of a full scale Russian bombing on the city, he said. &ldquo;And people are regularly going to bomb shelters.&rdquo;</p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <p>At 6am Saturday morning another friend texted from Kyiv. Her 60-year-old uncle was preparing to go fight with a rifle on the capital's front line to defend Ukraine, she said. &ldquo;Night was very hard,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;There was many explosions just a few km from me for hours. Not going now to railway as there are shootings and street fights not far from me and railway, I'm also still hearing explosions from time to time.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;The Russians just bombed the airport close to my place&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;And got to a civil building too.&rdquo;</p> <p>Miraculously, she managed to board a train a few hours later.</p> <p>On Saturday afternoon in Krak&oacute;w, I met some fo my Lviv friends for lunch. It had taken them 24 hours to cross from Lviv into Poland. They were sleep deprived and trying to maintain their sanity. Finding ourselves suddenly in Poland with a war raging in the east, we all began to ask the question: <em>where to next? </em></p> <p>Some talked of staying in Krak&oacute;w. Others mention going to Prague, maybe Berlin, or even Copenhagen. In these uncertain times, however, most plans weren't going beyond the next few hours.</p> <p>I texted my friend in Kyiv again to see if the train had safely reached Lviv. It had. &ldquo;You must be glad you finally made the decision to flee,&rdquo; I wrote. &ldquo;No," came the response. "I am scared for my family and what happens to them and that I will never see them alive again,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;There are no words to describe all the bombings and the horror of the situation.&rdquo;</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>On Saturday at dusk, in Krak&oacute;w's beautiful Old Town, we joined a hundred or so Ukrainians on a peaceful public demonstration. Some were refugees. Others were Ukrainians, long-term residents of the Polish city. We walked behind and joined in with the continual chanting, the demand for a No Fly Zone to stop the Russian airstrikes, including the shelling of residential neighbourhoods. &ldquo;Close the sky, close the sky, close the sky.&rdquo;</p> <p>One American-Ukrainian friend from Lviv broke down in tears beside me. Her grandparents had fled to the west from Lviv after the Soviets occupied the city at the end of the Second World War.</p> <p>"History repeating itself," we said.</p> <p>That night we took a drink in a dive bar in Krak&oacute;w. I read on Twitter how the Pravda Beer Brewery in Lviv had suspended all production of alcohol. It was now making Molotov cocktails instead.</p> <p>We spent most of the night on our phones making contact with friends in Lviv and Kyiv. The news was moving fast and much of it was coming via Facebook and Whats App groups. Anyone who had left Lviv was offering their free apartments to fellow refugees fleeing from various other Ukrainian cities.</p> <p>A small network of war-time bonding was building in real time. Most of the talk returned to Putin's next possible military moves. Some said they felt sick even looking at the news. At midnight I tried to sleep in my hostel. On my Twitter feed I looked on in horror, as Kyiv and Kharkiv lit up in a ball of orange flame.</p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <p>On Sunday afternoon, I boarded a bus from Krak&oacute;w to Budapest. It was mostly Ukrainian refugees on board. I struggled to understand my relationship to them. As an Irish citizen forced to leave my home of two and a half years, am I also a refugee? I do not speak their language. I also had the privilege of being able to plan my departure.</p> <p>We all left Ukraine, suddenly, for the same reason: war. But their loss would be much greater than mine. That much I knew. Some might lose homes, family members even. The country they return to will have witnessed great horror, whatever changes it achieves.</p> <p>As we passed over the snow-capped mountains, into Stanica, Slovakia, a Ukrainian woman beside me took a phone call, speaking in English. It appeared she was speaking to a man who was paralysed by panic. &ldquo;Go to the Polish border now," she was telling him. "You need to move quick. But remember, it's women and children who go first,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo; And in any case, Ukrainian men between 18 and 60 cannot leave Ukraine because of martial law ... You must be patient and trust in God.&rdquo;<strong> </strong></p> <p>On the bus, I befriended a woman from Kyiv in her mid 20s who was sat beside me. She spent most of the journey on her phone watching live speeches from President Zelensky, on the strength of the Ukrainian resistance, and sanctions on Russia applied by the west, along with their contributions of military support.</p> <p>&ldquo;I feel I already want to return to Ukraine, and help my country out somehow,&rdquo; she told me. When the driver announced there was a ten minute break, we bought a coffee and smoked a cigarette. &ldquo;Maybe we could find a church and pray,&rdquo; she said. But there was no time. So we went back to the bus as darkness fell.</p> <p>On Sunday evening I made contact again with my friend in Kyiv who had fled for Poland on Saturday morning. &ldquo;I think I'm having a nervous breakdown,&rdquo; she wrote to me, just after she crossed the Polish border at Przemyśl . &ldquo;I got to Lviv and there was a huge clash of people trying to get the train to Poland to escape. Instead of the normal 2 hour train, we spent 24 hours on a train without a toilet and the ability to sit or stand properly, and now I'm just sitting here crying.&rdquo;</p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <p>On Monday morning, I was in central Budapest. When I bought a coffee outside my hostel on the central street of Dob Utca, most people around me were speaking Ukrainian, dragging their suitcases. I checked my Twitter feed. The UN claimed up to 368,000 have already left Ukraine since Thursday. It's estimated that up to 4 million could leave in what is shaping up to be the most devastating conflict on European soil since 1945.</p> <p>I messaged my friend in Kyiv again, discussing possible options, as she moves on from Poland. &ldquo;I know it must be hard to plan ahead after what you have been through,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;but you should try and think of what you are going to do short term, and what the easiest safest options are for you.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;I feel like it's a bad dream,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Like in a few days I'll be able to go back home to my ordinary life, to my parents, to walks, and to nice coffees,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My mind refuses to accept this new reality.&rdquo;</p> <p>In the afternoon I boarded a train to Zagreb. Snow fell, as it passed Lake Balaton in the Transdanubian region of Hungary. Movement felt like a distraction. Or a coping mechanism of sorts.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>My intended destination is Sarajevo. But I have no real plan. I'll most likely spend my days on Twitter, watching a conflict from afar that's becoming more brutal and unpredictable with each passing day. There's now a scary realisation that this is no small-scale war. Europe and the wider world, meanwhile, look on with horror. Now I have a little time to reflect on my journey, I remember that initial sense of relief on crossing the border to Poland. It didn't last for long.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2CAATC3.jpg" height="787" alt="Marcelo Bielsa" width="1181" /></p> <p class="p1">Soon after taking over in 1961, Leeds United manager Don Revie became obsessed with the idea that his football ground was haunted. The club wasn&rsquo;t reaching its potential, while the players kept on choking when it really mattered. Revie invited a medium to &ldquo;cleanse&rdquo; the space of evil spirits.</p> <p class="p3">For a while, it seemed to have worked. By the end of the 1963-64 season, Leeds had been promoted to the First Division (now the Premier League). But, in keeping with previous years, they missed out on the title by goal difference, finishing second. Revie became convinced that a curse had been placed on the club.</p> <p class="p3">One might pass Revie&rsquo;s actions off as the work of a paranoid mind. Yet they fit squarely within a longstanding tradition of football being elevated to the level of the spiritual. We might even go so far as to say that football is an opium of the people.</p> <p class="p3">A hundred years ago, the pioneering sociologist Emile Durkheim argued that religion emerged through communal living, while the earliest faiths were based not on cosmogonies, but the worship of sacred symbols, or &ldquo;totems&rdquo;, that expressed the values of a tribe itself. Tribesmen wore their coats of arms about their body, much like football fans today wear shirts, face paint and badges bearing their club&rsquo;s logos and colours. And like the single community that constitutes a church, football stadiums and other such venues offer physical locations where abstract values can be embodied through ceremony, ritual and symbolism.</p> <p class="p3">According to Durkheim, early social rituals were an &ldquo;eminently collective thing&rdquo;. The devotee confused the effervescent feeling of a social life greater than him or herself with an experience of divinity. The most obvious manifestation of this in football is the tendency among fans to see players as figures to worship &ndash; saints, if not gods. After all, Diego Maradona even has a religion founded in his name:<em> Iglesia Maradoniana</em>, or the Church of Maradona.</p> <p class="p3">But if, among devoted fans, football clubs are churches, then what does that make their managers? The recent tumultuous history of Leeds United shows us how the way in which clubs are run &ndash; making use of myth and ritual &ndash; can impact and transform the psyches of players and fans, for better or for worse.</p> <h2 class="p3">Don Revie and the cult of money</h2> <p class="p3">Don Revie, as we&rsquo;ve seen, was a deeply superstitious man. The medium was only the beginning. During the course of his leadership from 1961 to 1974, he invited a fortune teller to urinate on the four corners of the pitch, and scrapped the club&rsquo;s nickname of the &ldquo;Peacocks&rdquo; and the owl on its badge out of a fear of feathered creatures. His actions revealed the mindset of an insecure and determined manager, but there was something much deeper at work in his turn to the irrational.</p> <p class="p3">Revie knew that the fortunes of Leeds United were central to the city&rsquo;s concept of itself. As Anthony Clavane describes in his cultural history of the club, <em>Promised Land: A Northern Love Story,</em> Leeds players aligned themselves with the concerns of upwardly mobile, inwardly anxious northern men, just like Don Revie himself, who could never quite reconcile where he came from with who he wanted to be.</p> <p class="p3">His Leeds came to be reviled as nasty cheaters, intent on winning whatever the method. Don Revie&rsquo;s had become a blind faith in money and success at all costs, a creed that seemed to infect the club. By the new millennium, Leeds United was engaging in a reckless spending spree which took them to the heights of footballing Europe, matching the city&rsquo;s swagger as a regenerated financial centre and &ldquo;Knightsbridge of the North&rdquo;. But the owners and players had banked on the club attaining regular Champions League football to fund their lavish new lifestyle. They didn&rsquo;t.</p> <p class="p3">The club imploded spectacularly. They sold their best players, got relegated, went into administration, got relegated again, and spent 15 years in the wilderness, a kind of Ozymandias. The biggest one-city club in Europe lay wrecked in the desert of the third tier of English football, its cracked visage standing as a warning of the hubris of living beyond your means.</p> <p class="p3">I asked Clavane about the club&rsquo;s history and how it feeds into the idea of sport-as-religion. He described Leeds, both city and club, as perennial underachievers longing for salvation. By 2018, he told me, &ldquo;Leeds needed an outsider to come in and turn [its] world &ndash; the club&rsquo;s and city&rsquo;s &ndash; upside down.&rdquo; And that is exactly what happened: <em>call and he will answer</em>.</p> <h2 class="p3">Believing in the team</h2> <p class="p4">Walk the streets of Leeds today and you will see murals of a man who has eschewed the trappings of his wealth, who turned down residence in a luxury hotel in favour of living in a one-bedroom flat, who appeared at exclusive black-tie dinners wearing a tracksuit, and who once bought a car as a prize for the staff Christmas raffle. You may have heard him called many names: El Loco, The Professor, The Bucket Man. To Leeds United fans, Marcelo Bielsa is simply known as God.</p> <p class="p3">An Argentinian, Bielsa transformed the club and brought a new source of pride to the city. He did so, in part, by applying a new set of beliefs to Leeds United. Where the religion of the market would dictate that players should have been sold and &ldquo;better&rdquo; products bought, Bielsa kept nearly all of those from the season prior to his arrival. While past managers had put their trust in money, El Loco (&ldquo;The Crazy One&rdquo;) appeared to have faith in his players, in their capacity not just to make mistakes but to make amends, to learn, to improve.</p> <p class="p3">On the first game of the 2018-19 season, Leeds emerged <em>sui generis</em> to blow away Stoke City &ndash; favourites to be promoted to the Premier League &ndash; with a brand of free-flowing, high-pressing, life-affirming football that would become the hallmark of Bielsa&rsquo;s Leeds. In 2020, when they marched back to the Premier League, players long seen as write-offs quickly corrected their critics. Patrick Bamford became the second highest scoring Englishman behind Harry Kane, while Kalvin Phillips went from a squad player to playing every game of England&rsquo;s march to the Euro 2020 final, hailed by former England manager Fabio Capello as the &ldquo;best modern midfielder&rdquo; in the world.</p> <p class="p3">Like Don Revie before him, Bielsa made use of those same tools of myth, ritual and religion. Like Revie, he had his eccentricities: the blue line he had painted between his flat and the training ground so he could focus his mind on football rather than navigation; the insane levels of preparation, which included the 19 hours he spent analysing footage of a single youth team prospect, as well as managing the under-12s during the off season and producing an eight-page dossier on a third-choice goalkeeper.</p> <p class="p3">But the principles behind Bielsa&rsquo;s managerial style came from a very particular place. A devout Catholic, while manager of Athletic Bilbao in Spain he took a trip to the St Clare Convent in Guernica. There, he prayed with the &ldquo;Poor Clares&rdquo;, an austere and ascetic order of nuns within the Roman Catholic Church that are devoted to prayer, penance, contemplation and manual work. He was so struck by his brief time at the convent that in a subsequent game he placed a sign emblazoned with &ldquo;Poor Clares&rdquo; near the manager&rsquo;s dugout, before a stadium official had it removed.</p> <p class="p3">In fact, &ldquo;Bielsaball&rdquo;, the name fans gave the manager&rsquo;s underlying style and approach, seemed very much like a secularised version of liberation theology. This Catholic movement, founded in Latin America in the 1960s, saw the church as duty-bound to help the poor and bring about the potential of all through liberation from oppression. The dignity of every human, the importance of family, community and participation, of rights and responsibilities &ndash; these values have found modern-day expression in the spirit of team sports and in Leeds United.</p> <h2 class="p3">Goodbye to a secular saint</h2> <p class="p4">But does this impulse have to be thought of as religious? We could also view Bielsa&rsquo;s attitude as rooted in a humanistic belief in people as ends in and of themselves. It is not a coincidence that the people of Leeds share something of the values of two clubs that are similarly close to Bielsa&rsquo;s heart: Athletic Bilbao and Newell&rsquo;s Old Boys, whom he managed early on in his career. Like Leeds, their core support base hails from post-industrial towns where passion and hard work, and the will to self-improvement, are as central to life in the workplace as they are in the football stands.</p> <p class="p3">As clubs around the world move toward private equity ownership and new markets, it is the identification fans have with their clubs &ndash; essentially human passions expressed through ritual and the possibility of competition &ndash; that is most at risk. On the eve of the planned departure of the Big Six clubs from the Premier League to the Super League in April 2021 &ndash; a move which placed the profit motive at the heart of the sport &ndash; Bielsa grew reflective. &ldquo;One of the reasons football is the most popular sport in the world is because the weak can beat the powerful,&rdquo; he said. And he turned out to be right. Backlash from supposedly &ldquo;disempowered&rdquo; fans led the plans for the Super League to be shelved.</p> <p class="p3">It took an outsider, an eccentric, a man with the cult following of a secular saint, to unleash the potential of Leeds United and reveal the talent that was there all along. Bielsa is no longer manager of Leeds United. But we can still learn from El Loco and his &ldquo;mad belief&rdquo; that football&rsquo;s value lies not in rapacious capitalism or winning-at-all-costs, but in working-class communities, the bonds between human beings, and the faith placed in their inherent capacity for improvement. It may not be such a crazy idea after all.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/dna1.jpg" height="477" alt="DNA" width="674" /></p> <p>In early 2001 the first human genome sequence was published. This was the culmination of a century of phenomenal genetic discovery: the identification of chromosomes in 1882; the discovery of the structure of DNA in the 1950s; and finally the publication of the 3 billion letters that make up our genetic code.</p> <p>Profound advancements in genetics have continued into this century. A single genome can now be sequenced in just days for less than $1000. Low-cost sequencing has sped up the growth of genetic data, which has progressed our understanding of the traits that make us human and that confer susceptibility to disease. Yet despite such advances, the vast majority of our genome remains relatively unexplored.</p> <p>Much focus to date has been on the minority of our genome that encodes proteins. This has been driven in part by biological logic, but also by data availability and cost. Research into the function of the remaining 97 per cent of &ldquo;non-coding&rdquo; regions (until recently often dubbed &ldquo;junk&rdquo;) has been limited. However, there is now abundant evidence that genetic variation outside of coding regions is a critical aspect of our biology. Much of this type of DNA is thought to control which genes are turned on or off &ndash; a mechanism already known to be important in a number of diseases, including Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p> <p>In November 2021 the UK Biobank (UKBB) project released 200,000 whole human genomes from largely healthy participants: the single biggest human genome dataset to date. Scientists hope that this dataset will enhance understanding of the function and impact of the non-coding genome on human health and disease, as well as improving drug discovery and development. But it holds further value: participants in the project have given broad consent to the use of their genomes such that a swathe of future research possibilities now opens up.</p> <p>The release of the 200,000 genomes last year will be followed by a further 300,000 in 2023. It&rsquo;s a boon for scientific progress, and a relative steal: the whole project cost &pound;200 million, far cheaper than the $1 billion it cost to sequence a single genome in 2001.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of our New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Released in 1972, Pong, which crudely approximates table tennis, was among the first video games created, and the early arcade machines it featured on now stand proudly in museums across the US. <br /><br />The game didn&rsquo;t require a huge amount of brain power, though it did need some: the capacity to predict where the opponent would send the ball; the ability to move the &ldquo;paddle&rdquo; to meet the ball in advance of its arrival. But it evidently didn&rsquo;t demand too much of the human body beyond that, as scientists at Cortical Labs in Australia have now proven.<br /><br />They have taught human brain cells in a petri dish to do more or less what kids did half a century ago, only this time the cells are playing against themselves, bouncing the ball against a virtual wall. Still, they need to operate the paddle and predict the ball&rsquo;s trajectory. <br /><br />The roughly 800,000 cells in the petri dish were sent electrical pulses via microelectrodes: if the ball is arriving at their left side, the signal goes to the left-hand side of the mass, and the same for the right-hand side. The white bar accordingly moves to meet the ball. Cortical Labs&rsquo; Brett Kagan told <em>New Scientist</em> magazine that the teaching of these &ldquo;cyborg mini-brains&rdquo;, as the team calls them, took only five minutes. <br /><br />The experiment will likely add to growing belief in the power &ndash; and scientific utility &ndash; of synthetic brains. In August last year, Science journal published a report on work done by researchers in France to create a computer simulation of the way in which neurons send information between different parts of the brain, and which could be observed mimicking the process of memory formation. A team at King&rsquo;s College London meanwhile used a combination of AI and the Cambridge-1 supercomputer, the UK&rsquo;s most powerful computer, to generate synthetic brain images that enable them to observe how certain illnesses or ageing-related processes trigger changes in the brain over time &ndash; all without needing to place actual humans in an MRI tunnel. <br /><br />The prospect of cyborg brains might not sit too easily. After all, Hollywood has long been telling us that if the machines rise up, humanity will fall. But there is growing scientific support for the furthering of this kind of research, not least because it will make obsolete the invasive procedures currently required to study our brains.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist spring 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

These eight-legged micro-organisms &ndash; also called water bears &ndash; are extremophiles, meaning that while they might live in a mossy corner of your garden, they can also survive in extremely hostile climes: temperatures ranging from near absolute zero to well over 100C and pressures found in the deepest ocean.<br /><br />This makes them well suited to space, particularly given their high tolerance for cosmic radiation. Chances are that tardigrades are currently living on the moon, deposited there by an Israeli spacecraft as part of a &ldquo;lunar library&rdquo; back in 2019 (see Kit Chapman on page 18). That&rsquo;s not to say that they&rsquo;re crawling around. Instead, they will have entered a form of suspended animation, adopting a dehydrated spore-like state. But should anyone administer a drop of reviving water, they could well spring back to life.<br /><br />Tardigrades have a raft of strange biological adaptations, which we&rsquo;re only beginning to understand. They contain a unique DNA damage suppressor protein that protects their genetic material from the radicals formed when high energy ionising radiation interacts with water. They also contain an unusual amount of intrinsically disordered proteins. (Most proteins, in contrast, adopt a fixed 3D shape.) <br /><br />Recently, Martin Blackledge and his team at the Institute of Structural Biology in France may have discovered a reason why they produce quite so much disordered protein. When one of these proteins was cooled or dehydrated, it formed a fibrous gel. Intriguingly, this gel protected other, more structured proteins, allowing them to stay folded and functional in the absence of the aqueous conditions normally needed to maintain their shape.<br /><br />For now, these observations have only been made with proteins isolated from the tardigrades, so how (or if) the protective mechanisms work within living organisms is still a puzzle. But it does provide yet another example of the water bears&rsquo; bizarre biochemistry. It also leads to the tantalising idea that the mechanisms used by tardigrades to protect themselves from harsh conditions could be utilised to prolong the shelf-life of protein-based therapeutics.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist spring 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook&#8217;s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>
