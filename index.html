            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">We shouldn&#8217;t forget <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/japan-shinzo-abes-government-has-a-thing-about-hitler-it-likes-him">who Shinzo Abe, good friend of Donald Trump, is</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two of Abe’s Cabinet appointees were associated with Japan’s Nazi Party and several of his comrades wrote laudatory blurbs for a book called Hitler’s Election Strategy, published in 1994, and written by a member of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The book was banned after international criticism.</p>
<p>Comparisons with the Nazis are hard to brush off if your Cabinet members are looking up to them as role models.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that Abe appointed an unrepentant racist, Eriko Yamatani, associated with the internationally condemned Zaitokukai, to oversee the National Police Agency. Neither the prime minister nor any of his senior Cabinet members openly opposed the discrimination against Japan’s Korean residents. Last month, the Cabinet announced in an approved written response to an opposition party’s question on the usage of Hitler’s Mein Kampf as teaching material in classrooms that it was completely acceptable.</p>
<p>After a public outcry, they made the obligatory comment that “if it were used as a tool to promote racism… that would be inappropriate.”</p>
<p>Initially, criticism erupted all over the country but the mainstream media practiced self-censorship and didn’t touch the issue until the outcry forced their hand as well.</p>
<p>Cabinet ministers this year also announced support for reintroducing the kamikaze-inspiring Imperial Rescript on Education back into the classroom. It was issued originally by the Meiji Era emperor in 1890 and advised citizens that the greatest moral good was to give their life for him or his successors. It was later used as part of the ideology that had Japan send soldiers out to die in airplanes as kamikaze pilots, die in small submarines as human torpedoes, and force Okinawans to commit mass suicide. After the war, the edict was declared null and void by Japan’s parliament in 1948, with a statement that it “clearly undermines basic human rights and calls into question Japan’s international fidelity.” Now, it’s on its way back. Indeed, it has been a good year for those nostalgic for prewar Japanese militarism. Bayonet practice will be making a comeback in education as well.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/07/abeassassination.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/07/abeassassination-146x150.png" alt="" width="146" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-67137" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/07/abeassassination-146x150.png 146w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/07/abeassassination-291x300.png 291w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/07/abeassassination-500x515.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/07/abeassassination.png 539w" sizes="(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px" /></a></p>
<p>Absolutely none of that justifies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/07/07/japan-shinzo-abe-shot-nara-attack/">murdering Abe</a>, especially since he was out of power. Assassination ought to always be off the table.</p>
<p>Shootings in general are extraordinarily rare in Japan, thanks to their strict gun laws. The assassin here had to construct his own handmade weapon to carry out the evil deed.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><img title="Believing oneself to be Napoleon Bonaparte is a classic &quot;delusion of grandeur&quot;" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/napoleon.jpg" height="900" alt="Napoleon Crossing the Saint-Bernard Pass by Jacques-Louis David." width="1200" /></em></p> <p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Victoria Sheperd is a radio documentary and podcast producer and a writer. We talk to her about her latest book, "A History of Delusions; the Glass King, a Substitute Husband and a Walking Corpse": a social history exploring an intriguing psychological phenomenon, told through the lives of ten people from the past who have lived inside an alternative reality. </em></p> <p><strong>How did you come to write a book about delusions?</strong></p> <p>While working on a completely different project, I found a brief reference in a book about early modern Europe to Charles VI of France, a monarch who believed that he had <em>turned into glass</em>. Here was a king publicly embroiled in the Hundred Years War with England (a busy day job), but privately terrified that he would shatter if he sat down. It&rsquo;s an absurd scenario. But I listened more carefully to it and began to hear something more serious. To the "glass king&rdquo;, the situation is no less than life and death. The courts of Europe are laughing at him. A communiqu&eacute;, it&rsquo;s meaning encrypted, is smuggled inside the [delusional] belief, demanding an audience, attention and interpretation. I made a documentary about what become known as the more widespread psychological phenomenon called &lsquo;Glass Delusion&rsquo;, and then I was hooked as a historical detective of delusions.</p> <p><strong>You focus on the lives of ten people spanning over </strong><strong>six hundred years and ending in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. How are these cases relevant to us today?</strong></p> <p>I tell the stories of several individuals from the past who were <em>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</em> in their lifetimes, their outlandish stories sensationalised further by their fame. The delusions in my book are extreme &ndash; &ldquo;Technicolour&rdquo; with the volume turned up &ndash; but they are not as far removed from our own psychological strategies as we might imagine &hellip;As a historian, I&rsquo;ve gone on the trail and tried to catch traces of the real lives and struggles behind the case studies. To create an alternative reality for oneself, to go against the common-sense reality as generally agreed by everyone else, risks ridicule and social exclusion. The question then is: What is the delusion offering by way of help or protection that is worth that ridicule?</p> <p><strong>You define a delusion as "a fixed, false idea, not shared by others, unshakeable in the face of decisive evidence contradicting it." Yet they often appear to be communal &ndash; as a reaction to new technology, or a major historical event. </strong></p> <p>Let&rsquo;s return to the "glass king". Glass was a relatively new technology at the time, specifically &lsquo;plate&rsquo; glass developed in Rouen, which could be used in domestic windows. It was new in homes and had an alchemical magic to it: here was sand, heated to extreme temperatures, which then became transparent yet hard; breakable, beautiful, fragile. It&rsquo;s not hard to see how being &lsquo;made of glass&rsquo; might operate as an instruction to the world on how to treat you. &lsquo;Stay back, or you&rsquo;ll break me&rsquo;, you declare, but also &lsquo;I&rsquo;m precious; a treasure.&rsquo; &hellip;.</p> <p>I think the many people across early modern Europe who &lsquo;turned themselves into glass&rsquo; is a poetic example of how patterns and &lsquo;epidemics&rsquo; of delusions happen. Everyone was experiencing glass as a new material, with unique, contradictory qualities, at the same time. It&rsquo;s not surprising that many pegged their own anxieties and ambivalences onto it &ndash; even felt such an affinity with the material and its qualities that they melted <em>into it</em>.</p> <p>Collective trauma is often reflected in delusions. I tell the story of a clockmaker in post-revolutionary Paris who presented at an asylum saying that, despite surviving, he had in fact had his head chopped off by the guillotine, and &ndash; the most pressing complaint of all &ndash; that there had been a mix up in the basket and he had been given the wrong head in the confusion. The proof was that he had had perfect teeth, but this lot were all rotten, as he said.</p> <p>An individual&rsquo;s delusion usually represents a challenge to the generally accepted reality. Group delusions seem to contradict this.</p> <p>However, what I have observed looking back over hundreds of years of delusions is that people may have the same delusion at the same time, but they are not usually a collective experience. Quite the contrary. An experiment by the psychologist Milton Rokeach in a Michigan hospital in the early 1960s introduced three men to each other who all believed they were Christ. Being aware of each other&rsquo;s existence did not snap them out of their delusions, as Rokeach imagined it might. There was a violent fist fight instead.</p> <p><strong>Do we have a contemporary equivalent of the "Glass Delusion"? </strong></p> <p>Since the discovery of espionage bugging devices during the Cold War made front page news, people have presented to doctors claiming that there is, for example, a chip in their tooth, downloading their thoughts. I&rsquo;m sure that Artificial Intelligence will soon feature in delusions, alongside nano-technology.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think paranoic delusions, and delusions of grandeur, are the most common forms?</strong></p> <p>Delusions of grandeur are perhaps the clearest demonstration of how delusions function as a psychological strategy. They are useful in navigating a wretched existence or a humiliating reversal of fortune, or loss of autonomy in your life. It&rsquo;s not hard to see what putting on the costume of Napoleon, for example, might offer if you&rsquo;ve lost all sense of power and control. Dozens of men turned up at French asylums after the real Napoleon had died claiming that they were themselves Napoleon. Napoleon was the poster boy of self-made power: a boy from rural Corsica who had broken into the establishment to rule half the world. Delusions are not conscious decisions, but I&rsquo;ve come to see then as ingenious imaginative creations, sometimes beautifully simple.</p> <p>A paranoid conspiracy organises the enemy in a chaotic world and gives us a job to do; it offers a clear story, a plot to be foiled, villains and heroes, and puts the person with the delusion clearly on the side of good. We humans struggle to live with ambiguity and ambivalence. There is a clear correlation between a sense of belonging and paranoia. The lower the sense of belonging in a community, the higher the incidence of paranoia.</p> <p><strong>Why is it important to understand these stories in their historical context?</strong></p> <p>The picture is always incomplete and mysterious, and we have to live with the ambiguity. But</p> <p>understanding the historical context of a delusion gives glimpses of flesh-and-blood people dealing with difficult realities behind the case study pseudonyms. The themes are perennial &ndash; love, death, war &ndash; and specifics are gold dust. For example, I write about the case of &lsquo;L&eacute;a-Anna B.&rsquo;: a milliner in 1920s Paris and the poster girl for the delusion of &lsquo;Erotomania&rsquo; &ndash; the belief that a person of high status is in love with you (when they&rsquo;re not). She believed that King George V was madly in love with her, and travelled to London to stand outside Buckingham Palace and wait for a sign from the king as to when they should meet. &lsquo;L&eacute;a-Anna B.&rsquo; had, we learn, been dumped by her lover and ostracised in her rural community. It&rsquo;s a sad, personal journey. But it&rsquo;s also significant that her delusion appeared at the birth of Hollywood when the Silver Screen was projecting larger-than-life images of true love into towns and villages across the world for the first time.</p> <p><strong>Have women and men been susceptible to different kinds of delusions? </strong></p> <p>For centuries women were far less likely to consult a physician, so we can&rsquo;t know how many experienced, for example, glass delusion.</p> <p>We do know that women are well represented in accounts of delusions seemingly triggered by a relationship ending in humiliating or disreputable circumstances, and the financial and social ruin that followed. Margaret Nicholson, for example, doorstepped King George III at St. James&rsquo;s Palace with her claim that she was descended from Boudicca and the throne of England was rightly hers. Nicholson had worked hard in service for decades, supporting herself. No one had ever had a bad word to say about her, until one night someone in her household spied a valet leaving her room. They were both fired on the spot. The valet married someone else and quickly found a new place to live. We next find Nicholson outside St. James&rsquo;s Palace, with a blunt butter knife, making her grandiose claims.</p> <p>It wasn&rsquo;t only women who could fall out of good society in a moment, but a woman&rsquo;s route back was certainly more difficult, if not impossible. Nicholson spent the rest of her life in Bedlam.</p> <p><strong>What about today? </strong></p> <p>Almost (though not quite all) historical cases of &lsquo;Erotomania&rsquo; are women. The delusion is defined by a person believing someone of high status is in love with them (when they&rsquo;re not), so it&rsquo;s not surprising that the people experiencing the delusion are typically women in service or other low-pay jobs, and the &lsquo;lovers&rsquo; typically government officers and priests.</p> <p>Today, &lsquo;Erotomania&rsquo; still typically involves a woman who believes that a man of high status is in love with her. It&rsquo;s also true that practically speaking, today, &lsquo;Erotomania&rsquo; could also be described as &lsquo;stalking&rsquo; &ndash; the &lsquo;difference&rsquo; being a technicality, that the person presenting the delusion takes no responsibility for their behaviour &ndash; it&rsquo;s the other person who is in love. A man with this delusion might be more likely to be processed by the police as a criminal, rather than being logged by a clinician as delusional.</p> <p><strong>Do you think we are more, or less prone, in our own century, to delusional thinking?</strong></p> <p>The principal types of delusion have remained consistent for as long as there have been records, so it&rsquo;s fair to assume there have been delusions for as long as there have been people. Social anxiety, political chaos, and descent into poverty are all drivers for delusion. Since there&rsquo;s also strong evidence that lack of social connection and sense of belonging makes delusional thinking more likely, the appeal of an alternative reality is surely as strong today as it&rsquo;s ever been. It&rsquo;s certainly easier than it&rsquo;s ever been for invisible operators to curate alternative realities for us in our own homes, within our social media silos.</p> <p><strong>The book seems to ask us not to dismiss delusions, but instead to see them as potentially important forms of expression.</strong></p> <p>I&rsquo;ve come to see the meaning of delusions as imaginative creations &ndash; their meanings encoded or encrypted. In writing the book, I&rsquo;ve tried to pull up a chair, figuratively speaking, and listen. We all want to be worthy of attention and interpretation. Delusions communicate that something is amiss. The question is: what is it?</p> <p>The clinicians I&rsquo;ve met along the way, both in books and in real life, all seem to have come to the same conclusion, albeit from different directions &ndash; that the best chance of coaxing someone with a delusion back [to real life] is to meet them half-way, by entering a few steps into their alternative reality. It&rsquo;s certainly not to try to argue them out of it. That&rsquo;s not how a delusion functions. It may be better to view a delusion as vital scaffolding for a disordered life, and best not to dismantle it at all. Above all, I&rsquo;ve come to feel compassion and admiration for the imaginative ingenuity of people making use of delusions in order to navigate their difficult lives.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/curtain.jpeg" height="408" alt="Iron Curtain by Vesna Goldsworthy" width="408" /></strong></span></p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Iron Curtain: A Love Story (Chatto &amp; Windus) </strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">b</span></span><span class="s1">y Vesna Goldsworthy </span></p> <p class="p6">Vesna Goldsworthy&rsquo;s beautifully crafted third novel begins with a quote from Euripides&rsquo; <em>Medea</em>: &ldquo;Stronger than lover&rsquo;s love is lover&rsquo;s hate. Incurable in each, the wounds they make.&rdquo; This is followed by a prologue marking the fall of the Berlin Wall in December 1990. Both offer clues to the novel&rsquo;s denouement.</p> <p class="p7">The main narrative opens nine years earlier in 1981 and is set east of the Iron Curtain. Milena Urbanska is the privileged daughter of a Francophone mother and a father who is vice-president of an unnamed satellite of the Soviet Union. She and her boyfriend Misha, an architecture student, are members of the elite, and as such there are several rules which don&rsquo;t apply to them. Their families have servants (although calling them that is &ldquo;studiously avoided&rdquo;) and enjoy smuggled luxuries from the west. Misha drinks bitter lemon from Italy and owns &ldquo;the only LP of <em>Evita</em> this side of the Iron Curtain.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p7">Neither are particularly happy. While a certain level of opulence is achievable, it never fully compensates for the lack of cultural and political freedoms. We are given a glimpse of Milena&rsquo;s calculating nature early on when she admits: &ldquo;I wanted a boyfriend, he was good-looking and good in bed. The local choice was limited.&rdquo; However, the comforting familiarity of their relationship is abruptly curtailed when Misha dies in a senseless game of Russian roulette, a shocking act which Goldsworthy describes in spare, stark prose.</p> <p class="p7">Numbed by the tragedy, Milena buries herself in her studies and later accepts a job translating scientific papers in maize research. She resigns herself to her lot. When a literary conference is held in the state capital, she agrees to interpret for Jason Connor, an English poet who proudly claims to be a Marxist. Inevitably he falls for the cool, &ldquo;fierce&rdquo; red princess. She in turn is attracted to Jason&rsquo;s dishevelled nonchalance. &ldquo;He walked through the arrivals gate in a yellow T-shirt and a pair of faded jeans, with a tatty little canvas back-pack on his shoulder.&rdquo; At the end of their few, mostly &ldquo;chaperoned&rdquo; days together, Jason begs Milena to leave with him. She refuses at first &ndash; but months later she defects to London, where she discovers that the grass is not always greener.</p> <p class="p7">The novel is neatly divided into two parts: east and west. It&rsquo;s a polarity that Goldsworthy knows well, having come to the UK from Belgrade in 1986, when she was 24, to live with her British husband. A poet herself, she started writing in English, her third language, and has previously described the difficulties of straddling two cultures. She has dedicated her latest novel to &ldquo;my friends who, like me, grew up east of that line from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p7">In the second half of <em>Iron Curtain</em>, she deftly illustrates western hypocrisy and the rituals of wealth that are often baffling to an outsider. Milena arrives in December 1984. Her life with Jason is not what she had expected. Funded by a grant, he&rsquo;s studying for a PhD, writing and publishing his poetry, and renting student accommodation. They eventually move to a tiny one-bed flat in Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush. Milena&rsquo;s parents employ an agent to keep an eye on her and, on receiving reports of their daughter&rsquo;s poverty, send her money.</p> <p class="p7">Goldsworthy exhibits a keen eye for detail in her droll portrayal of Jason&rsquo;s well-to-do family. They inhabit a draughty farmhouse with no central heating, and put the dogs&rsquo; needs before those of their fellow human beings. Milena drily observes: &ldquo;The wine was some of the best I&rsquo;d ever tasted, but the food was disgusting.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p7">Goldsworthy&rsquo;s evocative descriptions of both worlds &ndash; the rigid ice of the east and the damp monotony of the west &ndash; lend a filmic quality to this layered novel. Rather than suggesting that love can conquer all divides, the couple&rsquo;s story ends with a twist. The book&rsquo;s prologue suggests one outcome Milena could not have predicted.</p> <p class="p7"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

              <h2><a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5996/is-monogamy-morally-wrong#utm_source=rss">Is monogamy morally wrong?</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="A section of the " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/HYMYC5.jpg" height="946" alt="'The Arnolfini Portrait' by Jan Van Eyck" width="1600" /></p> <p class="p1">For many generations in societies shaped by Christianity, monogamy has been the almost undisputed champion of relationship norms. In Britain and the US, it has been held up as the dominant &ndash; really the only &ndash; ideal for serious romantic partnerships, toward which all of us should always be striving. According to the authors of a 2019 article in <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>, focused on the US context, a &ldquo;halo surrounds monogamous relationships . . . monogamous people are perceived to have various positive qualities based solely on the fact they are monogamous.&rdquo; Other relationship models, or even just being persistently single, have often been seen as suspect, if not morally wrong.</p> <p class="p3">Things are starting to change, though. Progressives, at least, increasingly exhibit a greater open-mindedness about intimate pairings that are not expected to be exclusive. There is growing awareness of alternatives to monogamy, such as polyamory: roughly, valuing or engaging in more than one sexual or romantic relationship at a time.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Monogamy as a social norm</span></h2> <p class="p3">The feminist critique of compulsory monogamy is compelling. According to Lori Watson, professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, &ldquo;the practice and enforcement of monogamy within marriages has largely served the interests of men.&rdquo; Throughout history, men have wanted to ensure their children are really theirs: that way, any property they bequeath ends up with their biological offspring. She concludes that &ldquo;the idea that this and only this arrangement is conducive to respectful, loving relationships is myopic &ndash; and arguably in service of shoring up the dominant position men have traditionally enjoyed.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Of course, men in contemporary societies often also face stigma for missing monogamous benchmarks. They may be accused of having &ldquo;commitment issues&rdquo; or &ldquo;failing to settle down&rdquo; if they resist, however thoughtfully or deliberately, the pervasive pressure to find a &ldquo;soulmate&rdquo; (and eschew all others). Philosopher Justin Clardy argues that heterosexual African American men who are ethically polyamorous (with the willing agreement of all concerned) are nevertheless often harmfully stereotyped as &ldquo;players&rdquo; &ndash; that is, as men who are assumed to &ldquo;just want sex&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">Even people who identify as non-binary or genderqueer are far from immune to these kinds of pressures. Like members of the gay community who led the push for same-sex marriage in the early 2000s, they know that pursuing a monogamous relationship can gain you at least partial acceptance from a society that regards you as &ldquo;other.&rdquo; Historians will remind us that not everyone in the gay community was on board with same-sex marriage. Some saw it as a regrettable capitulation to overly restrictive relationship norms; an unreasonable price to pay for relatively respectful treatment from &ldquo;straight&rdquo; society.</p> <p class="p3">Until recently, however, critics of monogamy have tended not to oppose it in principle. Rather, they have argued that we should be free to craft our relationships according to our own preferences and needs. As long as all parties are mature adults and agree to the plan, who is anyone else to judge?</p> <h2 class="p4">Power and control</h2> <p class="p5">Harry Chalmers, for one. He is part of a growing cadre of philosophers arguing that monogamy itself may be morally wrong. In his 2019 paper &ldquo;Is Monogamy Morally Permissible?&rdquo; published in the <em>Journal of Value Inquiry</em>, he argued against a laissez-faire perspective that sees both monogamy and non-monogamy appropriately sitting on the menu of options. Instead, he writes: &ldquo;We morally ought to reject monogamy.&rdquo; To be clear, Chalmers thinks people should be free to have one, and only one, sexual or romantic partner in any given period. What he thinks is wrong, rather, is the common practice of placing restrictions on how one&rsquo;s partner may act with others &ndash; in terms of sexual contact or emotional intimacy &ndash; as a condition of continuing the relationship.</p> <p class="p3">It isn&rsquo;t only Chalmers who is making this argument. Justin Clardy, the philosopher of African American polyamory I cited earlier, has also recently argued against the moral permissibility of what he calls &ldquo;intimacy confining constraints&rdquo; (even among polyamorists). These are defined as &ldquo;categorical&rdquo; restrictions on additional intimate relationships, whether sexual or &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; &ndash; as in the concept of &ldquo;emotional cheating&rdquo; &ndash; when one is in at least one such relationship already.</p> <p class="p3">Finally, in a forthcoming book chapter, Norwegian philosopher Ole Martin Moen, along with his co-author, the nurse and trans activist Aleksander S&oslash;rlie, makes a similar point.</p> <p class="p3">All of these writers appeal to an argument by analogy, focused on the case of friendships. Consider the following:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p7">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say that two friends, Jack and Jane, both love reading and often get together to discuss literature. Then Jack says to Jane that he thinks discussing literature is &lsquo;their thing&rsquo;, and that he will remain friends with her only on the condition that she does not discuss literature with anyone else &ndash; and, indeed, that this rule applies even on days when Jack is out of town, when he is busy doing other things, or when he just doesn&rsquo;t feel like hanging out or talking with Jane.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">That&rsquo;s the version of the argument from Moen and S&oslash;rlie. &ldquo;In this case,&rdquo; they remark, &ldquo;it seems clear that Jack&rsquo;s requirements are not okay; they are controlling and restricting beyond what is acceptable.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Let&rsquo;s say we agree. &ldquo;Importantly,&rdquo; Moen and S&oslash;rlie continue:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p7">&ldquo;Jack would not be able to justify this requirement by appealing to the claim that, in fact, Jane only wishes to discuss literature with him. The reason this justification does not work is that insofar as this really is the case, the requirement is redundant. The requirement is relevant, and kicks into action, only insofar as Jane might in fact want to discuss literature with someone else; the requirement serves the purpose of discouraging her from doing so. But if exclusivity requirements are not okay in the case of friendships, why are they okay in the case of romantic relationships?&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">Well, you might be thinking, because friendships (and discussing literature) and romantic relationships (and having sex) are different in various ways that justify a different standard. For example, having sex with someone risks pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, whereas discussing literature typically risks neither.</p> <p class="p5">In their respective writings, Chalmers, Clardy, Moen and S&oslash;rlie address this and other anticipated objections, arguing that, despite appearances, the claimed differences do not amount to a morally relevant distinction &ndash; at least not one that can ground a categorical restriction on extra-relational intimacy, whether physical or emotional, among romantic partners.</p> <p class="p3">For example, they point out that many forms of sexual interaction do not risk pregnancy, and that the risk of STIs, where relevant, can be reduced with safe sex practices. They also urge that the alleged &ldquo;specialness&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the special value &ndash; of a romantic relationship need not be diminished by having other such relationships: each person, and so each relationship, is unique.</p> <p class="p3">Sure, they say, we may be accustomed to thinking of sexual intimacy as fundamentally different from other forms of intimacy, like those we associate with &ldquo;Platonic&rdquo; friendship, but cultural constructs can be unlearned. Intimacies of various kinds can be important life goods, and we should want our partners, just like our friends, to be as free as possible to pursue what is good for them.</p> <p class="p3">So, they conclude, demanding monogamy of a partner &ndash; lest you withdraw your care and affection from them, or pull the plug on the whole relationship &ndash; is an illegitimate exercise of power. It&rsquo;s controlling.</p> <p class="p4">A couple of things seem to be conflated here. It&rsquo;s one thing to be in a close relationship that is <em>not</em> based on an assumption of monogamy, and then, out of nowhere, to spring a &ldquo;change of rules&rdquo; unilaterally. (&ldquo;As of today, if you are sexually intimate with anyone else besides me, I will end this relationship and cut off ties.&rdquo;) Although you have a right to leave a relationship you don&rsquo;t want to be in &ndash; for any reason &ndash; taking this route would not reflect well on your character.</p> <p class="p3">It&rsquo;s another thing, though, to make clear from the outset that, in deciding whether to invest in a serious, close relationship with someone, a shared interest in monogamy is important for you. You might say, &ldquo;Listen, if you and I don&rsquo;t share this particular value, that is totally fine. I just don&rsquo;t think that we are best suited to being long-term romantic partners.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be objectionably controlling.</p> <h2 class="p3">The importance of communication</h2> <p class="p3">Yet as Chalmers, Clardy and the others point out in their work, many people may mistakenly believe they value monogamy. Perhaps their belief is based on questionable assumptions about love: that it is a limited resource or zero-sum game, for example. Or perhaps the belief is based on morally dubious motives, such as a desire to claim or possess another person as a way of avoiding insecurity. Or, perhaps, those who think they value exclusivity simply haven&rsquo;t thought about it enough.</p> <p class="p3">There&rsquo;s no doubt that many people endorse monogamy unreflectively. Maybe most of us do. But it seems a stretch to assume this applies to everyone. So let us suppose that, in at least some cases, a well-considered, mutual agreement to be monogamous could be what is best for a couple. Based on their particular life-histories, psychologies, preferences, values and the dynamic between them, it just so happens that if each one pledges to be tied to the metaphorical mast (and to hold the other accountable while the sirens sing) this will maximise their chances of a happy relationship.</p> <p class="p3">Neither party has an independent obligation to &ldquo;get serious&rdquo; with anyone, much less specifically the other person. And each one is free to have certain desires for the kind of relationship they would like to invest in. Assuming they talk things through in advance, and no one pressures the other into making an agreement to be exclusive when that is not what the other person truly wants, it is hard to see how monogamy as such could be immoral.</p> <p class="p3">Granted, this is not how monogamous arrangements are typically pursued. Instead, there is often a presumption on the part of one partner that the other wants to be, and will be, monogamous, and when this doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be true, hearts break. Explicit communication would clearly be better. So why does it so often fail to happen?</p> <p class="p3">According to its critics, the sheer power and pervasiveness of monogamy as a social norm work against such communication. Either there is an automatic assumption of monogamy, so that raising a question about it doesn&rsquo;t even occur to you; or, there is a desire not to be monogamous, so that raising a question about it puts you at risk of being rejected by someone you&rsquo;ve come to care about, or even denigrated or socially stigmatised.</p> <p class="p5">So here is where the critics get it right. Monogamy should not be the automatic default position. That way, the need for communication would be obvious to everyone, because a preference for monogamy could not be simply assumed.</p> <p class="p3">At the same time, ethical alternatives to monogamy should be given a much bigger seat at the table. Societies should hold up examples of well-conducted non-monogamous relationships so that people can get a better sense of how they work. They won&rsquo;t be for everyone, but they will be best for some.</p> <p class="p3">In their righteous effort to knock monogamy off its pedestal, however, Chalmers and the others go too far. A mutual expectation between partners that neither will get romantically involved with others is not inherently morally wrong.</p> <p class="p3">Instead, as Bryan R. Weaver and Fiona Woollard argued in an important article published in <em>The Monist</em> in 2008, there are good and bad reasons for, and ways to pursue, monogamy. The bad ways involve making unwarranted presumptions, unreflective decisions, or being controlling, possessive or manipulative. The good ways involve clear, upfront communication, respect between parties, and equal standing to decide how things should go.</p> <p class="p3">We can and should object to the bad ways of pursuing monogamy, which may be the main ways it is currently pursued. But we shouldn&rsquo;t rule it out in principle, condemning all who would ever try to make it work. Let us all be more reflective, more open-minded and communicative. And then let us say: to each their own.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

As long ago as 1700 BC, a Babylonian god was complaining that the &ldquo;noise of mankind has become too much./I am losing sleep over their racket.&rdquo; Cities, where more than half of us now live, have only got louder. A New York subway train clocks in at 98 decibels; even the background hum of a busy office can rise to 65 decibels. We live immersed in a world of human sound.</p> <p class="p6">But not only is human noise a new thing in the world, all communicative sound is new. Life existed on the planet for three billion years before the first intimations of hearing and sound-making, and the late evolution of those faculties gives us a kinship with all other listening things.</p> <p class="p6">More than that, David George Haskell argues in his exhilarating new book <em>Sounds Wild and Broken</em>, evolution and sound-making go hand in hand. Sound, he argues, is history. The first sounds on Earth &ndash; of water, of wind, of thunder, and so on &ndash; are those we can still hear today, a kind of sonic ground beneath the infinitely varied palette of living voice and movement. When a bird sings, he writes, &ldquo;the combined experience of thousands of ancestors flows to the air&rdquo;. If you stop to listen to the music of the cricket, the oldest singing animal, you are hearing the sound of the supercontinent Pangaea, because that is where they first evolved. The larynx, common to all modern vertebrate animals, first developed in the lungfish; we hear with modified fish ears.</p> <p class="p6">On one level, this is all truism: everything we experience is a product of evolution. But, as Haskell shows, our experience of the planet&rsquo;s sonic phenomena is so circumscribed that its full majesty is an undiscovered world for us. Some of this is due to what he calls the &ldquo;perceptual box&rdquo;: evolution is a process of specialisation, and has left us simply unable to hear much of life on Earth. Technology is changing that: we can now listen to everything from whale song to insects chewing wood.</p> <p class="p6">But there is also the issue of our sheer inattentiveness &ndash; in the modern West at least &ndash; to the sound of life. Haskell writes eloquently about the paucity of our language &ndash; &ldquo;hobbled by weak verbs&rdquo; he says &ndash; when describing what we hear. He compares it unfavourably to the abundant <br />vocabulary available to conjure up motion. It follows that one of the many joys of the book is his ability to cajole language into evoking unknown sounds in the mind of the reader; some of the writing is breathtaking. It is at its strongest where it not only makes the case for listening better, but privileges the sense of hearing itself. It might be subtitled &ldquo;Towards an Aesthetic of Sound&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p6">This inattentiveness matters, Haskell says, both because of the auditory riches we are missing, and because it is leading us to destroy or degrade that plenitude. And, as he makes clear, sound and hearing have been instrumental to evolution in manifold ways, allowing species to refine their adaptiveness to specialised habitats through mating and predation, among other things. The katydid (an insect related to the cricket and grasshopper), for example, has learned to mimic the mating sounds of female cicadas, luring amorous males to their doom. In this, the katydid seems to sum up the centrality of sound to life and death on earth in one free lunch.</p> <p class="p6">Individual sounds are as fragile a phenomenon as there is. Every natural sound has loss in-built. By definition transitory, a sound emerges from silence and returns to silence: a synecdoche for life itself. Recording, Haskell writes, &ldquo;is an anchor against the tide of forgetting&rdquo;, but the tide is rising fast. All the more reason why we should pay attention, and protect the planet of sound even as sounds themselves wither and decay into oblivion. We need to ensure those silences don&rsquo;t become permanent.</p> <p class="p6">Haskell makes an eloquent, often beautiful, and powerful case for the importance of listening &ndash; and of listening before it is too late. Reading <em>Sounds Wild and Broken</em> is a deeply rewarding experience, and its message will resonate with and enrich the lives of all those who read it.</p> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Portrait of James Joyce" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/H6E0FF.jpg" height="456" alt="James Joyce" width="335" /></p> <p class="p1">Anyone buying a copy of the first edition of <em>Ulysses</em>, hot off the presses in 1922, would not have had to progress far in the book before coming across its first blasphemy.</p> <blockquote> <p class="p4">&ldquo;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressing gown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:</p> <p class="p5">&ndash; <em>Introibo ad altare Dei</em>.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p5">The Latin means &ldquo;I will go unto the altar of God&rdquo; and is, or was, said by the priest at the beginning of the former Latin Mass. Mulligan is dressed in a parody of a priest&rsquo;s vestments except that he is not only in a dressing gown; the dressing gown is undone. Is he actually naked beneath it? &ldquo;Come up, you fearful Jesuit,&rdquo; he says to Stephen Dedalus, whom attentive readers of Joyce will recognise as the hero of <em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>, plunged, in that book, into terrifying descriptions of the torments of Hell. &ldquo;Fearful&rdquo; is about right: fear was what was meant to inspire the people to faith.</p> <p class="p5">Mulligan continues with his parody: &ldquo;Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.&rdquo; He then says: &ldquo;For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ouns&rdquo; means wounds, as in God&rsquo;s wounds.) This is funny, but for a believer not funny at all: a parody of the Mass is, essentially, a Black Mass (a Satanic ritual). We are only three-quarters of the way down the first page and the Catholic reader will be having an attack of the vapours. Later on we will hear Dedalus being taunted by his own conscience for having caused his mother&rsquo;s death by refusing to pray for her. This mirrors Joyce&rsquo;s own life, as Richard Ellmann sets out in his classic 1959 biography:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p4">&ldquo;[His mother&rsquo;s] fear of death put her in mind of her son&rsquo;s impiety, and on the days following Easter she tried to persuade him to make his confession and take communion. Joyce, however, was inflexible; he feared, as he had Stephen Dedalus say later, &lsquo;the chemical action&rsquo; which would be set up in his soul &lsquo;by a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of authority and veneration&rsquo;. His mother wept, and vomited green bile into a basin, but he did not yield.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p5">It is perhaps hard to imagine the outrage with which <em>Ulysses</em> was greeted when it first became available to the general public a century ago. But this outrage was such that it became, very quickly, unavailable to readers. Before <em>Ulysses</em> had even reached book form, the editors of the American literary magazine the <em>Little Review,</em> which first serialised the text, were prosecuted for obscenity.</p> <p class="p5">Nowadays this story of one day in Dublin in June 1904 &ndash; as seen through the eyes of three people &ndash; is hailed as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century; even, perhaps, as the greatest novel ever written (this is more or less my position). How could something written with such astonishing craft be considered offensive? So Leopold Bloom is depicted in his privy, or contemplating his genitalia in the bath. Big deal: this is something we do every day. True, the number of people who masturbate to the sight of a young girl leaning backwards to look at the fireworks on Sandymount Strand is, I suspect, very close to zero (unless one is very dedicated to homage). But blasphemy? Perhaps &ldquo;sacrilege&rdquo; is the better word. In this episode on Sandymount Strand, from a nearby church comes the smell of &ldquo;fragrant incense. . . and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without the stain of original sin&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p5">There is still an awful lot of sacrilege in the book.<em> </em>It is almost hag-ridden by religion. But the parodies and mockeries are also part of the fabric of any observant society. In private, people mock what they are told to believe. I think of the Irish comedian Dave Allen&rsquo;s countless skits on the Catholic Church, or the Italian superstition that it is bad luck to run into nuns or priests in the street. These examples, and countless others, demonstrate a deep ambivalence about religion and its trappings, which can also be seen in <em>Ulysses</em> and its author. Asked, some years after the book&rsquo;s publication if he had left the Catholic Church, Joyce replied: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the Church to say.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p7">But it remains the case that <em>Ulysses</em> is the great humanist tract, the first and greatest example of the counterculture, which achieved this not only by mocking religion but also by concentrating on what it is to be human &ndash; to have not only a body but a mind through which thoughts and impressions stream unstoppably. It is humanist in the largest sense of the word, and in case we don&rsquo;t get the moral message, it is made very clear to us in the episode known to scholars as &ldquo;Cyclops&rdquo;, in which the wandering Jew, Bloom, runs into the bigoted loudmouth known as &ldquo;the citizen&rdquo; in Barney Kiernan&rsquo;s pub. To general mockery, Bloom says: &ldquo;And I belong to a race too. . . that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">&ldquo;Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?&rdquo; asks the citizen. Bloom replies: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about injustice . . . But it&rsquo;s no use &hellip; Force, hatred, history, all that. That&rsquo;s not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it&rsquo;s the very opposite of that that is really life . . . Love. I mean the opposite of hatred.&rdquo; It is very easy to imagine the scornful tone of the citizen&rsquo;s answer to this: &ldquo;A new apostle to the Gentiles. Universal love,&rdquo; he says, as if such a thing were either impossible or delusional.</p> <p class="p5">Still, I believe that is what <em>Ulysses</em> is trying to achieve, or at least hold up as an example of a better life. After this exchange comes the following passage, which has always fascinated and moved me:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p4">&ldquo;Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p5">The notes of the Oxford World&rsquo;s Classic edition of<em>Ulysses</em> (the best edition) tell us at the back that this is &ldquo;parody&rdquo;. I am not so sure. It could indeed easily be read out or imagined in a sarcastic, sing-song whine. But then it could just as easily be considered as an innocent, if naive, exhortation to the universal love that the citizen laughs at.</p> <p class="p5">Whose voice is this? There is no way in the text to tell if it is Bloom&rsquo;s internal monologue, the citizen&rsquo;s, someone in his audience&rsquo;s, or Joyce&rsquo;s. And that &ldquo;. . . but God loves everybody&rdquo;? I like to think that it is not so much the God of the priesthood that is being evoked, but a simple principle, a God &ldquo;refined out of existence&rdquo;, to use Joyce&rsquo;s own term.</p> <p class="p5">That is what <em>Ulysses</em> tells us: to love one another. Whether this has anything to do with any particular God is immaterial. And what could be more humanist than that?</p> <div class="col-9"> <div class="mceContentBody mt-3"> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
