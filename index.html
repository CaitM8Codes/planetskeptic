            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Bell.jpeg" height="864" width="863" /></p> <p class="p1">For decades, we&rsquo;ve been sold an idea that taking action on climate change is simply about making the world a better place. It&rsquo;s that old 2009 <em>USA Today </em>cartoon: a crowd at a climate conference listens to a speech on green jobs, clean water, energy independence and healthy children, and asks: &ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Climate campaigners play to this, stressing the &ldquo;co-benefits&rdquo; of climate action: reduced meat intake and travelling by foot or bicycle are good for your health, electric vehicles cut air and noise pollution, the oil industry has too much power anyway. They&rsquo;re not lying to you &ndash; there are plenty of reasons to quit fossil fuels, quite apart from global warming. But this vision of a cleaner, fairer world hides two other truths which will dominate climate politics as we move further into the middle of the 21st century.</p> <p class="p3">Firstly, there are multiple ways to tackle climate change. As more people become engaged with the climate crisis,we&rsquo;re not all going to agree on everything. A greater diversity of ideologies will shape how we confront the issue. Secondly, at this point, even the most heroic of mitigation efforts can only limit warming up to a point. We can build better defences against the coming storms, but they are coming either way. In many parts of the world, they have been more than obviously present for decades already.</p> <p class="p3">Too many still approach the climate crisis with a sense that we can solve it. But you can&rsquo;t solve a problem like the climate crisis. Recognising this is still a long way from &ldquo;doomism&rdquo; &ndash; giving in &ndash; because it&rsquo;s not game-over either. Climate change isn&rsquo;t a win-or-lose event; it happens by degree. Not just degrees of warming, but of risk, pain, courage. We need to get used to calculations in those in-between places, taking time to recognise what&rsquo;s been lost and damaged whilst remembering there is still so much we can save; so many ways we can limit suffering and protect each other. It&rsquo;s going to be hard, but how hard, for whom, and how well we help each other survive, is still very much up for grabs.</p> <h2 class="p4">The right kind of climate action</h2> <p class="p5">Calling out &ldquo;bad&rdquo; climate action, as opposed to just something you disagree with, can be slippery, especially when so much of the decision-making is a matter of weighing up relative risks and is coloured by political position. One campaigner&rsquo;s &ldquo;false solution&rdquo; is another&rsquo;s sensible choice. Still, we can and should be actively questioning whose lives climate policies are being built for, and who profits from them. The climate crisis was birthed in inequality and exploitation. We mustn&rsquo;t let our reaction to it play out in such a context too.</p> <p class="p3">As climate justice campaigners have argued for years, the poorest half of the global population contributes just ten per cent of global emissions, but overwhelmingly bears the brunt of climate change impacts. There&rsquo;s an inequality when it comes to studying those impacts too. One of the most important areas of climate research in recent years has been attribution studies: work to identify links between specific extreme weather events and climate change. Most of these studies have focused on weather events in Europe and North America, due to long-standing inequalities of data collection and global media attention. As climate scientist Sjoukje Philip told <em>Climate Home News</em> last year: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve ever done a heatwave attribution study over Africa because we never hear about it.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Meanwhile, eco-capitalism has already reached the dystopian sci-fi heights of luxury &ldquo;green&rdquo; airship tours to the North Pole being sold to look down on polar bears before their habitat melts entirely. And all the time, in the background, global climate policy continually gets stuck in debates over &ldquo;climate finance&rdquo;; policy-wonk speak for fights over how much (or rather, how little) richer countries will give the rest of the world to help tackle the climate crisis.</p> <p class="p3">In 2010, rich nations pledged $100 billion per year at the Cancun UN climate talks. The figure might seem large, but it was always way below what&rsquo;s needed, and despite all the promises, these nations have continually failed to stump up the cash. Moreover, as Jocelyn Timperly noted in a feature for <em>Nature</em> ahead of the 2021 Glasgow talks, such &ldquo;climate finance&rdquo; tends to be weighted towards profit-making projects, like solar farms or electric cars, rather than work to protect frontline communities from the impacts of climate change.</p> <p class="p3">But even if climate studies remain skewed to the rich, we have made important strides in our understanding. Perhaps most remarkably, humanity has built a whole system for collecting research on climate change and sharing it with politicians, via the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the reports they publish every three to seven years. As one of their latest reports, published in February, made clear, we should be worrying more about &ldquo;maladaptation&rdquo;. Broadly, this refers to projects designed to help people &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; to the impacts of climate change, but which have backfired in some way. Such maladaptation might have been caused by policy-makers forgetting or ignoring social and political contexts, not <br />listening to local expertise &ndash; or, in some cases, creating a false sense of security.</p> <p class="p3">In their explainer for the <em>Carbon Brief</em> website, a group from the University of Oxford give the example of a flood barrier project around the Jamuna River in Bangladesh, which ended up encouraging greater development in flood-risk areas and increasing mortality rates. They also describe agricultural modernisation in the island of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe, which was only offered to those who had land, ignoring the landless &ndash; thus causing a group already especially vulnerable to climate change to be further marginalised.</p> <p class="p3">Climate and energy writer Ketan Joshi suggests that we should talk about &ldquo;mal-mitigation&rdquo; too (though both problems need a better name): these are projects aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions, but that similarly backfire. Take the case of hyperscale data centres, which help store information in the cloud or stream video and music. These centres are often built in states like Arizona, because solar and wind resources provide cheap low-carbon electricity. The data centres&rsquo; intense thirst for water, to help cool equipment, is further drying out already parched land.</p> <p class="p3">Then there is &ldquo;greengrabbing&rdquo;. <em>Guardian</em> journalist John Vidal coined the term in 2008 to describe aggressive interests taking land, using the justification of environmental protection. Vidal refers to wealthy Americans buying up acres of Patagonia, and the case of the Bambuti Ba&rsquo;twa tribe, who lived in forests on the border of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo until the 1990s, when their lands were designated a national park in order to protect gorillas. He could easily have pointed to the history of National Parks in the United States too, where Indigenous Americans were actively removed. More recently, Morocco has been accused of greenwashing colonialism, building renewable energy developments on contested land in Western Sahara.</p> <p class="p3">Development scholars Ian Scoones and Camilla Toulmin raise similarly sceptical eyebrows over the &ldquo;Great Green Wall&rdquo;. In many respects, the Wall is an awe-inspiring project. Launched in 2007 by the African Union, it aims to grow a stretch of forest across 8,000 km and 22 countries over the widest part of the African continent &ndash; acting as a symbol of environmental action and, more practically, protecting against desertification and creating millions of green jobs, while sequestering hundreds of millions of tons of carbon.</p> <p class="p3">However, Scoones and Toulmin argue that the very idea of desertification in the area has shaky roots, based on faulty colonial science and framed by doomsday ideas of environmental degradation. Moreover, as is the case with many other large-scale forest projects, the glamour of planting new trees risks overriding the preservation of existing trees and shrubs, and could be used as an excuse to keep polluting elsewhere. As Scoones and Toulmin emphasise, if massive projects such as these are going to work, they need to listen to local needs and expertise.</p> <p class="p3">Climate campaigners can be defensive when it comes to discussing such problems. Negatives can be seized by those who want to delay climate action, blowing up critiques way beyond what is fair or necessary. But we do still need to talk about the cons as well as the pros.</p> <p class="p5">Take renewable energy. For decades, solar in particular has been pushed as a symbol of the bright new future that could be ours, if only we grasp the opportunity. It&rsquo;s brilliant, space-age science. We&rsquo;d be running directly on sunshine. But while often paraded as &ldquo;clean&rdquo;, no energy tech is without its risks and impacts.</p> <p class="p3">The earliest attempts in the 1870s were tangled in colonialism, with French solar-preneur Augustin Mouchot sent by his government to Algeria to experiment with the abundant sunlight found there. Nearly a century later, the US Army would take solar power into space, with the launch of <em>Vanguard 1</em> in 1958. Military research and development helped pave the way for domestic solar, but was ultimately rooted in Cold War displays of power.</p> <p class="p3">When solar technology finally made its way to Earth, it was initially used by the oil industry, providing power to remote oil rigs. Today, glistening solar panels are often featuredin oil industry adverts, despite the fact that these companies invest a tiny percentage of their capital expenditure in green tech. More troublingly, last summer, an investigation found forced labour from China&rsquo;s Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province being used in the production of panels. This follows years of concern from human rights groups over the supply chain for batteries &ndash; technology that renewables like solar rely upon.</p> <p class="p3">None of this is to dismiss solar, any more than raising concerns over tree-planting is a reason to dump those projects. No technology is a neutral good, and denying the problems won&rsquo;t help us solve them. The challenge is to avoid replicating the political and economic problems of fossil fuels as we decarbonise the energy system. We must use the opportunity of change to reform so much more.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">An ideological battle</span></h2> <p class="p5">People often put Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s climate campaigner moment in the late 1980s down to her scientific training, but it&rsquo;s just as likely she grasped the politics before most others. She knew that to tackle climate change seriously would require a massive economic shift, and didn&rsquo;t want to concede that space to the left. So she got in early, telling the UN in November 1989, &ldquo;We must resist the simplistic tendency to blame modern multinational industry for the damage which is being done to the environment. Far from being the villains, it is on them that we rely to do the research and find the solutions.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Fast forward to the 2020s, and many worry about a potential rise in something much further to the right: eco-fascism. This is not a new problem. As historian of eugenics Garland Allen argues, several founding fathers of the American conservation movement weren&rsquo;t just racist and environmentalist, but saw the two as intimately connected. Madison Grant is perhaps the most extreme example. His 1916 book <em>The Passing of the Great Race</em> is often described as the &ldquo;bible&rdquo; of scientific racism (Hitler certainly saw it as such, saying so when he wrote to thank Grant for writing it). Grant was also a leading conservationist, convincing friends like Rockefeller, the Vanderbilts and J. P. Morgan to help fund his dream project of the Bronx Zoo.</p> <p class="p3">For Grant and many of his friends, conservation and eugenics were part of the same project. He once said to his friend and co-conspirator, Henry Fairfield Osborn (the man who named both the Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor) that both were &ldquo;attempts to save as much as possible of the old America&rdquo;. Post-war environmentalists would distance themselves from overt fascism, including Fairfield Osborn&rsquo;s son, Jr, whose foundation <br />organised the first international climate change conference in 1963. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that this politics disappeared entirely, or that it doesn&rsquo;t continue to exist in parts of the environmentalist movement today.</p> <p class="p3">As the windows of opportunity for climate action close, we might also predict an increase in violence. Notwithstanding the recent vogue in Britain for slashing and deflating SUV tyres, thus far environmentalists have tended to stick resolutely to non-violence. Extinction Rebellion (XR) has built a movement based strongly on the rhetorical appeal of disobedience and disruption, controversially championing the idea of arrest. Still, although they&rsquo;ll happily annoy people by stopping a tube or blocking a road, they draw an important distinction between damaging property and hurting people.</p> <p class="p3">Back in early 2001, the FBI named the environmental group the Earth Liberation Front as the leading domestic terrorist threat in the US. An action in 1998 wracked up an estimated $26 million of damage &ndash; however, like XR today, they never threatened violence towards other people. Political attitudes to the word &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; would change dramatically following 9/11. Still, we now know that state concern over climate activists hardly disappeared.</p> <p class="p3">Take Mark Kennedy, the Metropolitan police officer employed to spy on environmental activists in the UK between 2003 and 2010. By the time of the 2008 Climate Camp by Kingsnorth power station in Kent, some activists had started to call him &ldquo;detective&rdquo; behind his back. Meanwhile, the Climate Campers were acutely aware that they were being falsely depicted to the public as violent &ndash; not just to property but to people. At one point they marched behind a banner declaring: &ldquo;We are armed only with peer review&rdquo;, copies of the latest IPCC report stuck to their hands.</p> <p class="p3">UK ministers had justified spending &pound;5.9 million on policing the Kingsnorth protest by saying that 70 officers had been injured. However, a freedom of information request later showed that of the 1,500 officers deployed at the camp, there were only 12 reportable injuries, none came from direct contact with the protesters, and all were of the lowest level of seriousness. Reported injuries included &ldquo;stung on finger by possible wasp&rdquo;, heatstroke, and &ldquo;used leg to open door and next day had pain in lower back&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">More extreme iterations of protest may well become part of the future of climate politics, but we should ensure that fear-mongering doesn&rsquo;t get used to limit climate protest, or distract from the very real and pressing violence of climate change politics as it already exists &ndash; be that water scarcity in Syria, maladaptation projects in Bangladesh or the multitude of ways in which the legacies of colonialism continue to skew the global response.</p> <h2 class="p4">The climate crisis as a security issue</h2> <p class="p5">One of the challenging things about climate change is that it creeps up gradually over time, squeezing already squeezed systems, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and inequalities, heating up everything from gentrification to domestic violence. In California, it intertwines with the prison-industrial complex, as prison inmates are sent to fight wildfires at a fraction of the minimum wage. This has been happening since the 1940s, but as wildfires get worse, the state relies increasingly on this cheap, captive workforce.</p> <p class="p3">In December, the UN Environment Programme warned that Isis was exploiting water shortages in Iraq and Syria. Climate change isn&rsquo;t the cause of conflict there, but can easily help sustain it. As UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres put it, &ldquo;Climate change is not the source of all ills, but it has a multiplier effect and is an aggravating factor for instability, conflict and terrorism.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">The intelligence community is well aware of the problem. In 1974, the CIA penned a report on &ldquo;climatological research as it pertains to intelligence problems&rdquo;, which warned of new geopolitical risks coming with the emergence of a new climatic era, especially with regards to food shortages and migration. The report argued this new era was well underway, but had started in parts of the world that tended to be ignored. It predicted that soon, these poorer countries wouldn&rsquo;t just be paying attention, but would try to fight back with weapons aimed at returning the weather to how it was. Crucially, the report warned, the weather doesn&rsquo;t keep to lines drawn on a map. Once modified by one nation, weather events might spill over to <br />another country and ignite conflict.</p> <p class="p5">The idea that people could find ways to deliberately change the weather has been around for centuries, enjoying particular popularity just after the Second World War. As Jacob Darwin Hamblin notes in <em>Arming Mother Nature</em>, by the mid-20th-century military scientists had weaponised medicine, chemistry and even nuclear physics, so why not use the Earth itself against your enemies?</p> <p class="p3">Several high-profile attempts have been made at changing the weather. In 1945, secret research went public when a team at General Electric led by Nobel Prize-winner Irving Langmuir appeared to make it snow in Massachusetts, after &ldquo;seeding&rdquo; clouds by throwing dry ice into them. Five years later, Langmuir made the cover of <em>Time</em> with work using silver iodine to create rain. It made such an impact on the public imagination that when, in the early 1950s, mainstream media like the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Scientific American</em> started to discuss early signs of what we would now call the climate crisis, they were keen to stress that man-made climate change wasn&rsquo;t just Irving Langmuir at it again.</p> <p class="p3">Today, although stories of cloud-seeding still circulate on a small scale, the CIA report reads as ageing sci-fi. But they weren&rsquo;t alone in their analysis. In 1975, anthropologist Margaret Mead also got an early bout of climate crisis anxiety, and pulled together a group to develop a social science perspective on the issue. Her report suggested developing countries should be given support to set up their own weather modification programmes.</p> <p class="p3">And the idea hasn&rsquo;t gone away. In 2018, a letter in the journal <em>Nature</em> echoed Mead&rsquo;s concern, arguing that developing countries must take the lead on geoengineering research. Just this spring, a paper in <em>Nature Communications </em>explored how solar radiation management (reflecting more sunlight away from the planet) could impact not just global temperatures but transmission of malaria, warning that in some scenarios, a billion extra people could be at risk of malaria in a geoengineered world.</p> <p class="p3">Greenpeace&rsquo;s Doug Parr once famously described geoengineering research as &ldquo;an expression of political despair&rdquo;; what you do when you&rsquo;ve given up all the other options. But it&rsquo;s worth being politically prepared. We don&rsquo;t always make the best or fairest decisions when we&rsquo;re scared.</p> <h2 class="p4">A fairer future</h2> <p class="p5">As we&rsquo;ve seen, climate change doesn&rsquo;t only impact us directly. It is also a threat multiplier. This will continue to be the case, even as temperatures rise and impacts become more violent. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t build a better world while we also tackle climate change. Indeed, if anything, it&rsquo;s precisely why we have to get to work removing those threats. If you&rsquo;re worried about climate change, join a climate campaign, sure, but we must also prepare by supporting migrants&rsquo; rights groups and mental health charities; fight to unravel legacies of colonialism and gender inequality; build a world where everyone can have access to the greatest advances in science and technology &ndash; be that luxury airships, a life-saving drug, solar-powered heating or the best flood defences.</p> <p class="p3">Or, to put it another way, caring about climate change alone won&rsquo;t build a safe, fair world; fighting for a safer, fairer world will. Could rising climate impacts lead to an increase in eco-fascism? Undoubtedly yes, and we should fight that as we would any other kind of fascism. Could we build a decarbonised world that not only replicates but exacerbates inequalities and human rights abuses endemic in our current fossil fuel economy? Again, it&rsquo;s all too easy to imagine, and again, we should not allow a veneer of <br />environmentalism to justify malign behaviour.</p> <p class="p3">We can&rsquo;t win when it comes to the climate crisis. That (coal-powered) ship sailed a long time ago. But we can win plenty of other fights: fights that will help us to avoid maladaptation, prevent climate change from being used as an excuse for violence, and help us survive the coming storms. It&rsquo;s not just high time we saved &ldquo;the planet&rdquo;, but ourselves.</p> <div class="col-9"> <div class="mceContentBody mt-3"> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><img title="Carnival of the dead, Mexico" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/skulls1.jpeg" height="1026" alt="Carnival of the dead" width="1600" /></strong></span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>All the Living and the Dead (Raven Books) </strong></span><span class="s2">by Hayley Campbell<br /><br /></span><span class="s1"><strong>This Party&rsquo;s Dead (Unbound) </strong></span><span class="s2">by Erica Buist </span></p> <p class="p3">Our awareness of our own mortality, and attempts to keep death at bay, are arguably the reason we do anything at all. The fear of ceasing to exist has fuelled entire religions and often tediously complicated visions of the afterlife. So is death the biggest subject of them all? The authors of two new books on the theme &ndash; Hayley Campbell and Erica Buist &ndash; would probably say so. &ldquo;We all find ways, regardless of our beliefs, to believe in our own immortality,&rdquo; writes Buist. &ldquo;Some of us, ahem, write books.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">Both authors are based in the UK, and it can seem like the British are particularly dreadful at confronting death head-on. It is not that dying is taboo: we are in fact surrounded by it. &ldquo;Death is everywhere, but it&rsquo;s veiled, or it&rsquo;s fiction,&rdquo; writes Campbell in <em>All the Living and the Dead</em>. &ldquo;Just like in video games, the bodies disappear.&rdquo; Buist makes a similar point, in <em>This Party&rsquo;s Dead</em>, that our entertainment empires are built on piles of corpses. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;when it comes to our own, we blanch.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">These books are interested in why we fear death, and how best to confront our preoccupation with it. Campbell tackles these questions in a journalistic manner, by talking to people in the death trade and seeking out &ldquo;unromantic, unpoetic, unsanitised visions of death&rdquo;. Buist&rsquo;s is a more personal journey, starting with a definite trigger: discovering the body of her soon-to-be father-in-law, eight days after his death at a relatively young age. This traumatic moment leads her on a journey around the globe, to seven festivals or &ldquo;parties&rdquo; where they celebrate the dead.</p> <p class="p4">Despite their different approaches, the books share some common refrains. One is around silence. &ldquo;Nobody wants to say the wrong thing, so nobody says anything,&rdquo; as Campbell puts it. As we hear through her interviewees, this squeamishness can be counterproductive, to say the least. She writes at various points about it being better for a loved one to see a dead body &ndash; closure is important, even if it is of a gruesome kind. Buist draws the same conclusion: in Nepal, Indonesia and Sicily, people are hands-on with the dead, even, in Madagascar, digging them back up every seven years to party with them.</p> <p class="p4">Both authors are also interested in the gendered aspect of death. &ldquo;Men weren&rsquo;t interested in deathcare until they thought they could make money from it,&rdquo; says one of Buist&rsquo;s interviewees. Campbell writes that before the business of death became commercialised, &ldquo;The bookends of life were considered to be the realm of women.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">Now the death industry is a significant part of the global economy, and one that Campbell explores with an interest that is infectious. You can almost see her, notebook and dictaphone in hand, taking in the smells and the often horrific sights as she talks to an embalmer, a grave digger or a maker of death masks. (She can apparently watch bodies being hacked apart with few qualms.)</p> <p class="p4">Buist&rsquo;s writing, meanwhile, is more novelistic and self-conscious. Her characters can sometimes come across as conduits for heart-warming messages that are a little too neat for comfort:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p6">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got it all, and we&rsquo;ve just got to face it, never deny it, and never fear death. Dance with the dead. Dance with death, and it&rsquo;ll teach you the right steps.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p4">That said, it&rsquo;s a book full of parties, so it would be unfair to criticise it for being too upbeat. And there are lessons to be learned here, especially for the British, about how we could change our attitude to death for the better. In Sicily, for example, the dead leave presents for the living, like <br />Father Christmas. This kind of celebration seems more fun, as well as more sensible. As Buist writes, &ldquo;I imagined growing up associating the dead with a treasure hunt, a sugar hit and a gift, instead of an awkward silence, averted gazes and the obligatory muttering of &lsquo;very sad&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">But there are, to put it bluntly, simply more interesting insights and arresting details in <em>All the Living and the Dead</em>. Campbell meets people with horribly fascinating jobs: a crime scene cleaner who wipes up after a brain has sprayed up a wall; anatomical pathology technologists who have to sew dead babies&rsquo; heads back together; someone from a disaster response service that anticipates mass fatalities so that your company doesn&rsquo;t have to. Her similes &ndash; describing, for example, a complex tumour as wrapping its way down a person&rsquo;s spine &ldquo;like the red stripe on a barber&rsquo;s pole&rdquo; &ndash; beg to be underlined. She has nightmares after seeing a dead baby fall helplessly underwater while being washed, yet resists the urge to become sentimental. &ldquo;I try to suppress every built-in urge to stop him drowning,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;telling myself he is dead, realising that he is dead, that nothing I do here would matter or change the outcome of his being dead.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">Campbell&rsquo;s book is also just recent enough to feature an afterword that acknowledges the coronavirus pandemic &ndash; an event so far-reaching that it has warped all of our experiences of mortality, as war would have done in the 20th century. After being witness to so much death, Campbell pictured each person as a body in a bag, not a statistic.</p> <p class="p4"><em>All the Living and the Dead</em> triumphs in its mission statement: the reflections from the death workers are very unromantic indeed. Campbell draws conclusions, but these are not cliches. &ldquo;By shielding ourselves from what happens past the moment of death,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;we deny ourselves a deeper understanding of who we truly are.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4"><em>This Party&rsquo;s Dead</em> also achieves its aim, in the sense that it seems to have partly been an attempt to find comfort for the author &ndash; and may, along the way, provide the same to us as readers. After trekking to several continents, Buist concludes, &ldquo;Festivals for the dead aren&rsquo;t for the dead, really. They&rsquo;re for us.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">Despite the billions of words others have scribbled down about death, both Buist&rsquo;s and Campbell&rsquo;s books add something significant to the literature. Death can galvanise a writer to raise their game. As the ultimate subject, its wordcount is rivalled perhaps only by love. It will continue to be the most immense inspiration, as long as we are unable to escape its clutches. The upside here is that we&rsquo;ll be treated to a lot more fabulous books.</p> <p class="p4"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p4"><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/process.jpeg" height="345" alt="Process" width="500" /></strong></p> <p class="p4"><strong>process (verb)</strong> <em>1530s, &ldquo;begin legal action against&rdquo; from French processer &ldquo;to prosecute&rdquo;</em></p> <p class="p6">In April, a <em>UN New</em>s story said: &ldquo;A deal reportedly made by the United Kingdom to send some migrants for processing and relocation to the Central African nation of Rwanda, are at odds with States&rsquo; responsibility to take care of those in need of protection.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p7">The word &ldquo;processing&rdquo; cropped up in quite a few news stories on this subject. It is reminiscent of other forms of processing which give us such things as processed cheese and processed meat.</p> <p class="p7">The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that the first use of &ldquo;process&rdquo; to mean putting people through a legal process started in Scotland at the end of the 15th century. In 1532, for example, someone would be &ldquo;processit&rdquo; for not paying tax. Processing food crops up first in the US (1878) when glucose was added to honey. Six years later we hear of ozone being added to meat to make it processed. Our supermarkets have been full of processed food ever since.</p> <p class="p7">The specific use of &ldquo;process&rdquo; to mean subjecting a person to registration seems to begin in the 1920s, again in the US. The <em>New York Times </em>reported in 1925 that policemen were &ldquo;processed&rdquo; before being given uniforms. By 1935 (still in the US), we find applicants being put through medical examinations and &ldquo;transported to army camps to be &lsquo;processed&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p7">We get a sense that people began to find the word discomforting; the <em>Times Literary Supplement </em>noted in 1959 that some great books of French culture about &ldquo;wild boys&rdquo; like Maupassant or Gauguin were being processed, &ldquo;attractively jacketed, to emerge as items suitable for ticking off on library lists&rdquo;. Even more explicitly uneasy is one D. Ginsberg saying in 2000 that he &ldquo;checked into the main office and was processed like a piece of salmon caught in a net&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p7">So it is in 2022, we wait and see if Rwanda will indeed set up &ldquo;processing centres&rdquo; for people who tried to come to the UK. Lord Alf Dubs, a former &ldquo;kindertransport&rdquo; child, is determined that the &ldquo;process&rdquo; won&rsquo;t happen. He, more than anyone, knows how human beings were processed during the horrors of the mid-20th century.</p> <p class="p7"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. </em><em><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This little moment goes some way to capture the atmosphere of HowTheLightGetsIn, a festival billed as a &ldquo;playground for the soul&rdquo; that this year features leading thinkers from across the fields of philosophy, science, culture and politics, with music and comedy thrown in the mix. Running alongside the well-established Hay Festival of Literature and Arts since 2018, HTLGI has more than outgrown initial assumptions that it might be some kind of &ldquo;Hay fringe&rdquo;, with big hitters like Richard Dawkins and Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Penrose starring alongside an impressive diversity of thinkers, and plenty of music and comedy from afro-futurist beats to philosophers and comedians joining forces in midnight sessions of intellectual jousting.</p> <p>The talk with the bare feet saw Slavoj Zizek and Yuval Harari discuss the idea of &ldquo;nature&rdquo; and interrogate why we associate the natural with the good. Zizek, the Hegelian provocateur, and Harari, historian and author of the best-selling <em>Sapiens: a Brief History of Humankind</em>, don&rsquo;t make an immediately intuitive pair, but after a mutual agreement between the two to do away entirely with the natural / unnatural binary itself (in Harari&rsquo;s words &ldquo;everything that is possible is also natural&rdquo;), there followed a wonderfully wide-ranging debate touching on the deep ecology movement, the definition of the good, and the frightening possibilities of gene editing creating a new species of &ldquo;human 2.0&rdquo;.</p> <p>Inter-disciplinary is definitely the watchword at HTGLI. A debate on the "World In Jeopardy" was quite rightly dominated by the Russia-Ukraine war, with former member of the British Secret Intelligence Service Nigel Inkster debating with Labour MP Tulip Siddiq and the conservative cultural critic and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple. &ldquo;Dreams and Jeopardy&rdquo; is the theme of this year&rsquo;s festival and it feels right to step back for a moment from the news cycle to pose the big questions around the war: Is the west in decline? Do we need another global hegemon, now that the United States appears to have eschewed its role as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s policeman&rdquo;?</p> <p>When <a href="/articles/5960/were-bringing-philosophy-into-british-culture">I talked to Hilary Lawson</a>, the founder, before the festival, he spoke about the importance of politicians engaging with these fundamental questions. In practice however, as it turns out, it may not always run smoothly. Although I didn&rsquo;t attend myself, the buzz around the food and drink tents today, the first day of the festival, was somewhat dominated by the afternoon session with Matt Hancock, whose talk on his &ldquo;life and philosophy&rdquo; prompted more than one critic of his conduct as health secretary during the pandemic to heckle from the audience - one loudly calling him a &ldquo;hypocrite&rdquo; after he alluded to the crucial virtue of &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;.</p> <p>However, if the motive is bringing philosophy alive, visceral responses should be expected. And the festival certainly lives up to its brief of encouraging lively debate, inside and outside the sessions themselves. The lack of any real VIP areas means that speakers and artists are drifting around with the guests. At lunch, simply by virtue of sitting near to the South Indian dosa stall, I found myself discussing the life of the prophet and Islamic history with Zizek and Myriam Francois, a journalist and research associate at the Centre of Islamic Studies. Lawson had promised me a festival in which people &ldquo;genuinely do mix &hellip;. You might be standing next to the world's leading scientist in a particular area, or a major politician. It also means that those people are really engaged. And we involve music and comedy and those sorts of things, because it softens all of that status stuff. I mean, we all have to deal with the fact that, you know, life is a really puzzling thing.&rdquo;</p> <p>It is indeed, and particularly at this fraught point of history, with climate crisis and major shifts in geopolitics recurring as themes throughout the day. Reflecting on these big questions can often be a lonely, silent past-time. But now, I&rsquo;m about to go re-join the noise and lights, to dance it out with Groove Armada&rsquo;s Tom Findlay, then maybe a late-night ride on the Ferris Wheel. That&rsquo;s what this festival provides: four days of intellectual stimulation, yes, but also some much-needed distance from the churn of news and the stress of daily life, inviting you to listen, learn, and see the wood for the trees for once. (And it helps that from this spot on the Welsh border, there are a lot of beautiful woods to see.)</p> <p><em>New Humanist magazine is Philosophy Partner of HowTheLightGetsIn festival.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="A still from &quot;Station Eleven&quot;" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/StationEleven.jpeg" height="1067" alt="A still from 'Station Eleven'" width="1600" /></p> <p class="p1">In March 2020, it felt like those of us who were lucky enough to be able to lock down in our homes and watch a lot of television were quickly sorted into two opposing camps. There were those who sought out a total escape from the daily accumulation of death tolls. Absurdist documentaries like Netflix&rsquo;s <em>Tiger King</em> and endless dating reality shows were this group&rsquo;s binging material. But alongside them co-existed the people who wanted to immerse themselves in fictional versions of their current situation, rather than look away. Pandemic-based films like <em>Contagion</em>, <em>28 Days Later</em>, <em>Outbreak</em> and others provided this hit of schadenfreude, filling our screens with safely contained versions of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; even as a real-life virus raged through our communities.</p> <p class="p3">These, and indeed many other conventional disaster movies, follow a simple narrative template. The viewer is introduced to the central characters before The Event that will utterly change their lives, either in early scenes or via flashbacks to life before. Initially, the warning signs of the cataclysm are ignored by many, until it is too late to prevent the inevitable. Transmission of the virus surges exponentially, millions die, and our remaining heroes are left to make the best of the life that remains to them in the post-apocalyptic landscape. Invariably, human life finds a way to endure, albeit in much altered and reduced circumstances. To put it another way: it is extremely rare for a mainstream pandemic thriller to end with the camera panning over an empty planet heaped with corpses.</p> <h2 class="p3">"Station Eleven" and breaking new ground</h2> <p class="p3">There is something gratifying about the rhythms of this basic story. It takes a terrifying, incomprehensible unknown and slots it into a familiar structure with a beginning, middle and end. But having now lived through two years and counting of a major viral pandemic, we know that such an event is anything but neat and compartmentalised. Imaginary pandemics will forever hit differently for us, now we have first-hand experience of the chaos such a situation can create in the lives of even the luckiest survivor. With this knowledge has come an appetite for a different kind of on-screen pandemic &ndash; something that reflects the true complexities of life with a deadly virus and resists the easy categorisation of everyone as either &ldquo;victim&rdquo; or &ldquo;survivor&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">The best example of this new wave of fictional pandemics was, surprisingly, imagined long before the SARS‑CoV‑2 virus was first identified. Emily St John Mandel&rsquo;s novel <em>Station Eleven </em>was published in 2014 and follows a group of travelling players touring the Great Lakes region of North America 20 years after a virulent strain of swine flu has wiped out most of the population. Although critically acclaimed from the start, it wasn&rsquo;t until 2020 that the book went stratospheric, selling hundreds of thousands of copies.</p> <p class="p3">A film adaptation had been in the works since 2015, but in late 2019 this was revealed to have been transformed into a television series for the HBO Max streaming service. By the time the show aired in 2021, the world had been altered irrevocably by events that bore an uncanny similarity to those of the plot.</p> <p class="p3">Yet <em>Station Eleven</em> is worth watching regardless of its coincidental mirroring of reality. Mandel&rsquo;s story, unlike some of the big-budget pandemic thrillers that scratched that early itch for manageable terror, is small in scale. It focuses tightly on the creative and emotional lives of her main characters. As is the case with real people, their past relationships and traumas inform their present-day behaviour far more than the big-picture facts about a flu virus. The virus intrudes only insofar as it is relevant to their daily existence. There are no forced flashbacks showing what the US president was doing the moment that the virus hit, or dramatic scenes where epidemiologists summarise the worldwide prognosis.</p> <p class="p3">The show is emotional and dark in places, but it is also, audaciously, uplifting. Hinting that people who have suffered through horrible things can also sometimes enjoy the life they still have feels daring, almost taboo, but at our current moment it is deeply satisfying."</p> <h2 class="p3">"Sweet Tooth" and "Creamery": a new breed of story?</h2> <p class="p3"><em>Sweet Tooth,</em> a 2021 adaptation of a comic book of the same name, uses whimsy and fantasy to achieve a similarly broad emotional range. In this scenario, society has ten years prior experienced &ldquo;the Great Crumble&rdquo;, because of a pandemic known only as &ldquo;the Sick&rdquo;. As a result, most of the world&rsquo;s humans were killed and human-animal hybrid babies emerged. Gus, a half-deer half-child, has been left alone in the woods after the death of his father. He thus sets out on his own at the age of ten to find his absent mother.</p> <p class="p3">The show is visually gorgeous, setting this cute antlered child in a series of sweeping forest landscapes. The beauty all around him contrasts with Gus&rsquo;s ambient fear. He is being hunted by a band of humans known as &ldquo;the Last Men&rdquo;, who fear that these hybrid children were the cause, rather than the result, of the pandemic. The Sick not only killed people, it also destroyed the survivors&rsquo; ability to interact without suspicion. As a portrayal of a pandemic&rsquo;s ripple effect, it is potent.</p> <p class="p5">Seriousness is another boundary that creators of post-Covid pandemics are beginning to push. Contagion and death are not traditionally fertile grounds for comedy, but choosing to laugh at horrible things can sometimes tease out greater nuance than a purely po-faced treatment. This is definitely the case in <em>Creamerie</em>, a late 2021 comedy-horror show from New Zealand that follows a trio of women running a dairy farm eight years after a viral pandemic has wiped out most of the world&rsquo;s men. Although free of the patriarchal dynamics that govern other post-apocalyptic fertility-orientated stories such as <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em>, the working women of <em>Creamerie</em> still find themselves oppressed by a fascist authority. But this one is run by authoritarian women and uses &ldquo;wellness&rdquo; practices to achieve its ends. Part black comedy, part satire, part crime caper, it can feel unsettling at first to laugh at the show&rsquo;s jabs at wellness mantras alongside flashbacks to the gory pyres of male corpses. But when the women discover a man who has survived the extermination and decide to help him evade capture by the sperm-obsessed wellness authorities, the emotional stakes are raised.</p> <p class="p3">Bobby, played by a former <em>Neighbours</em> star, needs their generosity and courage to survive, even if he is physically stronger than the women in authority. The mixture of camaraderie, jadedness and hope exhibited by the central characters is recognisable. In amongst the dirty jokes and Gwyneth Paltrow-esque platitudes &ndash; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an &lsquo;us&rsquo; in every uterus!&rdquo; they chant at one point &ndash; is a familiar tale about power and who gets to wield it in difficult times.</p> <p class="p3">All three of these post-Covid pandemic portrayals are set years after the initial outbreak. One of the overriding lessons of the last two years has been that pandemics don&rsquo;t end as neatly as the classic disaster film might have once led us to believe. Rather than being short and sharp, this is a calamity that unfolds slowly, intertwining with our existing lives, rather than blotting them out in one convenient detonation. It&rsquo;s no wonder that we now prefer pandemic dramas that engage with the myriad ways in which these creeping tendrils of fear can change us and how we live &ndash; for the worse, of course, but also for the better.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro.

This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>
