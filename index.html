<p>We went out to a movie &#8212; <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10223460/"><i>Marry Me</i></a>, a silly little trifle with an absurd premise (big famous pop star, Jennifer Lopez, discovers the man she was about to marry was cheating on her, so she picks a random guy out of her audience, Owen Wilson, and asks him to marry her. He accepts. Best part of the movie was when they go through the ceremony, the guy is asked &#8220;do you take this woman yadda yadda&#8221;, and he answers &#8220;OK&#8221; in a nasal Owen Wilson voice. Perfect. The rest was anticlimactic.)</p>
<p>Normally, I wouldn&#8217;t even consider going to this kind of movie, but it seemed thematically appropriate to the occasion.</p>

<p>You might think the evening had nowhere to go but up from there, except…when we visited our granddaughter earlier this week, she had a bad cold and a runny nose. Guess who got it? Me. I have been turned into a horrible snot monster. That&#8217;s an actual photo of me. I&#8217;ll spare you the sound effects, which are gross and glurbly.</p>
<p>Bad enough, you say, but then Mary got savagely sick. More ghastly wimperings, lying on the bathroom floor, I was kicked out of my slimy sleeping nest a few times.</p>
<p>Then the cat started vomiting in sympathy.</p>
<p>And now, my spring break is more than half over, and I have to get grading done.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="A portrait of Major Mahomed Akbar Khan by Henry Lamb is hung in the Second World War Gallery at IWM London" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/iwm.jpg" height="981" alt="Hanging a portrait of Major Mahomed Akbar Khan at IWM London" width="1531" /></p> <p>An unknown Ethiopian artist&rsquo;s impression of the invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 painted on an antelope&rsquo;s hide, a jigsaw puzzle made of Nazi swastikas, and a flat iron pan from the Partition of India in 1947. It&rsquo;s through objects such as these that the Imperial War Museum in London is hoping to offer visitors a bold global look at the Second World War.<br /><br />In October the museum opened the doors to its new Second World War and Holocaust galleries after a massive &pound;30.7m reimagining. It&rsquo;s the first major redevelopment of the museum&rsquo;s permanent representation of the Second World War since 1989. A lot has changed. Gone are the hugely popular war &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; of the 1990s, where you could walk through a recreated bombed-out street or trench. Instead, the museum shows the different global environments &ndash; desert, tropics, tundra &ndash; that the war took place in. Experiences of civilians, rather than battles or weaponry, are now front and centre. <br /><br />Links are made between the War Galleries and the new Holocaust Galleries, both through narrative and a shared exhibition space. But it is the rendering of the Second World War that is a significant departure for IWM. Why was it done now? And does it succeed? <br /><br />Every British schoolchild has been taught the stories of Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain. Along with endless repeats of Dad&rsquo;s Army, and the &ldquo;Great Escape&rdquo; sung at football matches, it can seem as if the Second World War is ever-present in British culture. It was weaponised during the 2016 EU referendum by both sides: Nigel Farage invoked the trope of Britain &ldquo;alone&rdquo; fighting the Germans, while the Remain camp argued that the conflict taught us the need for close ties with the continent. At the beginning of the pandemic, then-health minister Matt Hancock went so far as to compare Britain&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic with the national resilience shown during the Blitz.</p> <h2>The vital role of museums</h2> <p>But these takes often have more to do with Britain&rsquo;s culture wars than with historical accuracy. As the last generation that actually survived the war passes away, the role of museums in cutting through the confusion and forging a clearer relationship between the public, the politicians and our national collective memory of the war becomes ever more necessary. <br /><br />We live in an age of emotion, with a need for personal connection. The stories of more than 100 individuals from 30 different countries are told in the new galleries, part of a wider trend in the museum sector called &ldquo;peopling&rdquo;, where personal lives are given space, along with the more abstract narratives of movements and battles. Take Sam Martinez, for instance. Martinez, whose passport is displayed, was an &ldquo;Axeman&rdquo; from British Honduras (now Belize) who rushed to Glasgow to contribute to the war effort. We learn not just of his bravery but of the prejudice he faced: while invited to dances in Scotland, he would also hear local leaders complain about &ldquo;black foresters starting relationships with Scottish women&rdquo;. <br /><br />Discovering his story, we empathise with his courage and determination and acknowledge the acute racial tensions of the era &ndash; although the museum stops short of calling this what we would now recognise it as: racism. Still, it&rsquo;s important to remember that racism itself is an evolving historical concept: the racism experienced today is different to racism as it was experienced during the time of the British Empire. What we do see in these stories is an institution tentatively coming to terms with some of the legacies of Britain&rsquo;s imperial past. The new galleries hope to tell a &ldquo;global story&rdquo;. That includes the former British Empire, but it also extends to the Soviet Union, eastern Europe, North Africa and the Mediterranean. Special attention is given to China, as well as the Japanese and Allied campaign in East Asia and the Pacific. <br /><br />That&rsquo;s not to say it shies away from representations of the war in Britain. However, it does seek to clarify the facts. One way in which the British story of the war has been warped in the popular imagination is the idea of Britain singlehandedly fighting the Nazis, following the fall of France and much of Europe to German occupation. In reality, Britain was very much not &ldquo;alone&rdquo;, relying heavily on its empire for resources, financial support &ndash; and, of course, troops. In exposing its historical inaccuracy, the Imperial War Museum, London shows how this idea erases the contribution and exploitation of millions of individuals across the globe. <br /><br />It is the hope of many historians and museum professionals that realigning the narrative in public spaces like the IWM will exact real political change, encouraging the public to recognise when their politicians, and national press, are touting phony historical equivalencies.<br /><br />The new galleries also want to expand the concept of the Second World War as a &ldquo;Total War&rdquo;, in which the distinction between civilian and combatant is made redundant and entire nations and their populations are mobilised for the war effort. Dr Yasmin Khan, who advised on the new galleries, says: &ldquo;The war touched many parts of the globe far from the usual epicentres or theatres, and impinged on civilian lives in myriad ways: social, economic, political, from food shortages to internment or deforestation. So part of the new approach to the war is to try and understand this total effect, the way that so many aspects of human life were shaped &ndash; often far away from the frontlines, in places we might not immediately associate with the war. This is what I think the new galleries achieve.&rdquo;<br /><br />Indeed, as IWM curator Kate Clements adds, &ldquo;By drawing comparisons between, for example, the experience of civilians being bombed in Britain, Japan, Germany and China, we are able to demonstrate that although the effects of war were felt to different degrees, in different places and at different times, there was a commonality of experience in the war that collectively bound together those millions that lived through it.&rdquo;<br /><br />Hence the museum does not hold back when showing the horrors of war: visitors will learn that in 1941, two million out of the three million Soviet prisoners held by the Germans died within six months, either through starvation or neglect. Similarly, sexual violence &ndash; an often-underexplored aspect of the war &ndash; is shown through the stories of so-called &ldquo;comfort women&rdquo;, those forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army. Starvation and hunger are explored via the controversial starving of roughly 3 million people in British-controlled Bengal.</p> <h2>The "anti-woke" backlash</h2> <p>So, has the IWM succeeded? While generally met with positive reviews, its new galleries have not gone without criticism. A recent review by Peter Hitchens suggested that while impressive, too little was included on how Stalin treated Soviet citizens. Similarly, historian Laurence Rees wrote in the Telegraph: &ldquo;No prominence is given to the horrific crimes Stalin committed during the war against his own people&rdquo;, such as the deportation of entire ethnic groups like the Kalmyks, Crimean Tatars and Chechens.<br /><br />These critics have a point. After all, the Soviet Union did suffer the highest number of wartime casualties and the stories of those abused and murdered by its regime should be fully told. However, we shouldn&rsquo;t ignore the context of these criticisms. After Labour&rsquo;s Jeremy Corbyn years and amid the rising popularity of left-wing politics among young Brits, there is a hint of moral panic around calls to emphasise communist atrocities in culture and academia: a pertinent example of how the war is still being used as a point of reference for contemporary debate.<br /><br />Fears over &ldquo;woke&rdquo; or left-wing education have led to calls for new public spaces which provide a counternarrative. This includes a newly proposed museum to communist atrocities, the board members of which include former Conservative MP Owen Paterson and MEP Daniel Hannan. The would-be director of the museum, James Bartholomew, who is also a former Brexit Party candidate, said last year that teachers &ldquo;who, if not Marxist themselves, are left-wing&rdquo; are to blame for a lack of knowledge about communist atrocities.<br /><br />The same fears over how Britain&rsquo;s past is represented came into play after the National Trust published its report in September 2020 investigating the proven links of some of its properties to the slave trade. The backlash against perceived &ldquo;wokeness&rdquo; led to the foundation of the protest group Restore Trust, which lists amongst its main aims to &ldquo;restore the [National] Trust&rsquo;s original apolitical ethos&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Challenging uncomfortable histories</h2> <p>The government itself is certainly not shy of engaging in these culture wars. Following concerns over the Black Lives Matter movement and the toppling of statues in the US and the UK, then-culture secretary Oliver Dowden sent a letter in September last year to institutions funded by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport implying that their funding could be at risk if they removed controversial statues or objects.<br /><br />Many museums will be watching cautiously. Having lost so much revenue during the pandemic, it would be understandable for some to shy away from taking a bold stance in their representation of the past. <br /><br />Nevertheless, it is more important now than ever that museums continue to question and challenge uncomfortable histories. They would be doing a disservice to the public if their representations of the past were mediocre, or boring, for the sake of avoiding debate and controversy. As the war generation leave us, being able to interact with authentic material culture from the time is even more important for our ability to resist simplistic culture war debates.<br /><br />The new galleries at the IWM are not without fault, and invariably miss out histories that do not fit into either their overarching narrative or exhibition space. But their attempt to offer a more global look at the Second World War is admirable, as is their foregrounding of personal stories, along with the complexities of economic, social and military histories. They offer something that is rarely found on the internet, in political rhetoric or in newspaper columns: the nuanced insights generated by the coupling of historical lives and extraordinary objects.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition.</em> <em><span class="Apple-converted-space"><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</span></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Everything she touches turns to poison. If you&#8217;ve never heard of her, she&#8217;s a notorious Minnesota hate-monger, a nasty, more bitter version of Michele Bachmann. She&#8217;s the <a href="http://thecolu.mn/10275/meet-team-behind-minnesota-child-protection-league">master hater behind the Minnesota Child Protection League</a>, one of those misleadingly-named right-wing organizations that swoops into schools to protect the kids from bullying, which usually translates into defending the bullies right to torment LGBT kids. She&#8217;s simply an awful person.</p>
<blockquote><p>MCPL’s lead spokesperson is Barb Anderson, a ubiquitous figure in the school bullying debate. Anderson has long volunteered as a researcher for the Minnesota Family Council, which led two failed battles against marriage equality. She was also a vocal opponent of LGBT safety in the Anoka-Hennepin School District where she helped launch the Parents Action League. PAL is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center because of its adamant demands to have the ex-gay movement in the Anoka-Hennepin School District.</p>
<p>Anderson has made some extreme statements about LGBT people, so much so that GLAAD has added her to its Commentator Accountability Project.</p>
<p>For example, she once said, “The greatest threat to our freedom and the health and well-being of our children is from this radical homosexual agenda that is just so pervasive.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She was bad news several years ago, when a wave of suicides was sweeping through the Anoka-Hennepin school district &#8212; nine kids dead by their own hand in a couple of years. It was horrific. The <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/one-towns-war-on-gay-teens-232572/">school district was highlighted in a <i>Rolling Stone</i></a> (Massive trigger warning: that article recounts the personal experiences of many young people who were viciously bullied, and graphically describes several suicides).</p>
<blockquote><p>There was another common thread: Four of the nine dead were either gay or perceived as such by other kids, and were reportedly bullied. The tragedies come at a national moment when bullying is on everyone’s lips, and a devastating number of gay teens across the country are in the news for killing themselves. Suicide rates among gay and lesbian kids are frighteningly high, with attempt rates four times that of their straight counterparts; studies show that one-third of all gay youth have attempted suicide at some point (versus 13 percent of hetero kids), and that internalized homophobia contributes to suicide risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Administrators denied that there was a problem with gay kids being bullied. They want to stop <em>all</em> bullying, which is a common defense for avoiding conflict with special interest groups targeting LGBT rights. They can&#8217;t possibly single out LGBT kids for protection, despite the fact that they&#8217;re getting bullied <em>because</em> they&#8217;re LGBT. They won&#8217;t even acknowledge that the behavior of these kids is perfectly normal, so they avoid useful approaches, like inclusive sex education. No, they just close their eyes to the issues, because they&#8217;d rather offend families of the bullied kids than the MCPL. They&#8217;ll even go so far as to blame &#8220;gay activists&#8221; for the problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Center for Lesbian Rights have filed a lawsuit on behalf of five students, alleging the school district’s policies on gays are not only discriminatory, but also foster an environment of unchecked anti-gay bullying. The Department of Justice has begun a civil rights investigation as well. The Anoka-Hennepin school district declined to comment on any specific incidences but denies any discrimination, maintaining that its broad anti-bullying policy is meant to protect all students. “We are not a homophobic district, and to be vilified for this is very frustrating,” says superintendent Dennis Carlson, who blames right-wingers and gay activists for choosing the area as a battleground, describing the district as the victim in this fracas. “People are using kids as pawns in this political debate,” he says. “I find that abhorrent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is explicitly Barb Anderson&#8217;s approach. If LGBT kids are being bullied and committing suicide, that&#8217;s the fault of the kids themselves and of schools that permissively tolerate the <q>pied piper of perversion</q> and that <q>GSAs [Gay-Straight Alliances] will draw more confused and questioning youth into gay experimentation</q> which will lead schools to <q>affirm sexual disorders</q>, which is why all those kids killed themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anti-gay backlash was instant. Minnesota Family Council president Tom Prichard blogged that Justin’s suicide could only be blamed upon one thing: his gayness. “Youth who embrace homosexuality are at greater risk [of suicide], because they’ve embraced an unhealthy sexual identity and lifestyle,” Prichard wrote. Anoka-Hennepin conservatives formally organized into the Parents Action League, declaring opposition to the “radical homosexual” agenda in schools. Its stated goals, advertised on its website, included promoting Day of Truth, providing resources for students “seeking to leave the homosexual lifestyle,” supporting the neutrality policy and targeting “pro-gay activist teachers who fail to abide by district policies.”</p>
<p>Asked on a radio program whether the anti-gay agenda of her ilk bore any responsibility for the bullying and suicides, Barb Anderson, co-author of the original “No Homo Promo,” held fast to her principles, blaming pro-gay groups for the tragedies. She explained that such “child corruption” agencies allow “quote-unquote gay kids” to wrongly feel legitimized. “And then these kids are locked into a lifestyle with their choices limited, and many times this can be disastrous to them as they get into the behavior which leads to disease and death,” Anderson said. She added that if LGBT kids weren’t encouraged to come out of the closet in the first place, they wouldn’t be in a position to be bullied.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s deja vu all over again. The Anoka-Hennepin catastrophe, fomented by Barb Anderson and her cronies, was nine years ago. So she pulled up stakes and moved to another school district to dispense her venom. The latest episode? The Becker school district invited the MCPL and Barb Anderson to present an alternative view point at a meeting of the school board.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. The fools running the Becker school district invited a known hate group to speak to the board about adopting their hateful policies. <a href="https://www.startribune.com/becker-students-protest-as-anti-lgbt-group-presents-to-school-board/600156153/">So they did</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The school board invited the Child Protection League to speak at a special meeting following outrage from some community members when OutFront Minnesota — an organization supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights — presented at an August meeting.</p>
<p>The Child Protection League describes itself as an organization committed to protecting children from exploitation and indoctrination. Barb Anderson helped form the group, along with the Parents Action League, which was designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for its anti-gay rhetoric and involvement in the Anoka-Hennepin School District when it saw a rash of suicides and a lawsuit claiming the district didn&#8217;t respond to harassment on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>
<p>GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, also lists Anderson on an anti-LGBT watchlist for saying LGBTQ antibullying efforts are the &#8220;pied piper of perversion&#8221; and affirm sexual disorders.</p>
<p>Anderson was not at Monday&#8217;s meeting but Child Protection League Board Chair Julie Quist spoke about children&#8217;s books she said violated the beliefs and norms of the community by accepting different gender identities. Quist previously served as district director for U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann. Also speaking were former Becker board members Betsy Armstrong and Chris Klippen.</p>
<p>Armstrong spoke for about 50 minutes and was interrupted several times by protesters — mostly Becker students — questioning her statements or chanting &#8220;gay rights are human rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke mostly about what she called the &#8220;worrisome&#8221; increase in the number of transgender youth in the last decade and cited possible reasons as anxiety, autism or sexual trauma exacerbated by peer and social media influences — something Armstrong called a &#8220;social contagion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armstrong also referenced a Bible quote that says God created two sexes — male and female — and said people who follow religious teachings are constitutionally protected and their opinions ought to be given equal consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice one aspect of their tactics: emphasizing trans kids. Focusing on gay kids, while still something they do, has had diminishing returns as homosexuality is gradually, increasingly acceptable. Trans kids are fair game! Let&#8217;s pick on them until the community wakes up to the fact that this all the same horrendous game of finding someone to ostracize and abuse.</p>
<p>The kids are all right, though. They showed up to protest, and were a lot more intelligent than the sick grownups who brought on this spectacle.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hundreds of students, parents, and residents in the Becker, Minnesota School District showed up, mostly to protest, a special presentation by an anti-LGBTQ group that offered what it called an “alternative viewpoint” on transgender people. The group, the Minnesota Child Protection League, has been cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>“This is disgusting,” said Skyler Seiler, identified by Fox9 as a transgender student at the school. “I can’t believe this, we are humans too. I don’t know why they’re treating us like we’re not. Is it not your job, as school board members, to make students feel safe and welcome?”</p>
<p>The school board on Monday voted to allow the group, which Fox9 says is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-LGBTQ hate group, to deliver the special presentation. It’s unclear why the school board agreed to allow a third party organization to deliver a message of hate and discrimination that directly affects the students and families it is supposed to support, protect, and defend. It’s also unclear if that information was vetted or fact-checked before being delivered. Attendees say the group’s information was not from credible sources.</p>
<p>“Human rights don’t have two sides so bringing in another side just doesn’t make sense to me,” Heather Abrahamson told Fox9.</p>
<p>“They were not credible sources that they were citing, and it was completely biased and really offensive and insulting,” Maggie Seiler said. “This is painful, I’m sure those kids in there feel even more ostracized and like the school doesn’t back them and like they have even less rights.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Those kids would be right. It was school board members who brought in the hate-mongers and who argued that &#8220;free speech&#8221; trumps the kids&#8217; right to learn in a safe environment. They don&#8217;t care about the students, prioritizing the horrid discriminatory religious beliefs of people like Barb Anderson over the experiences of people who have to live with the discrimination.</p>
<p>Look, people, you probably don&#8217;t like the optics of citizens turning out en masse to call you a bigot. There&#8217;s a solution: never ever pay attention to hate groups like the MCPL or the Parents Action League or the Minnesota Family Council. Don&#8217;t invite them to your meetings. Burn their recommendations. Drive them out. Or get more of this from the families you claim to support.</p>

They can be heartwarming, tearjerking, shocking &ndash; or, sometimes, so viscerally uncomfortable that they keep replaying in your head long after the episode or even the series is over.<br /><br />&ldquo;What It Takes&rdquo;, the sixth episode of the third series of the HBO drama <em>Succession</em>, ends with just such a moment. Logan Roy, ruthless patriarch of both his family and their media empire, has chosen to support a repugnant, near-fascist presidential nominee and is demanding that his children line up for a photograph with this man. His daughter, who has already aired her opposition to the choice and been ignored, is hovering on the sidelines of the photoshoot refusing to get into frame. This is when Logan (played by a magisterial Brian Cox) walks over to her and in a menacing undertone delivers the killer line. &ldquo;Siobhan, are you part of this family or not?&rdquo; For a second, the choice to answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; flickers across her face. Then she knuckles under, lines up and pastes on a smile for the camera. It&rsquo;s a brutal and brief encapsulation of the show&rsquo;s fundamental tension: the three-way fight between morality, loyalty and self-interest. In Succession, the family always wins even as its members lose.<br /><br />The family saga, of which <em>Succession</em> is merely the most recent and prominent example, has long been a fundamental component of what is generally known as &ldquo;prestige TV&rdquo; &ndash; the big budget, often American series that have captured the cultural zeitgeist over the past three decades. At the same time stuck-at-home viewers were indulging in the second and third series of <em>Succession</em>, they were also delving back into the boxsets that they had never had time for before. And many of those are also family sagas of one sort of another, from <em>The Sopranos</em> to <em>Game of Thrones</em>, which in amongst the dragons and the nudity is an epic tale of dynastic alliances and betrayals.<br /><br />So why are we so hooked on these intergenerational tales of conflict and inheritance? It&rsquo;s partly because a family saga comes with a built-in narrative arc: power and influence must ultimately, no matter how hard ageing members resist, pass down the family tree, because time can only move forward, never back. Then there&rsquo;s the fascination of tracking how different traits and habits are replicated. Logan Roy and his eldest son Kendall are almost never on the same side of any fight, but looking in on their relationship from the outside, the viewer can see that their conflicts are more often because of their similarities than their differences. As subject matter, these tangled fictional genealogies are universally relatable. There might not be any vast media conglomerates or iron thrones to inherit, but we all have families and all families have their tensions. The gravitational pull of the family unit is inescapable: even those who cut all ties still end up defining themselves in opposition to it.<br /><br />Millennia before the current boom in high-quality television, writers were exploring the potential of this kind of storytelling. The Old Testament is one early example: the so-called &ldquo;succession narrative&rdquo; in the second book of Samuel and the first Book of Kings deals with the family history of the royal house of ancient Israel and the battle to accede to the throne of David. The Ancient Greek dramatists were similarly fascinated by the theatrical potential of lineage and inheritance. Sophocles&rsquo; most famous and enduring plays, <em>Oedipus Rex </em>and <em>Antigone</em>, both feature protagonists torn between the competing attractions of duty, desire and independence.</p> <h2>Austen, Dickens and Galsworthy</h2> <p>This obsessive documentation of family conflict was itself inherited by later writers of the western canon. What are the novels of Jane Austen, with their preoccupation with familial relationships and marriage, if not family sagas? Twentieth-century critics frequently chose <em>Bleak House</em> as the greatest of Charles Dickens&rsquo;s novels. It seems no coincidence that it is his most overtly family-orientated story. By placing a seemingly never-ending Court of Chancery case at the heart of the narrative, Dickens exposed the dark and seedy side of our preoccupation with inheritance. Greed and family do not make for a happy mixture.<br /><br />Following in Dickens&rsquo;s footsteps in the early 20th century came John Galsworthy. Beginning in 1906, he published a trio of connected novels known collectively as <em>The Forsyte Saga</em>. Dealing with the lives and property of the titular Forsyte family, these books delicately skewered the upper-middle-class Edwardian snobbishness that had replaced the Victorian priggishness of the previous century. Although Galsworthy was best known for his plays during his own lifetime, it is this trilogy that has survived in popular culture. Unlikely as it may seem, these novels provided an early indication &ndash; right from the beginning of the 20th century &ndash; of how well a family saga could work on television. A black and white BBC adaptation of <em>The Forsyte Saga</em> in the 1960s was such a roaring success that 18 million people tuned in to watch the final episode, and it made history as the first BBC series to be sold for official broadcast in the Soviet Union.<br /><br />What all of these family sagas have in common, from the Book of Kings to <em>Succession</em>, is the wealth and power of the family in question. When inheritance is a major theme, it follows that there must be something to inherit, and as a result the overwhelming majority of such stories deal with characters who are rich, privileged and sometimes even royal. There are, of course, deviations. Yaa Gyasi&rsquo;s 2016 novel <em>Homegoing</em> is a family saga that covers the generational fallout from the transatlantic slave trade. Similarly, a recent National Theatre adaptation of several D. H. Lawrence novels, <em>Husbands and Sons</em>, looked at family dynamics and notions of inheritance in a working-class mining community. But these are the exceptions. Even our tastes in non-fictional family sagas tend towards the wealthy and famous, as seen in the way that tabloids delight in the exploits of celebrity offspring or extended family groups.<br /><br />Part of what makes <em>Succession</em> worth watching is that same frisson of reality versus fiction. It&rsquo;s impossible not to notice the parallels between Logan Roy, his media companies and his three warring children and Rupert Murdoch, his media companies and his four children from his first two marriages, all of whom have at one time or another held senior positions in his businesses.</p> <h2>Dysfunctionality on the small screen</h2> <p>The entertainment industry in general and television in particular are very good at latching on to a successful format and replicating it, as different studios and broadcasters attempt to lure viewers&rsquo; attention in an oversaturated market. Thus the popularity of <em>Succession</em> is spawning a renaissance of sorts for the family saga on the small screen. <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em> follows the fortunes of a dysfunctional family of televangelists, and was instantly renewed for a third season. Its tagline &ndash; &ldquo;serving the lord and themselves&rdquo; &ndash; could almost be a motto for this whole subgenre. Then there&rsquo;s <em>Monarch</em>, a multigenerational drama starring Anna Friel and Susan Sarandon, about a country music dynasty called, appropriately enough, the Romans, which promises Roy-style conflict with a different industry as its backdrop.<br /><br />On this side of the Atlantic, this year ITV will air the first series of <em>Riches</em>, which creator Abby Ajayi describes as &ldquo;a love letter to Black London&rdquo;. The six-part series is already attracting comparisons to <em>Succession</em> for its focus on a family of Black Londoners squabbling over their wealthy father&rsquo;s business empire after his health begins to fail. And, of course, the world of TV family sagas is not immune to the industry&rsquo;s obsession with reboots, because this is also the year that HBO&rsquo;s <em>Game of Thrones</em> prequel, <em>House of the Dragon</em>, will debut. In 2022, television is still very much keeping it in the family.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition.</em> <em><span class="Apple-converted-space"><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</span></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This needs to be corrected (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2B17YBWs.jpg" height="836" alt="Two people hugging" width="1175" /></p> <p>As Covid-19 spread across the world in 2020, millions of young people were taken out of school. Referred to as a &ldquo;lost generation&rdquo;, it is often assumed that these children will struggle, if not ultimately fail, to catch up on the days, weeks and months of education they could not access. The anxiety for themselves, their parents and their educators is animated by a fear that they have been damaged already, perhaps irreparably, and that their lives will be blighted forever. <br /><br />But we know from the latest research into child and adolescent development that a young person&rsquo;s ability to catch up should never be considered beyond reach. This doesn&rsquo;t only hold true for education. Across the globe, &ldquo;Catch Up&rdquo; is a technical term applied to a much more fundamental process: the restoration of height, weight and cognition that has been lost as a result of malnutrition. We know from this process that young humans are extraordinarily resilient. With adequate care and support, they have a good chance of regaining what they have lost. It doesn&rsquo;t take much, as long as an essential first ingredient is present: the knowledge that children can recover from setbacks.</p> <h2>The evolving science of nutrition</h2> <p>The science of nutrition is relatively new. The first vitamin, B1, was isolated and chemically defined in 1926. By the 1950s, all the remaining essential micronutrients had been identified and synthesised. It was a transformation in our understanding of malnutrition. Starving children weren&rsquo;t just lacking food, they were missing these minuscule but essential micronutrients. <br /><br />Those of us with the luxury to do so get our iron, iodine and Vitamin A &ndash; the three micronutrients that are vital preventatives of malnutrition &ndash; from the regular food we buy at supermarkets. They enable our bodies to produce enzymes, hormones and other chemicals, and thereby create the messaging system that actually tells our cells to grow or develop or change. It is micronutrients that make us what we will eventually become, but many around the world struggle to access them.<br /><br />The best indication that micronutrients are absent from a child&rsquo;s diet for long periods is stunting (when a child is too short for their age) and wasting (when a child is too thin for their age). A child may feel full from macronutrients (proteins, fats and carbohydrates), but if there are no micronutrients then their cells aren&rsquo;t getting the messages to keep growing towards adulthood. So instead they go into a kind of cellular power conservation survival mode, ready for when the micronutrient going eventually gets better. This process is known as &ldquo;thrifty growth&rdquo;. The child&rsquo;s energy is diverted towards basic survival: keeping their brain and lungs functioning optimally for as long as possible. Less energy, therefore, goes where it should, and their bones stop lengthening as a result. <br /><br />But nothing can be thrifty for ever. Eventually energy runs out, and malnutrition starts to affect a child&rsquo;s cognitive and behavioural development. Malnourished children have less energy to walk to school, and less ability to concentrate when they get there. It is therefore not only once-in-a-lifetime pandemics that keep children out of school; for many children living in conditions of war and famine, myriad factors combine to stop them from accessing education. <br /><br />To date, the easiest way to restore micronutrients is to add them to what are called fortificant food premixes, or to provide them as concentrated supplements in the form of iodised salt, iron tablets and syrups, and Vitamin A capsules. But we are also taking our understanding of the role of micronutrients in new and wonderful directions. Through precise selective breeding, agri-nutritionists have created whole new families of potatoes and sweet potatoes that are &ldquo;nutri-dense&rdquo;, which means they grow with the highest possible pro-Vitamin A and enhanced iron content. <br /><br />These crops aren&rsquo;t only designed to combat malnutrition; they can also help us to meet the challenges of the climate crisis. Ensuring that what we grow has the maximum nutritional value will become increasingly important as the climate changes. This new class of vegetables is drought tolerant and doesn&rsquo;t mind poor soil, which makes them easy to farm in the world&rsquo;s increasingly hot and dry places, where children are already more likely to need micronutrient supplements.</p> <h2>No more thrifty growth</h2> <p>But correcting malnutrition is also a question of timing. Scientists often talk about &ldquo;the first thousand days&rdquo; of a child&rsquo;s life as being the most important for interventions. All micronutrient supplements are best at generating Catch Up when the little human taking them is &ndash; or should be &ndash; undergoing a growth spurt. Supplements should therefore be given in the earliest years of life, when their cells should be fizzing with activity and potential. Across the world, studies show that malnourished children up to the age of three who receive micronutrient supplementation begin to grow again. Perhaps they won&rsquo;t be quite as tall as the international height standard for their region, but nevertheless, they can be put onto the right track. And it means much more than merely taller children with longer legs. It means the messages generated by micronutrients are getting to the right places, stimulating the cell growth and development that are also needed for cognitive development. No more thrift. Children that have fallen behind catch up, both mentally and physically.<br /><br />The &ldquo;thousand days&rdquo; window is extremely important. But we have recently begun to recognise that there is another crucial window of opportunity. Humans have two significant growth spurt periods in their life: one in the first thousand days; the other during adolescence, when puberty occurs. This second growth spurt is every bit as vital to our adult development as the first one. Humans get about 25 per cent of their eventual height during their teenage years, and like those first thousand days, we rely on the chemical messaging of the micronutrient system to get this rapid growth phase in our development done. <br /><br />The need for energy and micronutrients will never be higher than it is in adolescence. This is the point when the micronutrients should be messaging the hormones to tell the brain to develop voluntary-control mechanisms and executive function: the means whereby people get to choose their behaviours, understand their choices, make plans and see them through. If the messages don&rsquo;t get through, it isn&rsquo;t just leg length that is profoundly limited. Cognitive development is every bit as likely as bone length to be stunted and eventually wasted. <br /><br />Adolescents, however, don&rsquo;t receive enough attention, despite the possibilities presented for their Catch Up. In fact, studies from across the world are starting to come in that show that when micronutrient supplementing measures are applied to malnourished adolescents, Catch Up happens much more quickly, significantly and observably than it does in the toddler cohort. Restoring the right amount of nutritious food to teenagers means they do what they are meant to do, and grow to become healthy adults. <br /><br />So why don&rsquo;t we see more programmes and funding directed at teenagers in need, particularly as such interventions are reasonably affordable? It seems that the science is being held back by our prejudices. It&rsquo;s very difficult to fund science on adolescents because society is wary of vaguely threatening young male teenagers living in difficult places where conflict drives their hunger. Their rough skin and narrowed eyes, full of fear and aggression, don&rsquo;t make for good photographs in funding applications. For no good reason, it is often assumed that it&rsquo;s too late to restore what has been lost to these vulnerable young men who are no longer children but have become a frightening, potentially dangerous population. Instead, the round, tear-filled eyes of the hungry toddler, cradled in its mother&rsquo;s arms, gets all the oxygen in the funding room, and most of the money. <br /><br />This is a huge wasted opportunity &ndash; for girls as well as boys. Thus far, everything we know about the potential of adolescent Catch Up comes from studying groups in developed nations: young people who are malnourished for a range of reasons other than conflict or famine, including patients who are congenitally deficient in hormones, who have coeliac disease, or whose bones have been stunted by conditions such as cerebral palsy. Whatever the reason for what is technically termed &ldquo;affluent stunting&rdquo;, micronutrient restoration produces Catch Up in these adolescents, steadily and permanently. <br /><br />It wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to adapt this research to create an infrastructure to enable adolescent Catch Up all over the non-affluent world, and it&rsquo;s likely to result in better fed teenagers who make more thoughtful decisions about the rest of their lives. The Lancet&rsquo;s launch in November of a series on adolescent nutrition, acknowledging that the field is &ldquo;overlooked in policy and investment&rdquo;, is a welcome development, but much more needs to be done. The essential first step, of course, would be accepting that these teenagers are worthy of the effort.</p> <h2>The fundamental value of nurture</h2> <p>There is another major area upon which we could improve, and that is prevention. Everyone agrees that prevention is better than cure. Ending world hunger would be excellent, but in the meantime what can be done to delay the point at which hunger becomes malnutrition and thrift becomes loss? The answer is perhaps unexpected, but even more hopeful than the progress with micronutrient-generated Catch Up. This is because it is something we already do well, across the world and relatively cheaply: we vaccinate. <br /><br />Vaccinations are so very helpful in achieving Catch Up because malnutrition is not just about not enough good food. It also happens because our immune systems, for some evolutionary reason, are not part of the thrifty growth system. When a child&rsquo;s physiology begins to conserve energy, the immune system is immediately diminished, leaving them vulnerable. So the hungry child gets infections everywhere, but especially in the gut, where they cascade catastrophically, starving the child from inside as well as out. <br /><br />This quickly becomes a vicious cycle. Even when micronutrient levels are restored with supplements, the energy that should be resuming growth patterns stays fighting the effects of infection. The result: no Catch Up, just a slow diversion of resources into a cycle of hunger and sickness. In a vaccinated child, however, the chemical messages aren&rsquo;t wasted fighting infections, but go where they are needed to generate positive growth and development.<br /><br />Not only do vaccinations help break the malnutrition-immune dysfunction cycle, they also fill in the immunity gap. This is because vaccinations can generate what are technically called &ldquo;beneficial non-specific effects&rdquo;. It means that a BCG shot, for instance, given against TB or leprosy, also strengthens the whole immune response in each child that receives it, and therefore gives better overall resistance to disease. Another example is the measles vaccine, which gives the same fortificant power to the overall developing immune system, as well as no more measles. <br /><br />Not all vaccinations have this ability. The pneumonia vaccine, for example, simply does what it says on the vial. And the BCG vaccination has to be given as early in the first thousand days as possible in order to achieve its best effects. If it&rsquo;s done right, a vaccinated child has higher haemoglobin levels than an unvaccinated child and is therefore less likely to need iron supplements. This is because vaccinations have ensured that at least one of its micronutrients is doing just fine, getting the important messages to wherever in the body they are needed.<br /><br />We don&rsquo;t yet know if something similar happens with teenage vaccinations. But that&rsquo;s only because we haven&rsquo;t looked yet.</p> <p>One more thing. When a child is taken for their vaccination, we can see a process at work that is as fundamental to achieving proper nutrition in its widest possible sense as feeding is. A vaccinated child is a nurtured child. If the child is held and comforted during the process, their tears wiped away and their paper record card carefully kept until next time, then they are receiving nurturing care. Nurturing generates cognitive stimulation, just as micronutrients do. <br /><br />A child that isn&rsquo;t nurtured isn&rsquo;t only less likely to be vaccinated. If no one reads them a story at a regular bedtime or ensures they are warm, comfortable and able to dream their way through untroubled nights, then they may never be able to read a story all the way to the end for themselves. Even if they can walk to school they won&rsquo;t be able to do much when they get there. <br /><br />This holds for teenagers too. If no one listens to the aspirations of an adolescent, and if they aren&rsquo;t encouraged to stay in school for as long as possible, then even if their bellies are full they too will be held back and eventually fall behind. Literacy is as a good marker as vaccination status as to whether or not a child or adolescent is receiving the essential ingredients of nurturing.</p> <h2>Healthcare by other means</h2> <p>Yet for all the work being done to increase vaccinations, and despite a 70 per cent drop worldwide in vaccine-preventable deaths since 2000, there are reckoned to be 20 million children who are under-vaccinated, which means they may have received no or only some of their vaccinations. It&rsquo;s not because of funding shortages. Vaccines are efficient and inexpensive, and vaccinators are never short on energy and courage. But vaccinations stall in particular regions in the world because of political instability, poor communications and community dysfunction &ndash; for all sorts of reasons that don&rsquo;t need more science for resolution, just better human activity and wider peace. In the meantime, the gap remains.<br /><br />A good place to start bridging the gap would be through the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the UN for realisation in 2030. We should make a new goal, specifically aimed at optimising current vaccination strategy systems so that every young person may have an optimised immune system. That is a good place to start, because vaccinations are healthcare systems by other means, easy and cheap to establish. This new SDG could probably be brought in ahead of schedule because it only needs a bit more science, some improved communications and logistics and &ndash; perhaps the most significant challenge of all &ndash; for us to set aside our prejudices about who is deserving of our care and attention, of our best and most expensive research efforts. If we have two chances per human to optimise immune systems and therefore generate Catch Up, then we should take them both, and let no one fall behind. <br /><br />There are no lost generations, just the ones we prefer not to see. Catch Up, wherever you look for it, depends on human beings doing things we already know how to do, and doing them as well as they can possibly be done for every single child and adolescent who needs them. Young people themselves &ndash; with their remarkable resilience and ability to survive &ndash; will do most of the rest, given just a little of the right support.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

How can our civilisation&rsquo;s greatest challenge be rendered in a digestible form that doesn&rsquo;t utterly depress its readers but rather compels them past the first chapter? Enter two new works by Simon Mundy and Mya-Rose Craig. Both refuse to get bogged down in either dystopian futures or endless statistics, choosing instead to focus on the stories of people across the world whose daily experiences of environmental change, along with their efforts to tackle it, can help us to make sense of this mind-boggling situation.<br /><br />Over the last 15 years as an environmental campaigner, I&rsquo;ve seen the different ways we&rsquo;ve tried, and often failed, to convey the magnitude of the problem. We&rsquo;ve taken turns focusing on economic cost, lives lost, or worsening manifestations like the recent floods and droughts. We tried sneaking climate more indirectly into communications around issues like fuel poverty and air pollution. Now, thankfully, it feels as though we are finally putting the emergency back where it needs to be: front and centre. <br /><br /><em>Race for Tomorrow</em> and <em>We Have a Dream </em>are part of this trend, which recognises that there is no one single answer to the catastrophe. To write a book about what Mundy describes as &ldquo;by far the biggest story of the century&rdquo;, to &ldquo;avoid getting lost in the sprawling mass of information, with a subject that touches every part of the planet&rdquo;, both authors have opted to highlight multiple narratives from across the world. Craig&rsquo;s <em>We Have a Dream</em>, written primarily for young people to inspire them into action, focuses on raising up the voices of young Indigenous people and people of colour. Mundy, who writes for those taking their first foray into the complexity of the issue, journeys across the world interviewing fascinating people playing very different roles in the fight against climate change. <br /><br />Adapting to our new reality is a feature of any book now being written about climate change. But as Mundy says when visiting Venice to report on its new ocean barrier developed to protect the city from rising seas, &ldquo;the barrier is less a promise of a new future than a gigantic symbol of all that has gone wrong in the past&rdquo;. He recalls the climate scientists arriving on Maldivian atolls to chart when a village will disappear, not if. <br /><br />In <em>We Have a Dream</em>, young activist Litokne Kabua tells us how nearly two thirds of the homes in his Marshall Islands community have washed away after extreme weather events and the degradation of coral reefs that protect the islands from storm waves. Adaptation alone will never be enough to safeguard the most vulnerable, who have had no hand in creating this mess &ndash; and both books thankfully still choose mitigation of climate change&rsquo;s worst impacts as their focus.</p> <h2>Lawyers and activists vs. the fossil fuel companies</h2> <p>I am always pleasantly surprised when reading books about the environment to come across a statistic that grabs my attention, and Mundy doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. I had to put the book down and take a deep breath after learning that mountain glaciers are retreating by 10,000 tonnes per second. Woven into his journey are a number of such facts, before he moves on to another story from an entirely different perspective. It is a pace that occasionally risks sacrificing complexity. Yet on the whole he captures many of the trade-offs, conflicts and double standards at play in the fight for climate action. <br /><br />The chapter on Bangladesh manages this especially well. It explores the conflict between Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s much lauded climate rhetoric on the world stage and her despotism at home. The culprits of this crisis, however, enter a little late. Fossil fuel companies make their first appearance about halfway through the book, via the incredible story of the Filipino lawyers and activists challenging Shell. Yet their role is intrinsic to every single story Mundy tells. Similarly, we have to wait until the final section for the entry of the US and China, despite their fundamental role in destroying the environment and in developing the climate adaptation infrastructure he visits across the globe. But if the villains take a while to appear, the rallying call of those fighting them features throughout &ndash; and there is no equivocation about the need for climate justice.<br /><br />The increasingly popular call for rich countries to take responsibility forces us to confront the reality that, just as climate change is linked to other planetary tipping points, such as biodiversity loss, it also cannot be isolated from systemic injustices and global inequalities. The very premise of Craig&rsquo;s book highlights this fact, choosing only activists who, like the author, are people of colour and/or who represent Indigenous communities. Unsurprisingly for a book with intersectionality at its heart, its focus is rarely exclusively on climate: addressing rights for Indigenous communities living through frighteningly rapid change in the Arctic, efforts to conserve wildlife in Bangladesh, and the challenges of air pollution in Singapore. <br /><br />The stories in <em>We Have a Dream</em> implicitly remind us that climate change is a threat multiplier: it makes other problems worse, and by what magnitude is very hard to predict. What we know is that inequality, conflict and resulting mass migration can be worsened by climate change, while some environmental threats, like interference with the nitrogen cycle, can also compound it. As an inspiring activist herself (I worked with Craig when one of Greenpeace&rsquo;s ships took her to the Arctic for the most northerly ever climate strike), she streamlines the information most likely to spur action in her readers. The stories she promotes &ndash; each accompanied by vibrant, beautiful illustrations by Sabrena Khadija &ndash; follow the same format. We are introduced to 30 inspiring individuals: their backstories, dreams for the future, and the moment they first realised environmental activism was for them. For a younger reader, the book might well prove transformative. <br /><br />As primers for quite different audiences, neither work attempts to be exhaustive in its scope. With climate change, such a task is virtually impossible. Instead, I was left at the end of each book wanting more, and therein lies their success. In fact, it would be hard to finish either as a newcomer to the subject, or to climate activism, and not immediately go out to try and learn more. And that is exactly what these authors want to happen.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

There is a big difference between researching something and developing a practical weapon.<br /><br /><strong>What therefore do you make of US claims that these &ldquo;attacks&rdquo; have produced, among others, brain damage?<br /><br /></strong><strong>Robert Bartholomew:</strong> The claims of brain damage, changes to white matter [nerve fibres found in the deep tissue of the brain] and hearing loss are the product of inaccurate reporting. In December 2017, information was leaked to the media about a study that was being conducted on US Embassy patients which showed mysterious white matter tract changes in their brains. Media outlets around the world reported on the strange &ldquo;brain anomalies&rdquo;. Then, in February 2018, the study appeared in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>. Yet only three of the patients exhibited white matter tract changes, which is the same distribution you would expect to find in a normal population because white matter changes are common in everything from depression to migraines to normal ageing.<br /><br />Then there were the reports of brain damage after the publication of a 2019 study in the same journal. Again, the story made headlines, with many media outlets reporting on the &ldquo;brain damage&rdquo; suffered by the diplomats. However, brain anomalies are not the same as brain damage. While they did find anomalies, it is not unusual to find minor anomalies in small patient cohorts due to individual variation, given they can be caused by exposure to long-term stress.<br /><br />As for reports of hearing loss, that never happened either. In 2018, the results of a study on US diplomats who were reportedly suffering from Havana Syndrome were leaked. The media was soon reporting that one-third of the patients in the study were experiencing hearing loss. However, when the study was published that December, only two patients had hearing loss, and in both cases, it had occurred <em>before</em> they were even posted to Cuba. The remainder thought they had hearing loss, but when given a standard hearing test, it proved to be unfounded.<br /><br /><strong>The head of one US association that represents current and former diplomats and foreign aid workers recently stated that victims have suffered &ldquo;real trauma and real injury&rdquo;. If it were indeed psychological, how could the consequences be so severe? <br /><br /></strong><strong>Robert Bartholomew: </strong>Mass psychogenic illness symptoms are as real as any other medical condition, but their origin is non-organic. It is not just &ldquo;all in their heads&rdquo;. They are experiencing real symptoms and both Professor Baloh and I are sympathetic to their suffering. But telling them they have brain damage only exacerbates their condition.<br /><br /><strong>Robert Baloh</strong>: The key difference is that there is no evidence of brain injury or brain damage. MRI scans of the brain have been normal and there are no neurological abnormalities on examination. The non-specific test abnormalities that have been reported are commonly seen in patients with stress-related neurological disorders such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.<br /><br /><strong>There have now been some 1,000 cases of Havana Syndrome reported worldwide. How is it able to spread across geographies in the way it has? <br /><br /></strong><strong>Robert Baloh</strong>: In fact this is strong support for a diagnosis of psychogenic illness. Diplomatic and state department officials were warned to be on the outlook for symptoms and to immediately report them. This caused them to focus and ruminate on routine body symptoms that nearly everyone experiences. They developed negative expectations, called the &ldquo;nocebo effect&rdquo;, and by attending to the symptoms, the symptoms were amplified and required less activation for conscious awareness.<br /><br /><strong>Robert Bartholomew:</strong> Like all outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness, you need to understand the context. You need to go back to patient zero. It began in a small unit of CIA officers in Havana in late 2016. For weeks they had been hearing mysterious sounds &ndash; then one day one of them presented to the US Embassy clinic with a headache and ear pain, and a theory emerged that they were being harassed by a new acoustical weapon. The story then spread through the small CIA unit, and not long after, to the US and Canadian embassies which had a close relationship and were sharing information. The sonic attack hypothesis may seem like an odd assumption at first, but you have to put yourself in their shoes. The notion that they were harassed seemed plausible because there is a long history of Cuban agents harassing diplomats. For instance, during the Cold War, agents would sneak into their houses while they slept and rearrange furniture, leave cigarette butts on their kitchen table and open all the windows so the house would become filled with mosquitos. The diplomats who were sent to the new Embassy in Havana in 2015 had been briefed on this.<br /><br />However, there&rsquo;s an old saying: &ldquo;When you hear the sounds of hoofbeats in the night, first think horses not zebras.&rdquo; The doctors in the US State Department went for the most exotic hypothesis early on &ndash; they were searching for unicorns when they should have stuck to more mundane explanations. Of the first 21 victims in Cuba, eight recorded their &ldquo;attacks&rdquo;, and a panel of scientists later concluded that the sounds aligned closely with the mating call of the Indies short-tailed cricket [an insect local to Cuba]!<br /><br /><strong>One alleged cause of &ldquo;Havana Syndrome&rdquo; &ndash; sound waves &ndash; has been seen before in instances of mass psychogenic illness. Can you explain the brief life of &ldquo;acoustic shock&rdquo; in the early days of telephones? <br /><br /></strong><strong>Robert Baloh:</strong> Acoustic shock, which is discussed in detail in our book, has many parallels with Havana Syndrome. In the early days of telephones, people developed a wide spectrum of symptoms including headache, dizziness, tinnitus and brain fog after hearing a brief disturbing sound on a telephone. Typically, the sound, if recorded, was not that impressive. The condition was initially called an &ldquo;ear concussion&rdquo; even though there was no evidence of ear damage.<br /><br /><strong>History is littered with stories of such mass hysterias: the dancing manias of the Middle Ages; the laughter epidemic in Tanzania in 1962; mass fainting at a school in Blackburn, England in 1965. What makes us susceptible to them? <br /><br /></strong><strong>Robert Bartholomew:</strong> In a word: plausibility. There is an old saying: &ldquo;Talk of the devil and he is bound to appear.&rdquo; In Salem in 1692, a belief in the devil altered the perceptual sets of the local residents whose worldview included the reality of witches and demons. In Salem, when the cry of &ldquo;Witch!&rdquo; went up, believers went searching for evidence to confirm it. If someone visited and you fell sick soon after, it was evidence of witchcraft. It&rsquo;s not that dissimilar to Havana Syndrome because many of the symptoms are so vague as to be experienced by nearly everyone on the planet in any given week: fatigue, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, insomnia, dizziness, confusion, disorientation, ear pressure and pain.<br /><br /><strong>Robert Baloh:</strong> Although the human brain is a remarkable organ, it has &ldquo;design flaws&rdquo; that make it vulnerable to suggestion and manipulation. Advertisers and politicians routinely take advantage of these flaws to influence our behaviour with regards to purchases and voting. These design flaws can be traced to both nature and nurture. Many of our emotions and behaviours are ingrained in the primitive deep brain modules encoded by genes that evolved over millions of years of evolution. We are susceptible to irrational fears that can change the chemistry and physiology of our brain and body, leading to a wide range of symptoms.<br /><br /><strong>US government officials don&rsquo;t exactly fit the typical profile of victims of mass hysteria, who are often either young or not informed by western science and medicine. What conditions in their line of work might have produced it? <br /><br /></strong><strong>Robert Baloh: </strong>First, these are common misperceptions about victims of mass psychogenic illness, in part due to &ldquo;historical baggage&rdquo; associated with the word &ldquo;hysteria&rdquo;. Mass psychogenic illness can affect anyone regardless of age, gender or level of education. It often begins in close-knit groups living in stressful situations and is amplified by politics and cultural beliefs.<br /><br /><strong>Robert Bartholomew:</strong> We do not claim that victims of psychogenic illness are &ldquo;crazy&rdquo;, mentally ill or are psychologically weak. It is a collective stress response that is based on a belief. We all have beliefs, and therefore everyone is potentially susceptible. That includes highly trained and well-educated intelligence officers.<br /><br />While CIA agents appear to have been over-represented as victims, that is readily explainable. In Havana, intelligence agents were viewed as the first targets and intelligence officers around the world were warned that they might be next, thus resulting in agents being hyperaware of their health and creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is important to remember that not every victim is experiencing mass psychogenic illness. Many are simply redefining an array of common and uncommon health conditions under a new label: &ldquo;Havana Syndrome&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>Why might the US government be so resistant to accepting that this could be the work of something other than a hostile state? <br /><br /></strong><strong>Robert Bartholomew:</strong> I believe that embarrassment is a big factor. It is embarrassing to think that they have spent five years chasing ghosts, and in the process, wasted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating claims of an imaginary secret weapon that turned out to be the mating calls of crickets.<br /><br /><strong>Robert Baloh: </strong>They have also backed themselves into a corner, having strongly supported the notion of an attack by a hostile state from the very onset. Some politicians have demanded retaliation even though we have no idea who to retaliate against. Other politicians have specifically used the foreign attack theory to further their agenda against Cuba. Furthermore, &ldquo;victims&rsquo; groups&rdquo; have powerful political allies and they refuse to even consider the possibility of psychogenic illness. Even mentioning the term can lead to immediate sanctioning.<br /><br /><strong>There are a range of potentially serious outcomes &ndash; both political and scientific &ndash; that arise from this. In what ways could it prove consequential beyond just being a matter of intrigue? <br /><br /></strong><strong>Robert Baloh: </strong>Obvious political consequences are the breakdown in relations with Cuba and possible future actions against other countries despite the lack of evidence of an &ldquo;attack&rdquo;. With regards to the &ldquo;victims&rdquo; of the proposed attacks, telling them that they have brain damage caused by some type of mysterious weapon is a prescription for a life with chronic debilitating symptoms. Their symptoms are real but they need to be reassured that they do not have permanent brain damage and that they can be treated and get well.<br /><br /><strong>Robert Bartholomew:</strong> The real danger that this case poses is to highlight the potential for politics to become mixed with science. The implications are enormous, from vaccination uptake to global warming. The effectiveness of vaccines and the reality of global warming are settled science, but in the social media and fake news age, misinformation abounds.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
