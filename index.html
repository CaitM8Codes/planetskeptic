<p>Your destination is the university (and specifically, my lab) on the right side of the map. You will enter from the left, or west side, either from town or my house, the blue marker. There are three main entrances: 4th Avenue, on the top, which is a bit round about and only has a pedestrian walkway to the north, and also skirts the perilous cemetery; 2nd Avenue, south, which is really only for vehicular traffic and mainly gives you access to glamorous parking lots; and 3rd Avenue, the middle and most direct route. It&#8217;s difficult and dangerous to detour to 2nd or 4th from 3rd Avenue, since there are no sidewalks along College, and the roads are currently packed ice, inhabited by wandering bands of student cars.</p>
<p>Conveniently, there is a footpath from 3rd &#038; College, my starting point, directly to the Science Building. Excellent! Unfortunately, it slopes gently downward, and when we get any snowmelt at all, followed by a freeze, it turns into the Slalom of Death. We&#8217;re going to get a brief thaw today, followed by a plummet once again into bitter cold. I may die tomorrow.</p>
<p>That same path becomes more navigable in the summer, but it is surrounded on both sides by leafy ground cover and lots of trees, and is inhabited by clouds of blood-sucking monsters in the summer, the Tunnel of Blood. The stirges hibernate in the winter, at least.</p>
<p>Roll for initiative. Choose your path. &#8216;Ware wandering monsters. I hear there are bugbears and slime beasts in the administration building off map, to the right, so don&#8217;t get clever and think you can just go around.</p>
<p>There is a dungeon in the science building. Also a book store where you can replenish your supplies of t-shirts, pens, and candy bars (not much in the way of books, though).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2CAATC3.jpg" height="787" alt="Marcelo Bielsa" width="1181" /></p> <p class="p1">Soon after taking over in 1961, Leeds United manager Don Revie became obsessed with the idea that his football ground was haunted. The club wasn&rsquo;t reaching its potential, while the players kept on choking when it really mattered. Revie invited a medium to &ldquo;cleanse&rdquo; the space of evil spirits.</p> <p class="p3">For a while, it seemed to have worked. By the end of the 1963-64 season, Leeds had been promoted to the First Division (now the Premier League). But, in keeping with previous years, they missed out on the title by goal difference, finishing second. Revie became convinced that a curse had been placed on the club.</p> <p class="p3">One might pass Revie&rsquo;s actions off as the work of a paranoid mind. Yet they fit squarely within a longstanding tradition of football being elevated to the level of the spiritual. We might even go so far as to say that football is an opium of the people.</p> <p class="p3">A hundred years ago, the pioneering sociologist Emile Durkheim argued that religion emerged through communal living, while the earliest faiths were based not on cosmogonies, but the worship of sacred symbols, or &ldquo;totems&rdquo;, that expressed the values of a tribe itself. Tribesmen wore their coats of arms about their body, much like football fans today wear shirts, face paint and badges bearing their club&rsquo;s logos and colours. And like the single community that constitutes a church, football stadiums and other such venues offer physical locations where abstract values can be embodied through ceremony, ritual and symbolism.</p> <p class="p3">According to Durkheim, early social rituals were an &ldquo;eminently collective thing&rdquo;. The devotee confused the effervescent feeling of a social life greater than him or herself with an experience of divinity. The most obvious manifestation of this in football is the tendency among fans to see players as figures to worship &ndash; saints, if not gods. After all, Diego Maradona even has a religion founded in his name:<em> Iglesia Maradoniana</em>, or the Church of Maradona.</p> <p class="p3">But if, among devoted fans, football clubs are churches, then what does that make their managers? The recent tumultuous history of Leeds United shows us how the way in which clubs are run &ndash; making use of myth and ritual &ndash; can impact and transform the psyches of players and fans, for better or for worse.</p> <h2 class="p3">Don Revie and the cult of money</h2> <p class="p3">Don Revie, as we&rsquo;ve seen, was a deeply superstitious man. The medium was only the beginning. During the course of his leadership from 1961 to 1974, he invited a fortune teller to urinate on the four corners of the pitch, and scrapped the club&rsquo;s nickname of the &ldquo;Peacocks&rdquo; and the owl on its badge out of a fear of feathered creatures. His actions revealed the mindset of an insecure and determined manager, but there was something much deeper at work in his turn to the irrational.</p> <p class="p3">Revie knew that the fortunes of Leeds United were central to the city&rsquo;s concept of itself. As Anthony Clavane describes in his cultural history of the club, <em>Promised Land: A Northern Love Story,</em> Leeds players aligned themselves with the concerns of upwardly mobile, inwardly anxious northern men, just like Don Revie himself, who could never quite reconcile where he came from with who he wanted to be.</p> <p class="p3">His Leeds came to be reviled as nasty cheaters, intent on winning whatever the method. Don Revie&rsquo;s had become a blind faith in money and success at all costs, a creed that seemed to infect the club. By the new millennium, Leeds United was engaging in a reckless spending spree which took them to the heights of footballing Europe, matching the city&rsquo;s swagger as a regenerated financial centre and &ldquo;Knightsbridge of the North&rdquo;. But the owners and players had banked on the club attaining regular Champions League football to fund their lavish new lifestyle. They didn&rsquo;t.</p> <p class="p3">The club imploded spectacularly. They sold their best players, got relegated, went into administration, got relegated again, and spent 15 years in the wilderness, a kind of Ozymandias. The biggest one-city club in Europe lay wrecked in the desert of the third tier of English football, its cracked visage standing as a warning of the hubris of living beyond your means.</p> <p class="p3">I asked Clavane about the club&rsquo;s history and how it feeds into the idea of sport-as-religion. He described Leeds, both city and club, as perennial underachievers longing for salvation. By 2018, he told me, &ldquo;Leeds needed an outsider to come in and turn [its] world &ndash; the club&rsquo;s and city&rsquo;s &ndash; upside down.&rdquo; And that is exactly what happened: <em>call and he will answer</em>.</p> <h2 class="p3">Believing in the team</h2> <p class="p4">Walk the streets of Leeds today and you will see murals of a man who has eschewed the trappings of his wealth, who turned down residence in a luxury hotel in favour of living in a one-bedroom flat, who appeared at exclusive black-tie dinners wearing a tracksuit, and who once bought a car as a prize for the staff Christmas raffle. You may have heard him called many names: El Loco, The Professor, The Bucket Man. To Leeds United fans, Marcelo Bielsa is simply known as God.</p> <p class="p3">An Argentinian, Bielsa transformed the club and brought a new source of pride to the city. He did so, in part, by applying a new set of beliefs to Leeds United. Where the religion of the market would dictate that players should have been sold and &ldquo;better&rdquo; products bought, Bielsa kept nearly all of those from the season prior to his arrival. While past managers had put their trust in money, El Loco (&ldquo;The Crazy One&rdquo;) appeared to have faith in his players, in their capacity not just to make mistakes but to make amends, to learn, to improve.</p> <p class="p3">On the first game of the 2018-19 season, Leeds emerged <em>sui generis</em> to blow away Stoke City &ndash; favourites to be promoted to the Premier League &ndash; with a brand of free-flowing, high-pressing, life-affirming football that would become the hallmark of Bielsa&rsquo;s Leeds. In 2020, when they marched back to the Premier League, players long seen as write-offs quickly corrected their critics. Patrick Bamford became the second highest scoring Englishman behind Harry Kane, while Kalvin Phillips went from a squad player to playing every game of England&rsquo;s march to the Euro 2020 final, hailed by former England manager Fabio Capello as the &ldquo;best modern midfielder&rdquo; in the world.</p> <p class="p3">Like Don Revie before him, Bielsa made use of those same tools of myth, ritual and religion. Like Revie, he had his eccentricities: the blue line he had painted between his flat and the training ground so he could focus his mind on football rather than navigation; the insane levels of preparation, which included the 19 hours he spent analysing footage of a single youth team prospect, as well as managing the under-12s during the off season and producing an eight-page dossier on a third-choice goalkeeper.</p> <p class="p3">But the principles behind Bielsa&rsquo;s managerial style came from a very particular place. A devout Catholic, while manager of Athletic Bilbao in Spain he took a trip to the St Clare Convent in Guernica. There, he prayed with the &ldquo;Poor Clares&rdquo;, an austere and ascetic order of nuns within the Roman Catholic Church that are devoted to prayer, penance, contemplation and manual work. He was so struck by his brief time at the convent that in a subsequent game he placed a sign emblazoned with &ldquo;Poor Clares&rdquo; near the manager&rsquo;s dugout, before a stadium official had it removed.</p> <p class="p3">In fact, &ldquo;Bielsaball&rdquo;, the name fans gave the manager&rsquo;s underlying style and approach, seemed very much like a secularised version of liberation theology. This Catholic movement, founded in Latin America in the 1960s, saw the church as duty-bound to help the poor and bring about the potential of all through liberation from oppression. The dignity of every human, the importance of family, community and participation, of rights and responsibilities &ndash; these values have found modern-day expression in the spirit of team sports and in Leeds United.</p> <h2 class="p3">Goodbye to a secular saint</h2> <p class="p4">But does this impulse have to be thought of as religious? We could also view Bielsa&rsquo;s attitude as rooted in a humanistic belief in people as ends in and of themselves. It is not a coincidence that the people of Leeds share something of the values of two clubs that are similarly close to Bielsa&rsquo;s heart: Athletic Bilbao and Newell&rsquo;s Old Boys, whom he managed early on in his career. Like Leeds, their core support base hails from post-industrial towns where passion and hard work, and the will to self-improvement, are as central to life in the workplace as they are in the football stands.</p> <p class="p3">As clubs around the world move toward private equity ownership and new markets, it is the identification fans have with their clubs &ndash; essentially human passions expressed through ritual and the possibility of competition &ndash; that is most at risk. On the eve of the planned departure of the Big Six clubs from the Premier League to the Super League in April 2021 &ndash; a move which placed the profit motive at the heart of the sport &ndash; Bielsa grew reflective. &ldquo;One of the reasons football is the most popular sport in the world is because the weak can beat the powerful,&rdquo; he said. And he turned out to be right. Backlash from supposedly &ldquo;disempowered&rdquo; fans led the plans for the Super League to be shelved.</p> <p class="p3">It took an outsider, an eccentric, a man with the cult following of a secular saint, to unleash the potential of Leeds United and reveal the talent that was there all along. Bielsa is no longer manager of Leeds United. But we can still learn from El Loco and his &ldquo;mad belief&rdquo; that football&rsquo;s value lies not in rapacious capitalism or winning-at-all-costs, but in working-class communities, the bonds between human beings, and the faith placed in their inherent capacity for improvement. It may not be such a crazy idea after all.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<div class="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mMq9QGhpGI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Rebecca is looking at a <a href="https://skepchick.org/2022/02/why-those-who-understand-evolution-are-less-likely-to-be-bigots/">study that found</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>“…low belief in human evolution was associated with higher levels of prejudice, racist attitudes, and support for discriminatory behaviors against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ), Blacks, and immigrants in the United States (Study 1), with higher ingroup biases, prejudicial attitudes toward outgroups, and less support for conflict resolution in samples collected from 19 Eastern European countries (Study 2), 25 Muslim countries (Study 3), and Israel (Study 4). Further, among Americans, lower belief in evolution was associated with greater prejudice and militaristic attitudes toward political outgroups (Study 5).”</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s an observation that accords well with what I&#8217;ve seen, anecdotally. My most religious family members are also the most racist…or is it that my most racist relatives are the most religious? I don&#8217;t really know which direction the arrow of causality is facing.</p>
<p>But also, as someone who has associated more with atheists than theists, we all know that the atheist movement split over precisely this kind of issue. There are lots of self-declared evolutionists who also rail against immigration, who claim that there are differences in intelligence that split along racial lines, and who are confident that women are inferior to men. I&#8217;m looking at the study and thinking that maybe this result is an artifact of the godless being swamped out by the numbers of the godly.</p>
<p>But then, they controlled for religion.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Finally, perceived similarity to animals (a construct distinct from belief in evolution, Study 6) partially mediated the link between belief in evolution and prejudice (Studies 7 and 8), even when controlling for religious beliefs, political views, and other demographic variables, and were also observed for nondominant groups (i.e., religious and racial minorities). ”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that&#8217;s more believable, and narrows the cause of the effect significantly. It&#8217;s not just religion, it&#8217;s having beliefs that encourage categorizing some living things as meaningless and subject to murder. That&#8217;s a metric that clearly suggests that the most egalitarian and benevolent people are those who even love spiders. (OK, respecting the right to life for fruit flies might be even better, but I haven&#8217;t been able to bring myself to that level of enlightenment yet.)</p>
<p>Now I want to see a comparison of NRA members to the general public. People who buy great big guns so they can slaughter large warmbloods might be the worst of them all.</p>

<p class="lead">It&#8217;s easy, right? You could write it in BASIC and run it off the old Apple II in your closet. You just accept a text string from someone calling in, and you post it on a web page, and presto! Fame and money start rolling in.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/trumps-truth-social-rollout-has-been-as-glitchy-as-youd-expect/">Donald Trump could do it</a>! Or <em>think</em> he could do it, because that man is delusional.</p>
<blockquote><p>The rollout of Donald Trump&#8217;s social network has predictably been a disaster. Truth Social&#8217;s debut on Monday was marred by technical problems and a gigantic waiting list, while some people who actually were able to use the service complained of being &#8220;censored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truth Social &#8220;has been almost entirely inaccessible in the first days of its grand debut because of technical glitches, a 13-hour outage and a 300,000-person waitlist,&#8221; The Washington Post wrote yesterday. Trump Media &#038; Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes said on a Fox News show that Truth Social&#8217;s goal is to be &#8220;fully operational at least within the United States&#8221; by the end of March. The waiting list is now over 500,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how many of those half million are lookie-loos gawking at the train wreck, how many are reporters who figure they just have to report on this desperate ex-politician&#8217;s fantasy (they don&#8217;t, by the way), and how many are sincere followers of Trump AKA chucklefucks?</p>
<p>Of course he didn&#8217;t design this himself.</p>
<blockquote><p>Truth Social was built using Mastodon open source software.</p></blockquote>
<p>They just grabbed some existing software, plastered some graphics and revised some of the text messages, and called it good.</p>
<p>I have an <a href="https://octodon.social/@pzmyers">account on Mastodon</a>. I didn&#8217;t have to wait in line to get it, just found an instance that didn&#8217;t have the Donald on it, and started typing. Isn&#8217;t the point of Mastodon to have a decentralized distribution of servers, anyway?</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s a bit ironic to name the failing media site created by a politician known for constantly lying &#8220;truth&#8221;.</p>

This was the culmination of a century of phenomenal genetic discovery: the identification of chromosomes in 1882; the discovery of the structure of DNA in the 1950s; and finally the publication of the 3 billion letters that make up our genetic code.</p> <p>Profound advancements in genetics have continued into this century. A single genome can now be sequenced in just days for less than $1000. Low-cost sequencing has sped up the growth of genetic data, which has progressed our understanding of the traits that make us human and that confer susceptibility to disease. Yet despite such advances, the vast majority of our genome remains relatively unexplored.</p> <p>Much focus to date has been on the minority of our genome that encodes proteins. This has been driven in part by biological logic, but also by data availability and cost. Research into the function of the remaining 97 per cent of &ldquo;non-coding&rdquo; regions (until recently often dubbed &ldquo;junk&rdquo;) has been limited. However, there is now abundant evidence that genetic variation outside of coding regions is a critical aspect of our biology. Much of this type of DNA is thought to control which genes are turned on or off &ndash; a mechanism already known to be important in a number of diseases, including Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p> <p>In November 2021 the UK Biobank (UKBB) project released 200,000 whole human genomes from largely healthy participants: the single biggest human genome dataset to date. Scientists hope that this dataset will enhance understanding of the function and impact of the non-coding genome on human health and disease, as well as improving drug discovery and development. But it holds further value: participants in the project have given broad consent to the use of their genomes such that a swathe of future research possibilities now opens up.</p> <p>The release of the 200,000 genomes last year will be followed by a further 300,000 in 2023. It&rsquo;s a boon for scientific progress, and a relative steal: the whole project cost &pound;200 million, far cheaper than the $1 billion it cost to sequence a single genome in 2001.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of our New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Released in 1972, Pong, which crudely approximates table tennis, was among the first video games created, and the early arcade machines it featured on now stand proudly in museums across the US. <br /><br />The game didn&rsquo;t require a huge amount of brain power, though it did need some: the capacity to predict where the opponent would send the ball; the ability to move the &ldquo;paddle&rdquo; to meet the ball in advance of its arrival. But it evidently didn&rsquo;t demand too much of the human body beyond that, as scientists at Cortical Labs in Australia have now proven.<br /><br />They have taught human brain cells in a petri dish to do more or less what kids did half a century ago, only this time the cells are playing against themselves, bouncing the ball against a virtual wall. Still, they need to operate the paddle and predict the ball&rsquo;s trajectory. <br /><br />The roughly 800,000 cells in the petri dish were sent electrical pulses via microelectrodes: if the ball is arriving at their left side, the signal goes to the left-hand side of the mass, and the same for the right-hand side. The white bar accordingly moves to meet the ball. Cortical Labs&rsquo; Brett Kagan told <em>New Scientist</em> magazine that the teaching of these &ldquo;cyborg mini-brains&rdquo;, as the team calls them, took only five minutes. <br /><br />The experiment will likely add to growing belief in the power &ndash; and scientific utility &ndash; of synthetic brains. In August last year, Science journal published a report on work done by researchers in France to create a computer simulation of the way in which neurons send information between different parts of the brain, and which could be observed mimicking the process of memory formation. A team at King&rsquo;s College London meanwhile used a combination of AI and the Cambridge-1 supercomputer, the UK&rsquo;s most powerful computer, to generate synthetic brain images that enable them to observe how certain illnesses or ageing-related processes trigger changes in the brain over time &ndash; all without needing to place actual humans in an MRI tunnel. <br /><br />The prospect of cyborg brains might not sit too easily. After all, Hollywood has long been telling us that if the machines rise up, humanity will fall. But there is growing scientific support for the furthering of this kind of research, not least because it will make obsolete the invasive procedures currently required to study our brains.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist spring 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

These eight-legged micro-organisms &ndash; also called water bears &ndash; are extremophiles, meaning that while they might live in a mossy corner of your garden, they can also survive in extremely hostile climes: temperatures ranging from near absolute zero to well over 100C and pressures found in the deepest ocean.<br /><br />This makes them well suited to space, particularly given their high tolerance for cosmic radiation. Chances are that tardigrades are currently living on the moon, deposited there by an Israeli spacecraft as part of a &ldquo;lunar library&rdquo; back in 2019 (see Kit Chapman on page 18). That&rsquo;s not to say that they&rsquo;re crawling around. Instead, they will have entered a form of suspended animation, adopting a dehydrated spore-like state. But should anyone administer a drop of reviving water, they could well spring back to life.<br /><br />Tardigrades have a raft of strange biological adaptations, which we&rsquo;re only beginning to understand. They contain a unique DNA damage suppressor protein that protects their genetic material from the radicals formed when high energy ionising radiation interacts with water. They also contain an unusual amount of intrinsically disordered proteins. (Most proteins, in contrast, adopt a fixed 3D shape.) <br /><br />Recently, Martin Blackledge and his team at the Institute of Structural Biology in France may have discovered a reason why they produce quite so much disordered protein. When one of these proteins was cooled or dehydrated, it formed a fibrous gel. Intriguingly, this gel protected other, more structured proteins, allowing them to stay folded and functional in the absence of the aqueous conditions normally needed to maintain their shape.<br /><br />For now, these observations have only been made with proteins isolated from the tardigrades, so how (or if) the protective mechanisms work within living organisms is still a puzzle. But it does provide yet another example of the water bears&rsquo; bizarre biochemistry. It also leads to the tantalising idea that the mechanisms used by tardigrades to protect themselves from harsh conditions could be utilised to prolong the shelf-life of protein-based therapeutics.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist spring 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

              <h2><a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5926/qa-geoffrey-nice#utm_source=rss">Q&amp;A: Geoffrey Nice</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="Geoffrey Nice, who headed the independent people's Uyghur Tribunal (Lily Vetch)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/9R5A7120-v4.jpg" height="1105" alt="Geoffrey Nice" width="1562" /><br /></em></p> <p><em>Sir Geoffrey Nice QC headed the independent people&rsquo;s Uyghur Tribunal &ndash; an unofficial body of lawyers, academics and businesspeople, based in the UK. In December 2021 it delivered its verdict that China is committing genocide against the Uyghur minority, prompting British MPs to form a cross-party group urging the government to use the same term. In the early 2000s, Nice led the prosecution at the trial of former Serbian president Slobodan Milo&scaron;ević.</em></p> <p><strong>You recently headed a People&rsquo;s Tribunal on the Uyghur in China, which ruled that The People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) is committing genocide against the Muslim minority. How did you reach that verdict? </strong></p> <p>How can one draw general conclusions about an enormous geographical area like Xinjiang Province, which is three times the size of France, from a limited number of in-person witness? First, there was very similar evidence from people not connected to one another, speaking of different camps around Xinjiang. Were these similarities indicative of what is happening in Xinjiang being done pursuant to a policy? If the same thing happens at the hand of officials in Huddersfield as in Penzance and Margate and is evidenced by people who don't know each other, then that's a pointer towards a wider, national policy. Then there were reports from organisations like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch that drew on Uyghur witness testimony, as well as leaked policy documents from the Chinese Communist Party. Those documents set out government and party approaches to the Uyghurs on matters of detention, birth control and so on. There were reports of women detainees forced to take medicine that affected their reproductive functioning, pregnant women forced to undergo abortions, intense surveillance in the community generally, family members incentivised to spy on one another, children forced into state-run boarding schools, and more.</p> <p>As individual accounts from witnesses fitted with all evidence cited in other reports and government policy then what was happening, it could be concluded, was pursuant to a province-wide policy. The tribunal then applied the strictest test of proof beyond reasonable doubt to factual evidence in order to reach factual findings <em>and</em> applied only the law on genocide &ndash; which is subject to some uncertainties and complexities &ndash; about which it could be certain. Accordingly, on the basis of evidence heard in public, the tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, as the judgement read, &ldquo;the PRC, by the imposition of measures to prevent births, intended to <em>destroy</em> a significant part of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang as such, has committed genocide&rdquo;.</p> <p><strong>Many in China appear to believe that the Uyghur population does constitute a security threat, and that the Chinese state&rsquo;s actions are justified. Critics of the ruling Communist Party conversely see a state project to impose a singular Han identity on China. What do you see as the motivation there?</strong></p> <p>You won&rsquo;t find any serious commentator who would say that there is <em>no</em> background of actions by Uyghurs that could represent a security concern; but there's been very little, if anything, recently. Equally, evidence of the encouragement given to Han men to marry Uyghur women clearly speaks to a policy of homogenisation of races. And it was very important at all times to correct the loose public discourse about what's happening in Xinjiang being in some way similar to the Holocaust. It's absolutely nothing like the Holocaust. The Holocaust was concerned with eliminating an ethnic group in Europe altogether. It wasn&rsquo;t concerned with intermarrying; it wasn't concerned with releasing people from death camps back into the community.</p> <p>What&rsquo;s happening in China is very different to what happened to the Jews. We explained at the beginning of the judgment how cautious we were about making a finding of genocide because of the term being rooted, in the popular understanding, in the Holocaust. As to what the overall motivation of the Chinese state is, it would be an overreach of us to make any general finding given the People&rsquo;s Republic of China&rsquo;s management structure, its way of decision-making, its formation of &ndash; and the changeability of &ndash; policy. So, with evidence of a range of motivations, it would be foolish to exclude any one of them &ndash; terrorism or homogenising the population for example, altogether.</p> <p><strong>The tribunal judgement wrote: &ldquo;It is essential to recognise that actions seen as wholly wrong and beyond justification by citizens of liberal democracies, might to citizens of China seem genuinely acceptable and justified for the public good.&rdquo; Why is this point worthy of acknowledgement?</strong></p> <p>It is really wrong to view other people's actions through the lens of one type of society &ndash; in this case, our own &ndash; and with the sensibilities and expectations that such a society may generate. Instead, go back to the terms of the Genocide Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which were signed or acceded to by China / the PRC, the Convention being partly drafted by a Confucian philosopher, Peng-chun Chang. Those international instruments show that whatever the differences in public acceptability of state conduct &ndash; say of the use of force by the police or the methods of detention and so on &ndash; there are standards of conduct necessary for human rights to be respected that are universally acknowledged.</p> <p>There is a great deal of excited commentary around the Uyghur issue that, on examination, clearly applies North European standards. When looking at the PRC, apart from acknowledging its size and its historic misfortune at the hands of others, including our nation, it is very important to recognise that the PRC has done a great deal for its citizens, many of whom are now rich by western standards, having earlier raised millions out of poverty. One should be respectful of its history. It may well be that the citizens of the PRC prefer an authoritarian ruler to the form of government that Westminster offers British people; with such preference may come acceptance of state actions that might be unacceptable elsewhere. The tribunal&rsquo;s job was only to consider and apply the international criminal law that was developed after the Second World War. The tribunal allowed no hint of soft-centred western democratic thinking to enter into its deliberations. There would be no benefit or value in doing that. Likewise emotional response to the evidence would have been of no value.</p> <p><strong>The so-called &ldquo;re-education camps&rdquo; for Uyghurs have been widely reported on. But what did the testimony illustrate in terms of how Uyghurs outside of the camps are policed, and how all-consuming is the state&rsquo;s genocidal project?</strong></p> <p>There was one witness who&rsquo;d been detained in a camp then released then detained again. He said he was actually happier in detention because the nature of control inside was certain, whereas the level and nature of control outside was limitless but uncertain. For example, if you simply went into a mosque, according to some evidence we saw, you exposed yourself to risk of being persecuted and detained; the mosques were emptied and many closed altogether by actions of the state. You had to hand over your phone at checkpoints and everything would be downloaded from the phone. The PRC called this element of download technology their &ldquo;anti-terrorism sword&rdquo;. There were very many other elements of extreme observations and control.</p> <p><strong>Tell us what motivated the founding of a People&rsquo;s Tribunal.</strong></p> <p>We can start with the statement given by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1966 at the beginning of the Russell Tribunal on the Vietnam War. &ldquo;The Tribunal is not a substitute for any institution already in existence: it is, on the contrary, formed out of a void and for a real need.&rdquo; The tribunal said is that it would do this job because others who might have done it did not do as they should have done. Our only interest was in filling a gap of knowledge left needlessly by the failure of governments and other bodies to conduct proper public evidence-based investigation or inquiry. That was the motivating factor. Nothing else. Very serious allegations have been made about a country far away. It&rsquo;s a country that provides the computers we use, the clothes we wear, a country that sends its students here, that funds educational and artistic enterprises here. Even though it&rsquo;s a long way away, the public effectively interacts with China from the moment they buy a t-shirt or computer. And they need to know what is happening in the country where these things are produced. If unbelievable horrors were reported was happening in Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands &ndash; our nearest neighbours &ndash; would it be proper for that information to be made available to the citizens of this country so they can make informed decisions about things they buy? The answer is that of course you need to make it public; of course it would be wrong not to.</p> <p><strong>You led the prosecution at the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. How has your confidence in the ability of international courts to bring justice to victims of genocide and crimes against humanity developed since then?</strong></p> <p>One way of looking at international justice is that it&rsquo;s probably a great deal better than nothing, and nothing is what you had in the 19th century. It was only in the last quarter of the 19th century that the world began to regulate the conduct of war, and only at the beginning of the 20th century that contemplation was given to the post-facto oversight of wrongdoing in war by law. That then developed to a significant extent after the Second World War with the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals and &ndash; later &ndash; with the international tribunals in the 1990s on Rwanda and Yugoslavia. All of that is within quite a short time in historical terms.</p> <p>International law is still in an experimental phase. It&rsquo;s probably too early to make anything like a comprehensive or final evaluation of whether international justice is working, and it&rsquo;s much more important to see what shortcomings there are and try to help people remove them. But most important of all is to say that all of us must hope that some form of &ldquo;law not war&rdquo; &ndash; the phrase that Ben Ferencz, who was chief prosecutor at one of the Nuremberg Trials, uses &ndash; might come about. The pre-First World War enthusiasm for avoiding all war and making all conflicts subject to arbitration or discussion without killing people failed in the 20th century, and it doesn&rsquo;t look much better now. I know Steven Pinker may say that numerically we&rsquo;re killing less, and that may be true, perhaps because we have better targeted weapons. But the desire to attack and fight seems pretty well with us, and the desire to do damage to particular races is often present. The absolutely critical thing for anyone to understand is that, even if you can see the shortcomings of the legal system, it&rsquo;s a great deal better than what came before, and therefore everyone must give their support to it.</p> <p><em>This is the full version of our Q&amp;A from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook&#8217;s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>
