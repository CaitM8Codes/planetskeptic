<p class="lead">The heartbreak of a breakup is worse when you get the news secondhand. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/putin-congratulates-biden-election/2020/12/15/bd8c3444-3ea8-11eb-b58b-1623f6267960_story.html">Putin has parted ways with Trump</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>More than a month later than most world leaders, Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday congratulated President-elect Joe Biden for his victory in the election, a delayed recognition that could set the tone for icy relations.</p>
<p>“In his message Vladimir Putin wished the president-elect every success and expressed confidence that Russia and the United States, which bear special responsibility for global security and stability, can, despite their differences, effectively contribute to solving many problems and meeting challenges that the world is facing today,” the Kremlin said in a statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>I knew all along that the relationship would never work out &#8212; it was a friendship of convenience between two spoiled, selfish people who would only stick together while they thought they could get something from one another. Oh well, Donald still has a few potential dates for the prom on Saturday.</p>
<blockquote><p>Putin was one of the last heads of state to acknowledge Biden’s win; Mexico’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and North Korea’s Kim Jung Un are other holdouts. </p></blockquote>
<p>I can see where Bolsonaro and Kim have a lot in common with the loser-in-chief, but I was baffled by Obrador. Shouldn&#8217;t Mexico be happy to see a bigoted basher out of office? But here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/12/09/mexico-president-still-mum-on-joe-bidens-presidential-victory/3867240001/">a brief explanation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Few expected López Obrador, elected in July 2018, to openly embrace Trump and his hard-line border policies after all the dirt thrown. But that&#8217;s just what happened.</p>
<p>At heart, the two men are nationalists more concerned with domestic business than foreign affairs, experts say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we need to understand that AMLO has an uncommon worldview,&#8221; said Duncan Wood, director of the nonpartisan Wilson Center&#8217;s Mexico Institute in Washington, D.C. &#8220;He is much more focused on what happens internally than what happens in the United States. He wants the world to know he isn’t beholden to the United States.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I can respect that &#8212; it&#8217;s not so much an affection for Trump as it is a need to stand independent of the US, no matter who holds the office.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Good and Evil: the Devil Tempting a Young Woman (1832) by Andr&eacute; Jacques Victor Orsel" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/89710-_1_.jpg" height="689" alt="89710-_1_" width="620" /></p> <p>When Peter Stanford wrote <em>The Devil: A Biography</em> in 1996, a non-fiction book whose premise doesn&rsquo;t need much explaining, it sold remarkably well. Following its success, his publisher sat him down and said, &ldquo;Ooh, we should do the opposite now, shouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Stanford went and wrote <em>Heaven: A Traveller&rsquo;s Guide to the Undiscovered Country</em>. &ldquo;Hardly sold at all,&rdquo; he says.</p> <p>Famously, and as Stanford discovered, we are far more interested in Satan than God. &ldquo;The Devil has all the best tunes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Go to Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company&rdquo; and other such well-worn lines attest to what we all know to be true: sinners are more interesting than saints.</p> <p>A recent high-profile example of this trend is <em>Lucifer</em>, an American TV series whose fifth and penultimate series aired on Netflix in August. The show casts the Devil as a handsome nightclub owner (played by the British actor Tom Ellis), who has moved from Hell to Los Angeles, where he acts as a consultant to the city&rsquo;s police department. Lucifer agonises over whether Chloe, the detective he loves, will be able to bear his true devil face (considerably more burnt and unattractive than his human one). By and large, though, this Satan is nothing to fear: he is one of us, except more charming, strong and attractive. Because it is absolutely not apparent from his appearance, Lucifer tends to say, &ldquo;I am the Devil&rdquo; in almost every episode.</p> <p>There was once a time when such a sympathetic portrayal of the Horned One would have been unthinkable. How did we get here?</p> <p>It was only in the &ldquo;very very very late books&rdquo; of the Hebrew scriptures that a Devil figure appeared, Stanford tells me. There is one in the Book of Daniel. In the Book of Job, the &ldquo;tempter&rdquo; who wants God to challenge Job&rsquo;s faith by stripping him of his wealth and family is the Devil, a prosecutor on the divine council whose role is to highlight a person&rsquo;s failings. But, with some exceptions in its early days, Judaism never really needed Satan. Today, most Jews wouldn&rsquo;t claim to believe in the Devil that, thanks to Christianity&rsquo;s seismic influence, most of us readily understand: the external, malevolent demon who rules over Hell.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>Christianity put a face and a personality on something that had been intangible, says Stanford. In the Epistles of Paul, Satan is revealed to have been the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and in the Book of Revelation he is characterised as a dragon.</p> <p>It was Christianity that began to conceptualise Satan as an external living being &ndash; convenient, Stanford says, because if you murder someone you can always blame the Devil sitting on your shoulder. This version of Satan as existing in flesh and blood would have far-reaching implications for literature, art and films in the years to come.</p> <p>When he was depicted in early Western art, the Devil sometimes shared characteristics with the pagan gods whom Christians demonised as being responsible for natural disasters: he had goat legs like Pan, or facial hair like Bes, an ancient Egyptian dwarf god. Satan has almost exclusively been depicted as male, but still othered: he is an animal.</p> <p>In early Christianity he was reptilian and beastly. As the Church grew in power, having become the official religion of the Roman Empire, it enforced its dictates through fear, as many populist politicians still do today. The ultimate threat, says Stanford, was: &ldquo;The Devil is waiting for you.&rdquo;</p> <p>Satan has always been a product of his time. It was in the Middle Ages that the character began to acquire the traits we now identify as quintessential. Above their chancel arches, mediaeval churches bore a picture of the harrowing of Hell &ndash; the period of time between Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection in which he descended into the underworld. &ldquo;It was a real control mechanism,&rdquo; says Stanford. &ldquo;They wanted to terrify people.&rdquo;</p> <p>The hook-nose began to appear, playing into antisemitic stereotypes to reinforce the superiority of Christianity over Judaism. In Michael Pacher&rsquo;s 15th-century painting &ldquo;The Devil Presenting St Augustine with the Book of Vices&rdquo; we see a figure intended to disgust: unusually, he is green, but has cloven hooves, horns, red eyes, fangs and reptilian wings. For some reason, he also has a face on his bottom.</p> <p>The prospect of Hell seemed like a very real threat. But surprisingly it was also around this period that the most prominent comic presentations of Satan took hold. &ldquo;There was always a comic element to him, otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t have got defeated all the time,&rdquo; says Diarmaid MacCulloch, an academic specialising in the history of Christianity. In mediaeval mystery plays, Satan was often a laughable character who farted and fell over.</p> <p>This, says Stanford, relieved the pressure created by the Church&rsquo;s intense and uncompromising portrayal. Crucially, Satan was always a villain &ndash; and an unattractive one &ndash; who was not portrayed as being enticing.</p> <p>A lot changed with the Renaissance, a period when individual agency was emphasised. &ldquo;What the Renaissance was saying was that individual human beings had capacity; you got away from that collective idea that we&rsquo;re all doomed,&rdquo; says Stanford. If someone was going to seduce you away from the path of righteousness, it would be someone who looked like you. Here we see the beginnings of the idea that runs through the modern hit <em>Lucifer:</em> that the Devil is the person you know.</p> <p>In 1667, John Milton irrevocably altered Satan&rsquo;s image by essentially making him the hero of his epic poem on the fall of man. &ldquo;In Paradise Lost, the Devil is incredibly seductive and good-looking and rather magnificent,&rdquo; says Stanford. Consciously or not, depictions of Lucifer today owe much to this text.</p> <p>As religion&rsquo;s grip began to loosen in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Church stopped presenting Satan as a repulsive figure with horns and a tail. One of the effects of the Enlightenment was to expunge Christianity of these mediaeval relics, ushering in a more terrestrial vision of evil. Religion began to present the Devil as &ldquo;a trickster in disguise&rdquo;, says Stanford.</p> <p>Here we see the inspiration for the more irreverent portrayals of the modern era: Harvey Keitel in Little Nicky; the character in The Simpsons who says &ldquo;Boy, is my face red&rdquo;; South Park&rsquo;s version, in which he is depicted as Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s abusive gay lover.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>Needless to say, the latter in particular relied on centuries&rsquo; worth of dwindling clerical influence. &ldquo;I suspect there is a relationship somewhere,&rdquo; says Stanford, &ldquo;between the decline of organised religion in western culture and laughing at the devil.&rdquo; In Peter Cook&rsquo;s character (and, later, Elizabeth Hurley&rsquo;s) in the film <em>Bedazzled</em>, the point of the Devil is that he &ndash; and, significantly, she &ndash; is good-looking. How else would he manage to seduce people over to the dark side?</p> <p>The Church has &ldquo;stopped playing its Devil card to frighten people&rdquo;, says Stanford. This means that today, to present the Devil as a handsome nightclub owner, as <em>Lucifer</em> does, is playful but no longer risky.</p> <p>&ldquo;Most of western Christianity now has abandoned the idea of Hell,&rdquo; says MacCulloch, &ldquo;so its custodian is not as worrying for believing Christians as he used to be.&rdquo; The fact that Satan is so preposterous to a contemporary audience actually makes him harder to lampoon. A more popular conception of evil today is not a fiery man with horns, but instead something that lurks in the hearts of those who commit unfathomable atrocities.</p> <p>Satan is an enduring symbol, and one that is hardly likely to disappear from popular culture. But in the modern era, it would seem that attention is shifting to the evil of our fellow man, as the explosion in the popularity of true crime documentaries demonstrates.</p> <p>The Devil was born out of a need to put a face to evil. In his absence, it may simply wear a different mask.</p> <p><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2020 edition. </em><em><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p>The 1990s are remembered for Britpop and New Labour. But it was also a time of inequality and racism. In this sixth episode of <a href="/podcast"><em>With Reason</em></a>, we talk to Jason Arday about his new book <em>Cool Britannia and Multi-Ethnic Britain: Uncorking the Champagne Supernova. </em>As a sociologist and long-term Oasis fan, Arday draws on his South London teenage years to interrogate the period from an ethnic minority perspective that has for too long been neglected.<br /><br />A discussion about music and identity, inclusion and exclusion, racism and resistance. For readers of Reni Eddo-Lodge, Robin DiAngelo - and Oasis fans, too.</p> <p><em>Host: Alice Bloch<br /></em><em>Co-host: Samira Shackle<br /></em><em>Producer: Alice Bloch</em><br /><em>Music: Danosongs</em></p> <div><strong>Podcast listeners can get a year's subscription to <em>New Humanist</em> magazine for just &pound;13.50.

This is the podcast brought to you by <em>New Humanist</em> magazine and the Rationalist Association. It's a place where you can find bright new thinking and insight from writers and researchers whose ideas deserve to be heard, but which aren't, of course exempt from being challenged. A place to find intelligent thinking in turbulent, ever-questioning times, exploring matters of reason, unreason, and more.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>Yep, in this series, we've talked about everything from sex robots to virtue signalling, Protestantism to post-work utopias. We've met people like the anthropologist Joe Webster, who has talked to us about his research on faith, hatred and fraternity. We've heard from people like Mariele Pfannebecker, casting a critical eye on the subject of work, labour and desire in late capitalism. There was the feminist, journalist and author Minna Salami, shaking up stubborn ideas of knowledge, and Kate Devlin, an expert in social and cultural intelligence, scoping out the possible future of sex, tech and intimacy. But today, a turn to music, identity and politics.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>Yes, our guest today is Jason Arday, a sociologist who is in no way stuck in the ivory tower. He actually does a lot of work on race and racism and diversity in higher education. And alongside that, he's also the author of <em>Cool Britannia and Multi-Ethnic Britain: Uncorking the Champagne Supernova</em>, which is a really interesting book that challenges the rose-tinted idea of the &lsquo;90s. That's this sort of idea of, obviously, as in the title &lsquo;Cool Britannia&rsquo;, that the &lsquo;90s was this period of utopia and inclusion, and everything was great and rosy and brilliant. So Alice, you and I, like Jason, would have been kids in the mid &lsquo;90s, when that period was underway, Jason reminds us that it wasn't a straightforward story of Britpop, New Labour and football coming home. Before we bring you the main interview with him, here he is talking about that period.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>In terms of, I guess, the Cool Britannia years, one of the things that's kind of really interesting is how people kind of look back on a period of time, I think for a lot of people who kind of grew up during that period it&rsquo;s quite a kaleidoscopic, colourful period, intertwined with kind of, I guess, fantastic culture, fantastic subculture. And the dawn of New Labour also represented something really new or really powerful for a new generation coming through. But I guess the counter-narrative to that is the experience for ethnic minorities. And at that time, it was a particularly hostile environment for black and ethnic minority people within the UK. And you had the Metropolitan Police Service kind of being declared as institutionally racist. And you had basically football hooliganism, in terms of racism, really facilitating these ideas, these kind of abhorrent xenophobia ideas, which were quite divisive, and obviously made it quite a toxic environment for ethnic minorities to live in at the time. And I guess, the hallmark moment, in that kind of encasement of inequality and societal discrimination and racial discrimination, was really, the most seminal moment, was the death of Stephen Lawrence. It was very symbolic of what black people had been facing in the UK 20, 30 years prior to that. It's just I guess, this is the only one that caught fire.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>So in order to study this time, Jason used a method called auto-ethnography. We asked him to explain what that actually is.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>For the actual book, I was very fortunate to interview just over 80 people to get their understanding of the time &ndash; obviously, because at the time I was, I myself was still a child. So it was a case of making sense of that time through people's lived experiences, but in a generational way. I interviewed people who at the time would have been, you know, 50, 40, 30, 20. And then we kind of got into adolescence, which is where I was at the time. And for me, the auto-ethnography is just basically a storytelling tool. So if you're an ethnographic researcher, you normally tell the story within. So you might be doing research where you might examine a group of people, and you may immerse yourself within that group of people. And basically, the idea or the aim is to tell that story as accurately, and where possible, as poignantly as possible, and give those individuals a space or a platform to engage or discuss their lived experiences. And so an auto-ethnography, the auto aspect is probably more centered on my own experiences in that time.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>And how old were you in the period that the book talks about?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>So at the end of &lsquo;90s, I was 15. So I was 15, in 2000. So at the beginning of &lsquo;90s, I was five.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>So we'll come back later to talk about some of the really big events that happened in the Cool Britannia era. But first, maybe you could tell us about how you experienced those years as a child and a young adolescent &ndash; so, where you were born, where you grew up, how you got into music, what kind of music you liked, and so on.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>I'm from Clapham, South London, that's where I was born, and I grew up on a council estate, in relative poverty. But I think the beauty of growing up in that kind of environment was that my parents were fantastic, you know, I never really knew I was poor, until really, I got to university. I had a really nice childhood. I'm autistic. And I have Asperger's and global development delay, so it&rsquo;s a hybrid of autism. And I basically didn't learn to speak until I was 11. And I didn't learn to read and write until I was 18. So one of the things that was kind of really useful, my mum used music as a mechanism to get me to understand the world around me. And it was fantastic, because I was able to learn instruments, or an instrument in terms of playing guitar. And then I was able to just make sense of the world through music. And that's actually apart from having speech therapists. And people on hand helped me a lot &ndash; one of the reasons I was able to come out of signing was just, I was able to make a synergy between music and life. And it made a lot of sense to me in a way that textbooks or more conventional ways of learning didn't make sense. And I guess my kind of association affiliation with the Cool Britannia period is that &ndash; you know, I've got brothers, and they had different interests &ndash; but obviously, I think it wasn't so much that I was a novelty, but I recognise that as a black male, it may have seemed peculiar to people, or strange that here's this black male from South London, who has like, an obsessive interest with four guys from working class Manchester.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>And Jason, when you say that, you're referring to Oasis?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>Oasis. Yeah.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>Tell me a bit about, about why you were so into them, or kind of <em>how</em> you were into them, I suppose. So I think you write about hearing that album <em>Definitely Maybe</em> in 1994? Why did that resonate with you?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>You know I came, I come from a really kind of politically and socially aware family. And a lot of my childhood was actually spent on picket lines and protests with my mum. So I had to, you know, I had as far as a child can have, a good understanding of what kind of class and social mobility meant at that time, and I've been able to take this from kind of songs &ndash; listening to kind of different types of music and stuff, and socialist movements. So stuff around, you know, in terms of when Bob Marley talks about particular types of movements, or particular types of socialism, you know, to a point &ndash; The Jam, those types of things &ndash; I had an okay idea that I was able to relate to the music I&rsquo;d listen to. And basically, I just remember hearing, like I said, the opening chords to &lsquo;Cigarettes and Alcohol&rsquo;, and I was just completely blown away. You know, once I began to learn a bit more about this story, it was the idea of (as I've kind of said in the book) of four kind of working-class people, that have come from nothing, taking on the world and winning. And there was something about that message that just really resonated with me, because I just looked at my surroundings and thought, well, I could do that. I think I could do that. But I guess what you don't factor in are the intersectional inequalities that may prohibit someone from doing that, or that may, you know, the things that might paralyse that ambition. But whilst I was still green, and young, you know, the idea of that was really seductive to me.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>You said there, the &ldquo;intersections&rdquo; of different factors and obstacles that are in place to following that path. What were those?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>Well, I think I think the most obvious one would be my race. So, like, and it's one of those things, that's quite an interesting thing, because my little boy is five, and my daughter's 13. And when I was six years older than Noah is, so 11, my Dad had a conversation with me about kind of being stopped, you know: &lsquo;potentially you will be stopped by police&rsquo;, he had the conversation with me and my brothers. And at the time, I didn't really heed it, I didn't really take it on board, you know, I probably didn't understand what he meant, as well. And then three years later, it actually happened. That was the first time I did get stopped by police. It's one of those things where you try and make sense of that experience, and try and kind of understand why that's happening. And then you recognise that actually, this kind of utopian bubble that you've been living in where you, you know, you kind of entertain the idea of meritocracy for a bit. And you kind of think, &lsquo;No, all things are fair, you know, we're all part of this together&rsquo;. And then you realise you're not, you realise that actually, society works through a kind of a social stratification and within our intersections, and if you're, I guess, unfortunate to tick all of those intersectional boxes in terms of inequality, then things can be quite difficult for you in a really pernicious, violent, structural and systemic way.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>And Jason, you say also that, you know, about loving Oasis, you say you were continually reminded that as a person from your ethnic background, you shouldn't really be into this type of thing. How did that reminding work? Who did it come from? And if I can ask the kind of third question, what did that feel like to value something, to be into it, and to also be told &lsquo;Hey, this isn't really, this isn't really for you&rsquo;.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I felt it was pretty, pretty restrictive. I don't know why, specifically, but I knew from a very early age that the interests I had weren&rsquo;t of people that were born in 1985, if that makes sense. So I was obsessed with &lsquo;60s mod culture, in particular, the styling and the clothing. And I just knew that people didn't have that as a particular interest, for no other reason than people just interested in what they're interested in. So I just felt like if I was interested in that, why should it be anyone's problem, but I guess there are kind of restricted binaries, that regardless of race, we all put one another into. So we all kind of make assumptions and assertions on where people should fit, how they should kind of behave, what they should be into. And I just remember, you know, being right in the middle of that kind of construct. So you had kind of white people who would say, &lsquo;oh, wow, like, why aren&rsquo;t you into rap&rsquo;? And then you'd have black people say, &lsquo;why are you into rock'n'roll, that's not black music&rsquo;. So the irony is, is that rock'n'roll derives from black heritage and black music, and the idea of rap &ndash; it depends what kind of what we're talking about, because if we're talking about rap that kind of denigrates other women of colour. I'm not really into that. But if we're talking about more progressive acts, who talk about black people in a more positive way, so I don't know De La Soul, Arrested Development, Public Enemy, then that's, that's a different type of narrative we're talking about.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, one of the things that you say in your book is that you loved Oasis, but you also felt the music didn't speak to your racialised experiences. And could you explain a bit more about what you meant by that?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>Yeah. So what I thought the music spoke to was, you know, more of a class narrative. I guess that was kind of really exacerbated and jumped up, like sexualising the news, because you had the class war between, you know, Blur (who was seen as, these are students who had gone to Goldsmith&rsquo;s from middle-class dwellings. And then kind of these almost ruffian Mancunians who'd kind of, you know &ndash; Noel Gallagher famously said, you know, &lsquo;Does, you know, the fact that I've worked on a building site, does that make my soul more pure than Damon Albarn&rsquo;s&rsquo;? and his answer was like, &lsquo;Yes, it does&rsquo;. And those type of things. It was that whole idea, you know: &lsquo;I'm really working-class&rsquo;. I guess one of the things that's kind of really interesting is that the music itself, it was almost like &ndash; for want of a better term &ndash; it was it was, it was an act of resistance. I was about to say a rude word. It was an act of resistance to, you know, the kind of oppressive structures that had really been enshrined in, in kind of legislation and law through kind of oppressive Conservative rule. And then kind of what you had was effectively, you know, a rebuttal to that. And yes, there was a glorification of kind of sex, drugs and rock&lsquo;n&rsquo;roll. But it was almost in a way where I was like, that's all we've got, you know, and we want to talk about it in this really kind of visceral, kind of raw way. And subsequently, as I got older, you recognise that these kinds of movements reinvent themselves &ndash; so I guess, you know, the reiteration before that was kind of punk. And then the kind of reiteration before that was kind of rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, but before that was rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll taken from blacks and resold to whites, type thing. So you kind of recognise that these kind of have several different reincarnations. And, you know, for me, it was something about that, but I guess you recognise the racial dissonance aspect, that that aspect comes because your reality isn't theirs, really.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>But when something happens to you, like getting stopped and searched as a teenager, which you described as kind of moment of awakening, does that change your relationship to the music? Obviously it changes your outlook, perhaps. But does your relationship to that music that's spoken to you so much on all these certain levels, if not others, does that shift at all?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>It doesn't, it shifts because it becomes, it goes from a moment of inclusion to exclusion very quickly and in a very raw way. And what you don't realise is that kind of that early experience is &lsquo;finishing school&rsquo; for what you encounter as an adult. And it's a difficult thing to comprehend. When you were 14, you know, you were with two white people, you get stopped by police. The police ask you &lsquo;where have you been?&rsquo; And the two white people you're with ask you &lsquo;what did you do?&rsquo; Because, you know, part of their conditioning is that, you know, black people do engage in criminal activity. And I guess what you end up preparing for is a lifetime of this, which &hellip; when it happened at 15 you know, I consciously thought this could be like this for the rest of my life. And actually, up until this point, I've been stopped every year by police since I was 14. So you know, and sometimes it can be 345 times a year. This year has been once but. you know, I thought because of lockdown. I might get away from that. But it happened. So, it doesn't change the relationship with the music per se. You just become more cognisant of what speaks to your lived reality and what doesn't. In terms of a momentary type of escape for 90 odd minutes, I can listen to that album, and I'm taken back to when I first heard it. But actually, if I listen to an album like <em>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,</em> which I think is, you know, top three Greatest Albums of All Time, that album speaks to a lived reality of a lot of one young black women and to young black people full stop, trying to find a place in a very divisive, racialised and discriminatory world. And that is powerful. There&rsquo;s music speaks to you on one level, and there's music that speaks to your lived experience. And that's, I guess, the emotive part of it.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>I guess what we're talking about here is quite a complicated idea of what music should really be to a person and how you should relate to it. And I guess kind of lurking underneath, for me, there's quite a quite a sad question, or suggestion, that the music you listen to or enjoy should kind of correspond with your own identity or experience &ndash; that the lyrics should kind of match your life, or that the person performing should look like you, or should have the same background as you. What do you think to that? That's surely something we should resist? Because I know that's not, at least consciously, that's not how I choose the music I listen to, or maybe I do and I'm not aware of it.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, no, I definitely think it's something we should resist against, because I think music&rsquo;s there to be enjoyed. I think once you start placing labels and binaries on it, I think it becomes difficult. You know, admittedly, what I would say is, having someone that does look like you is impactful. So you know Deborah Anne Dyer, aka Skin from Skunk Anansie, seeing, you know, this beautiful, androgynous, queer black woman occupying a space that has kind of inherently been held by, you know, white men, that is a powerful thing. You know, when you see kind of iterations of that, you know, when you see kind of, you know, someone like a Lenny Kravitz, those types of people that they are like, are inspiring because they're doing something that is perceived to be white actually &ndash; it isn't why, I mean, rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll's origins are from 1930s Black America. It's kind of a segue, but I remember kind of going into the early noughties and I remember going to a pub in Deptford in 2000, or 2001. And I went in there and there was this band, they were like a punk act. I saw that the front man was, like, well, thought it was the sound man. So you know, even kind of adding to my own potential ignorance. The black sound man. It wasn't a sound man. He was the frontman of the band. And that frontman turned out to be Kele Okereke, who's the front man of Bloc Party. And when he played the opening chords to &lsquo;Helicopter&rsquo;, which was the first time I'd heard it, then I couldn't believe that I was seeing this black man fronting up basically a punk rock band, or a band that had taken their origins from &hellip; and it just kind of made me, you know, it was a powerful thing to see that. So I think it's important that we don't we look at those two things as separate things. You know, Morrissey is a prat. But you know, does that take away from the fantastic music he put together with the Smiths? I would argue not.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>You're listening to <em>With Reason</em> with me, Alice Bloch -</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>and me Samira Shackle.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>And today we're with Jason Arday. He's talking to us about his book <em>Cool Britannia and Multi-Ethnic Britain</em>. If you're interested in music and politics, why not subscribe to the <em>New Humanist </em>magazine, where you'll also be able to access our digital archive. Like <em>With Reason, New Humanist</em> is published by the Rationalist Association &ndash; and Samira, who can vouch for it because she's the Editor. If you head to newhumanist.org.uk/withreason, you will also find reading lists and transcripts linked to each episode of this podcast.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>So far today, we've heard about Jason's experience of using music as a way of understanding the world around him growing up with autism, and how his love of Oasis offered him a way of thinking about class and social mobility. But he also came to experience what he calls racial dissonance to contemplate questions of inclusion and exclusion, including when he was stopped and searched by police as a teenager.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>Now, as Jason's book makes clear, the &lsquo;90s was a time of inequality and racism in the UK: two things that have hardly disappeared. He writes about the murder of Steven Lawrence, a black teenager from South London killed in a racist attack in 1993. That led eventually to the McPherson report, which came out in 1999, and accused the Metropolitan Police of institutional racism, making recommendations aimed at ensuring zero tolerance for racism, both in the police and other bodies. We asked Jason what significance the murder and the reports had for discussions about racism in the UK, all unfolding at the same time as so-called &lsquo;Cool Britannia.&rsquo;</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>I think for British society, while it may have been a seminal moment for British society, generally speaking there was no seminal aspect for black and minority ethnic people. They'd been experiencing that you know, from the earliest iterations of the Windrush generation. And prior to that. So it wasn't a surprise, you know, I think the fact that it was, you know, it took the murder of a teenager, to go from being a peripheral subject and a peripheral issue, residing on the margins, to then occupying a political centre. Because at the time, you know, the New Labour government, and particularly Jack Straw who commissioned that report, I don't think it told, you know, black people, ethnic minorities, anything they didn't already know.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>But am I right, that you, you also talk about how the Macpherson report at least spoke of institutional racism, and that this was potentially a time &ndash; and I hope I'm not misunderstanding, the point that you make &ndash; where we saw more of an understanding of racism as a collective issue that needed in practice, hopefully, but at least in theory needed to be collectively addressed.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think the commissioning of the report by the then Home Secretary Jack Straw, it was a seminal moment in British history, because it gave us a framework to engage in race equality, intervention, and work, and think about how, as a British society, we might dismantle this generational legacy of racism. And the promise of the report and the recommendations preferred, really gave us a catalyst and a framework for us to work through or work with, as a society. I guess, the sad thing is, is that tracing the contours of racism, or keeping ahead of the contours of racism, in itself is quite a difficult act, because it's able to reinvent itself all the time. And where I guess people become, you know, racially, you know, battle fatigued, it's very difficult to kind of stay agile, of that ever-changing kind of pernicious face. So it's difficult, you know, you can have different types of race legislation. But actually, you know, racism is becoming more covert, more intelligent, it's really, you know, reinvents itself in a very insidious, intelligent way. And that is actually quite a hard thing to keep abreast of. So the recommendations for that report, in many respects, whilst they are a useful framework for us to frame our understandings around racial discrimination, and institutional racism, actually, are they relevant? Are they specific to, you know, are they effective, you know, do they remain functional to the racism that we encounter now, but I could probably make an argument that they don't just because racism has become so much more intelligent. And actually, it's not the overt examples that one should gravitate towards anymore. It's the more covert subtle forms of racism, that kind of keep people of colour on the periphery of, you know, Britain's major institutions.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>So your point in the book, and from what you're saying, your point seems to be that we need to be more honest in squaring two narratives, one being the sort of dominant discourse that frames the &lsquo;90s as a time that was very tolerant and inclusive. And to square that with the reality which you describe in the book as the eternal struggle for racial equality, which as you've just said, is, you know, something that's very much ongoing, and to kind of square that framing against the backdrop of the Steven Lawrence murder? So do you think that's right? Do you want to square those two narratives, the dominant discourse of &lsquo;the &lsquo;90s is inclusive&rsquo; with this whole backdrop of the Steven Lawrence murder? And what that tells us about racial inequality and kind of addressing this amnesia?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>I think so, because I think the selective amnesia is a problem. I think when people talk about the 1990s, they do talk about it from a very, you know, euphoric, and colourful point of view, you know, and, and for people of colour, it really wasn't, you know, for black and ethnic minority individuals in Britain, it wasn't that and I do think it's important when we're talking about it, you know, if we reside in a multicultural society, then we can't be selective with the types of histories we engage with. And if we think about that particular time, that was a horrible time for black people. There is no getting away from that. And I think that, um, the fact that we don't ever talk about what the &lsquo;90s may have been like for black people, you know, after Stephen Lawrence, those actually, those natural increases in race related crimes, you know, racist kind of savagery towards people of colour.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>Jason, you, you dedicate your book to Stephen Lawrence's parents, and you describe them as unrelenting in their pursuit for racial equality in Britain. As we've been discussing, that's a struggle that's obviously far from over. How do you see things changing, if at all, as we look into the 2020s towards post-Brexit Britain. Incidentally, actually, I guess a lot of the &lsquo;Leave&rsquo; imagery around Brexit was quite Cool Britannia. But maybe that's an observation for another day. But yeah, how are things? How are things changing? What are your hopes?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>I think it's better to reside in hope. And it's difficult to say things are changing. And I think that we, sadly, we have a government that doesn't particularly endorse, you know, diversification or inclusivity, or, you know, multicultural kind of cohesion. So it's very hard to take any kind of direction from those types of individuals that occupy the Premiership and governance, but what I would say is, I think what is emerging is a consciousness around kind of racism, and how people can engage in anti-racist endeavour, and actually just generally speaking, intersectional endeavour in terms of dismantling intersectional inequality. And I think, I think if there was a time for collectivity, I think this is it, I think, you know, sometimes it feels were like, twitching fingers, absent purpose, when really what we need is a fist, you know, a fist of solidarity in terms of charging at this omnipresent, sustained, structural problem that is just kind of racial inequality. And I think the capacity of human beings to do good, can never be underestimated, against a torrent of inequality, just generally speaking.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>Okay, so last question, Jason. Do you still love Oasis and do your children love Oasis?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>My little boy knows Oasis songs. My daughter's had no choice but to listen to Oasis songs, you probably won't meet someone who wants them to get back together more than me. But I don't think they will. Because they keep going &lsquo;no&rsquo;, so it just won't happen. But I've probably listened to &lsquo;Definitely Maybe&rsquo; every day since I was 14. I listen to it every morning when I when I get up. So it still has a huge impact on me. And I think everything I do is because of the line of work I do is through a critical lens. And actually it&rsquo;s one of few things I try not to do that with, because as problematic as those individuals may be, in terms of general intersectional equality, I separate that from the music. If I had to, you know, if I had to align a moral compass to all of the music I listen to, then I'm not really sure what else I could listen to. I'm not really sure what music anyone could listen to. So yeah, I do still listen to Oasis, because it is still, I think, one of the, in my 35 years of existence, I still think it is one of the best stories ever told, you know &ndash; that, for me, was a huge, huge point of inspiration that helped me throughout my teens and helped me to make sense of the world I lived in. And it's definitely had, well, I ended up being fortunate to write about that time because of their albums. So, yeah, it's huge.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>So Jason, before you go, this is where we take a bit of time to look into the <em>New Humanist </em>archive, for a piece that you might want to reflect on or maybe rewrite entirely. And you've been looking at something from last year, which is David Wearing's review of <em>Decolonising the University</em>, a collection of essays prompted in part by the Rhodes Must Fall campaign at the University of Cape Town. You've written a lot on race and racism in higher education, and done a lot of activism around that also. And David's review notes that unexamined ideas about the history of Empire, and its supposed kind of benefits, remain a profound force in our society, not least in the place where they originated: the elite intellectual culture, I guess, pointing at universities. Would you agree with that statement?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>Yes, I would agree with that. And I think that the premise for the ivory tower still stands upon the beams of imperialism and the Empire. And I think the problem with that is that it's what it occupies, it's kind of what it symbolises: so the canons of knowledge we engage with, the gatekeepers to knowledge, the people who are seen as the facilitators of knowledge. And in itself, it has created or it sustains, you know, that legacy has sustained an exclusive space that marginalises you know, black, and, you know, different types of indigenous individuals from the Global Academy. And in particular, you know, the British Academy, and that is a difficult thing. But what I do think is, is that actually, again, similar to, you know, a lot of discussions around race, it's resided on the margins. And this is maybe the first time really, it's gone from the margins to the centre of kind of dominant discourse. And that is a symbol for hope that is really important, because now we're beginning to think about how we challenge these structures, how we dismantle this colonial hangover and legacy to create something that is more egalitarian and more reflective of our lived histories, our lived experiences and also the contribution of black people to the British Empire, because without that contribution, you don't have an empire. And that is a really central thing, that black people contributed more to the British Empire. Then beyond slavery, I think slavery is a really reductionist and lazy way of engaging with the contribution of black people to British culture and British history. It's a really, it's a really lazy way. It doesn't, you know, speak to the black suffragette movement, it doesn't speak to black activism, it doesn't speak to black philanthropy, doesn't speak to black enterprise, there are so many things it doesn't speak to that had those interventions not happened, you know, the British economy system, as we know, it wouldn't be where it is now.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>In terms of decolonising the curriculum, thinking about your field, sociology, what text would you want to see students reading more of and what might you want to remove?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong></p> <p>I won't say anything about what I'd want to remove purely because I think all types of knowledge are important. What I would say is, I would like to see a decentering of white knowledge as the central knowledge canon, in favour of something that was more representative and reflective of all types of knowledge from all different types of ethnicities and backgrounds. That being said, I guess the kind of literature I'd like people to engage with more is, you know, the work of people like Kimberl&eacute; Crenshaw, who does a lot of work around intersectionality, you know, aspects around black feminism in particular, which I've always found very interesting and liberating. So people like Professor Heidi Mirza, or bell hooks, the work of people such as Gus John, I think are really important in terms of understanding historical movements, around education society, generally speaking. And I think most importantly, there's a fantastic generation of academics coming up who are really talking about these intersectional issues. And what I would like to see is that kind of diversification of, you know, the canon.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>Okay, well, that's a great reading list to be getting on with. And Jason Arday, thank you very much.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>Jason Arday, author of <em>Cool Britannia and Multi-Ethnic Britain: Uncorking the Champagne Supernova</em>. Samira, it's a tough thing that Jason seems to be doing here. He's kind of interweaving broader sociological claims with his own very personal story. And that's a story that kind of includes this long-standing relationship with a band Oasis that is part of a culture that he's, at points, been caused to question. It's interesting also, to hear his thoughts, I suppose on what the education sector could do to improve the state of things now, here in the UK. What strikes you most anyway, from today?</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>Firstly, I think the fact that he's listened to <em>Definitely Maybe</em> every day since he was 14, which is quite an incredible dedication to a band. And also I think as a broader point, this idea of how we relate to music. And what it does for us, I think, is a really fascinating one. So Jason spoke about his own personal perspective of coming to music as a way to relate to the world. And obviously that's hugely informed his criticism, having this kind of unusual entry point to music in a way. But I think it's something we can all think about, that we all get different things from different music, and by extension, different kinds of art at different points. And I think this, this kind of conversation about representation, and, you know, having more artists from ethnic minorities, for instance, whether that's musicians or whatever, I think that that conversation can often get quite caricatured. But there is a much more kind of nuanced point there about why it's important to see yourself reflected in art forms.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think that stuff on musical taste was so interesting. I think we could have talked a lot longer about that, definitely. I mean, there's this question of how there can be a kind of dissonance between what you listen to, and then what you feel the culture that you're actually part of kind of actually entitles you to listen to, what culture kind of welcomes you and what doesn't, and it's okay to listen to something that you kind of enjoy aesthetically, instinctively, but that maybe you feel to be part of a broader cultural moment, that isn't somehow meant for you. There's also this question of kind of whether it's, I suppose, necessary for music to actually speak to you, in a literal sense. As I said, in the interview: I find that kind of a slightly challenging idea, I suppose, that really we should maybe want to sometimes listen to things where the lyrics speak very literally and directly to us, or where the performer, the singer, looks like us. I don't think that's kind of the only way in which we should enjoy culture. But obviously, it's also a necessary one at points. And I think that was a really interesting thing that we could have drawn out with Jason there, much, much more. Finally, I suppose there's the more political question of whether it's okay to like music by people whose politics you reject. That's quite a kind of hot topic for debate, I'm sure. I mean, we have Jason there saying &lsquo;Morrissey is a prat&rsquo;, to quote him, but that doesn't detract from the quality of the music he created with the Smiths necessarily. I get the feeling that's something that could be discussed for a really, really long time, but I guess, music aside, there's also the much more serious discussion that we had with Jason there about identity, race and racism in the UK over these past 20, 30 years that he's discussing.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, what really struck me there was this idea of racism being a collective problem for all of us in society, rather than exclusively being a problem for people from ethnic minority communities. I think that that is still really prescient, it's very much a work in progress, this idea that it's not only people who suffer at the hands of racism who should be worried about racism, and that actually, if we want to live in a kind of healthy and equitable society, that's something that we should all be concerned about. Because change only comes when it's something that everyone is engaged in.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I guess in a way that maybe relates back to the interview we did with Minna Salami the other day, about kind of protest in progress, and kind of holistic approaches to knowledge and to change. So I guess that's worth listening to as well, I suppose separately. Jason also was talking very much about nostalgia during that interview &ndash; albeit a rose-tinted kind of nostalgia for the &lsquo;90s. And it made me wonder really, whether we could be nostalgic in the same way today, or whether actually maybe the &lsquo;90s is the last period for which we can have a kind of collective kind of simplified nostalgia. I really wish I'd asked Jason about whether, you know, he thinks maybe kind of the rise and rise and rise of the internet, to put it very simply, has meant that we're more likely to have a kind of plurality of narratives and histories out there, around say, what the 2000s were, what the 2010s have been, what the 2020s will be. I feel like maybe the internet has made it much easier to create our own individual stories and histories and memories.</p> <p><strong>SS:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think that's interesting. You see these things sort of proliferate about nostalgia for the &lsquo;90s. I mean, I feel like every few weeks, I see some kind of listicle being shared around this, that's like, &lsquo;you'll remember these things if you were a kid in the &lsquo;90s&rsquo;. And it's like, pictures of game-boys or whatever. And people really kind of lap that up. And I've always kind of assumed that that's more to do with, just generally people like to see things that were familiar from their childhood reflected back to them. But I do wonder if that's something that will shift as maybe we have, as you say, with the internet and so on, a bigger divergence around what the kind of dominant cultural symbols are. I don't know if we have them in the same way or not.</p> <p><strong>AB:</strong></p> <p>Yeah, well, who knows what the 2020s will hold in store. Hopefully more episodes of <em>With Reason</em>.

It's the place where you'll find intelligent thinking to illuminate our often murky, turbulent times.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>In this series, we'll be meeting thinkers who prompt questions like, what does it take to truly listen? How might we think differently about reason and unreason? And what does the future hold when it comes to the complex relationship between intimacy and technology? Coming up next week, we'll be talking about the so called "cool Britannia" years, about nostalgia and also our blind spots. But in this episode, we're meeting an author concerned with the world of work and desire in our current era of late capitalism.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Our guest today is Mariele Pfannebecker, who's the co-author, with James A. Smith, of a new book called <em>Work Want Work</em>. It's a really fascinating book that looks at the way that the logic of work has crept into pretty much everything that we do, even when we try to escape it. And even as work for so many people has become ever more precarious.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>In fact, now that a global pandemic has upended work as we know it, the book couldn't be more relevant. But first we started by asking Mareila to define the term "life work regime", an idea that's central to the book,</p> <p><strong>Mariele Pfannebecker: </strong></p> <p>I guess the two things I was struck with, on the one hand, the way in which work tends to take over life more and more for so many of us, so that many people are over-employed, and are working too many hours to be able to do their jobs in all sorts of professions, from doctors working at hospitals to Uber drivers, that at the same time, there was the sense in which even when we are ostensibly enjoying our free time online, just hanging out, doing nothing in particular, that is, of course, as we all know, now working for platform capitalist companies that are extracting value from that. But not just that, but also the way in which we are acting online, the way in which we are always compelled to self-valorise, our self-representation in our free time is also a sort of work. And I guess that just made us think of the way in which this is a very peculiar moment where on the one hand, there's this incredible anxiety about work vanishing, and at the same time, work has taken over everything.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>There are all sorts of punishments aren't there, for avoiding work? I mean, not only the obvious one of not being able to finance your life, but more complex, nuanced ways in which we're punished for not working</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>Well, yes, absolutely. If you don't work, you don't exist, I guess. And in a time, where so much of life happens online, more and more people are isolated from other people, then of course, if those platforms require that you work at your self-valorisation, your self-presentation in a saleable format, then, of course, that means that there isn't any room to be, to exist outside those narrow formats.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>How did we get to this point? So if you look back to the earlier 20th century, and you talk about this in the book, people like Keynes and other thinkers hoped that in the future, we'd be spending less time working. But actually, that's not at all what's happened, even though we do in theory, have all these labour-saving devices and increased automation and so on, we've still ended up working more and more. So why do you think that is?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>I mean, I can't give you a very detailed, complex economic answer to that. But I think ultimately, it's simple it is capitalism. Capitalism does always extract the maximum amount of labour out of people. Not just that it will find the, and in some ways that is even more interesting to me, it will find ways to extract value from the rest of life, the life that isn't labour, that isn't wage labour that you're not paid for. And it will find - obviously in an unregulated free market, capitalism will always keep on going because of its need to expand in whatever crevices of life It can manage to access.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>So we'll talk more later about this question of how we're put to work online in our era of late capitalism, and also questions around how our desires are performed and profited from but for now, we wanted to talk a bit about the traditional world of work. So some concepts that you discuss in the book are malemployment and disemployment. Could you tell us what those mean?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>So I guess when we were thinking about malemployment, we were just thinking about a way to combine in one term, a phenomenon that affects different people in different ways, different ways in which work has gotten worse. So malemployment is both the person that is over employed and working too many hours in order to fulfill their contract contractual obligations, and those who are underemployed, who are part time without wanting to be, who are precarious without wanting to be, in order to show that those two phenomena are related. Disemployment then is the even bleaker term, which again, shows a sort of fusion of different situations. And this time, the fusion is that between the position of the person who is actually unemployed, and the position of the person who is officially employed, but whose life situation and work situation is just as bad as that of the person who's unemployed. So there's a sense in which those two are fused, and then beyond that, disemployment, I guess, also speaks to those who just vanish from the figures altogether, those people who no longer turn up in unemployment figures, because of the draconian measures that have been put in place, you know, the incredible amount of hoops you have to jump through to even get any sort of benefit, the various humiliations that are built in, the various ways in which you get rejected, that more and more people just sort of disappear from those stats altogether, and just subsist in whatever way they can.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>It's interesting to hear you talk about those concepts in the current moment. So the Covid-19 pandemic has seen such drastic, sweeping changes to the world of work. I wonder how you think those concepts might help us think about some of the changes we've seen - like there's the furlough scheme, or all manner of other shifts,</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>I think there's no end of things we can think about there. And maybe the first one is that certain things that are already the case become even more apparent through the Covid crisis regarding work. So for example, the fact that if you think about the way in which so many of us do what David Graeber has called "bullshit jobs", jobs that aren't really very meaningful and that people don't feel particularly personally satisfying. But some people do - people who are, for example, carers, or teachers, carers, whether that's social carers or medical carers and teachers, and those important public services are so cruelly underfunded. And through the political choices that have been made, that it's become very undesirable to work in those professions. And they've come under a lot of pressure. A crisis like this just brings those pressures out more. Then more generally, I think the furlough scheme is an interesting one, of course, on the one hand it is this terrible sort of cloud on the horizon. If there are 4 million people on furlough right now, but won't be in a few weeks, then what will happen? What will happen to them? What will happen to the economy, which has been so good at airbrushing employment figures for so long, but also, I guess, on a slightly more positive note, or at least a slightly more sort of surprising, weird note, there have been quite a few people who, thanks to the furlough scheme, have actually had nothing very much to do for a few months. And I guess, in terms of the utopian ideas of post-work that we also discussed in the book, the question was: what did that mean? Did that mean that there was some sort of utopian potential in a small way unfolding? Some people have started baking sourdough bread or whatever. But really, quite a lot of people have also reflected, you know, on social media and elsewhere on how they just felt anxious and stuck, and how know they couldn't just sit down and read a book, just because suddenly, there was some time in the day. And that seemed kind of interesting, as a sort of symptom of how anxious and weird and terminally unhealthy our relationship to our work has become that when it's gone, there's just nothing left, like nothing left of life, other than to be stressed and anxious, because you don't know what's gonna happen next.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>It's like, we don't know how to conceive of ourselves outside of our jobs.</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>Exactly.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Even though those jobs aren't always satisfying.</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>Yes. And that shows the profound way in which, you know, our subjectivities have been shaped by this very anxious work scape. And how you know, that's why we need utopias because they may not be around the corner at any given point, but they will help us to - we absolutely need them to begin to think about what we want instead, and how we might get there.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>It's interesting on that kind of subject - the way that the furlough scheme ostensibly gave lots of people free time and a salary. Lots of people have said in that context, that the Covid-19 crisis could give us a chance to think differently about how to organise society. But I mean, obviously, that doesn't particularly seem to be happening in any kind of long-term sense so far. But some of those problems that we've spoken about so far, so the lifework regime and malemployment and disemployment and so on. Are there practical things that we could do in the short to medium term that would offset those. So with something like more robust labour protections, for instance, help, or are we talking about something much more wholesale, like a shift in the very definition of work?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>I think that absolutely more robust labour protections is the first step to any sort of change in Britain right now. And you know, especially with the political sort of situation as it is now, and some of the hope rather, having gone out of it, I think that is that is precisely the place to locally make a difference. And, you know, to kind of reunionise, up from the ground to try and try and fight for those rights is definitely, definitely a starting point. But of course, the context, the great historical context of the union's post Second World War is very different from one from the one that we have now. And it's not that easy to unionise, as people have found against capitalist platforms. And that, I guess, is where the political struggle has to begin, to identify what's different, and what's standing in the way of precisely that sort of collective organisation in the kind of work scape that we're stuck in now,</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>We've talked about the bad sides of work, and also the anxiety that some people feel when they're suddenly being given free time. But maybe we can talk about the sense of purpose in life that it gives too many people. I mean, maybe their sense of purpose can be found through other means. Would you say that work is no more than a distraction from thinking about what we really want? Or what we would otherwise maybe do with our lives?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>Well, that's an interesting question. In a way, it's not so much that I'm interested in getting rid of work. But the question is really what that word means work. People, of course, do want to do things with their time that gives them a sense of achievement, a sense of satisfaction, in one way or another. But what that sense of achievement might be, what that sense of satisfaction could be - that really is the question. And this is something that James and I were interested in, when we were looking at what post-work writers to date were thinking about regarding what that utopia should really look like. And we were really struck by the way in which people were pretty quick to gravitate towards a very bourgeois sense of self improvement. Even Marx himself talks about, oh, well, we'll reorganise work in such a way that you can go fishing for a couple of hours, and then do some agriculture, and then do some criticising in the evening. All of these things are great, but they're not everybody's idea of fun or having a good life. So I guess we're interested in - it's not that there's anything wrong with those things. But what we're interested in is precisely that philosophical juncture of making ourselves aware that if we're talking utopia, if we're talking about a complete reorganisation of what work should be, then we also have to be clear about who decides what's good. Who decides? What's the good life? You know, where does autonomy and self-determination come in? What's great for one person isn't for another and as a culture, I think we are quite confused about what's good about the work we do and what kind of work we might be doing instead. And I guess, one of the most obvious examples that a lot of feminist writers have began to talk about, is the question of revaluing what social care, and care work more generally means, how it's valued by a culture and by society and how it could be reorganised to be more pleasurable to the people who do it, as well as the people who depend on it.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>You're listening to <em>With Reason</em> with me Niki Seth-Smith,</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And me Samira Shackle.

We've also talked about the misery of mal and unemployment,</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>But beyond the material world of work, Mareile's book also talks about digital labour. We asked her what this means. After all, if it refers to what we do online in our free time, how does it relate to work?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>In terms of what you do in your own free time, I guess on the one hand, it talks about the way in which we present ourselves online and how that is, you know, very hard work when you're self-valorising when you're turning your social media profile into a CV, but we're also thinking about digital labour in a slightly different way. We're thinking about people who - and of course, these are exceptional figures, but they're useful for thinking with anyway - we were thinking of people who, via internet celebrity are literally turning their social lives online into a profession. Now this happens on YouTube and Instagram and various platforms. Of course, it doesn't happen nearly as often and isn't anywhere close to as likely a career as many young people I know seem to think, but it is something that happens. And I feel like it's become paradigmatic for the kind of aspirational idea of how to make money right now. So the idea that somehow on social media, you can simply be yourself in as charming away as possible, and then get immediately remunerated via these platforms, whether it's via advertisement revenues, or via commissions, or whatever, is very attractive, of course, because it literally turns working into something that's more closely related to receiving a reward. And that, of course, you know, is related to a concept that we talked about, which is young girlification. But I guess what we're interested in is what an illusion that is; that this idea is offered out that you can be famous not by working really hard at becoming a footballer, and then being famous or whatever - no, you can be famous by literally just being yourself online and then getting money for it. Of course, what that also means is that the traditional structures of the workplace are abolished at the same time, so that of course, if one day you no longer please your social media audience, then that job has disappeared. There's no sick pay, there's no tribunals, there's nothing you can do. Now, of course, we aren't scholars of internet celebrity, and we're not Media Studies people as such, what we were interested in nonetheless, is how this is paradigmatic for the way in which work works increasingly, for everyone. So that the extent to which people become disposable, and the extent to which there's an effective way in which people have to sell themselves regardless of the other skills that they bring to their job. So it's not about you being perfect at your craft. But no matter what you do, you have to be perfect at that craft of self-representation at the same time.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>You mentioned there the young girlification. So in the book, you draw on this theory of the young girl and young girlification, which was advanced by the French anarchist collective Tiqqun. Could you tell us a bit about that? And what that theory tells us?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, certainly. So quite a controversial little book, that has been decried for being sexist. Just one line from it that really struck me, or struck us, sums up what we're interested in there, which is the idea that these days everybody is a young girl, even the Pope. So this idea that young girlification has something to tell us about the way in which the world of work, but maybe even subjectivity itself, under disorganised capitalism looks like. And I guess what I'm particularly interested in here, isn't the question whether there is something you know, femme about the way in which we're being duped by the workplace now, but more specifically, something to do with actually the history of industrial capitalism, and the way in which women lost so much power when there was that move in the 18th, 19th century in Britain first and then the rest of the world, where the home economy moved, was broken up by the move towards the factories, and women were disempowered by the fact that increasingly, they didn't have access to the wealth of the family, by virtue of the wage. And what is the effect of that? Well, people have called it different things: in the 80s, housewife-isation, feminisation of labour, but one way or another, we're describing a situation where on the one hand, you have a precarious relationship to work, whether that's by literally having to, you know, be sexually attractive to the wage earner in order to not be kicked out as it were, or whether it is just having a more precarious relationship to work itself, such as domestic labour, etc. But one way or another, I guess, young girlification, historically. It's just a history of how women were excluded from the family wage, from the more secure forms of labour, but ultimately how there's something about that situation of women under industrial capitalism, which grew and grew into something, which now everybody does. So everybody has to be desirable in order to have any chance to make money. Everybody is precarious. Everybody has this anxious all-encompassing relationship to their work. And I guess what we're particularly interested in that - sorry, to just wrap that up - is this idea of the link between desirability and disposability. So if the way in which you get to work is by presenting yourself as desirable in yourself, your person and your looks in every way, then the instant that that judgment is: no, you no longer are desirable, you vanish from that workplace. So this abolition of skill and craft as the thing that qualifies you for work, and this move towards this desirable celebrity simulation inall forms of work. An Uber driver has to do this, because of the way in which they're reliant on feedback and and in getting good feedback from every single customer. Just as much as a university lecturer has to do it, who now depends on getting 100% student satisfaction in order not to fail, they're the next assessment. So it's a strange way in which that way in which you have to, please the big daddy of capitalism has sort of encompassed all of life and all of subjectivity that we're interested in there,</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Just to summarise, as it is quite a complex theory. So the idea would be that today, regardless of what gender we are, we all could be said to be young girls, to the extent that we're obsessed with perfecting our own image, or rather, we need to be attentive to our self-representation. But surely, this relates to some people more than others, like some people are more disposable than others, or some people are more precarious than others. And a provocative question: would Mark Zuckerberg be a young girl in this context?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>Well, good question. And just before I answer that part of your question, I wanted to say that it is, of course, also important to remember that this isn't only a trope, this isn't only an image for thinking with, it's also a useful way to remember that the absolutely, unequivocal vast majority of precarious workers in the world are women. So there is a real, material connection to being a woman in this idea of the young girl. But nonetheless, capitalism has clearly worked out a very good way at maximising value extraction by virtue of putting people into that subjective position. Mark Zuckerberg, well, I would probably say, yes. He doesn't strike me as a very happy sort of guy. And I feel that it's an empty sort of system. There's ultimately no reward at the top. You don't get the good life by being at the top of the pile. There's no escape. So yeah, that would be my answer. This reminds me of an interesting moment, actually, during the run up to the election where there was a Question Time where a man got up in the audience and said, "You said you were going to tax people who earn more than &pound;80,000, I earn more than &pound;80,000, and my life is awful, I'm really stressed, it's really difficult. You can't take that money from me." And lots of people were outraged by that. But it was just really interesting to see that earning a lot of money doesn't make you happy, doesn't somehow reward you - that doesn't get you out of the stresses of this total all-encompassing system of value extraction. And, again, it also speaks to that idea of over employment, those who make very much money, while they do exploit the rest of us, they nonetheless, also often do work insane hours, not in a way that's virtuous. It's stupid. It's not virtuous, but it is part of the system.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And you've talked about the damaging effects of the internet, for example, eroding the work life balance, but you're not wholly pessimistic about the internet. For example, you mentioned that it's often where progressive activist networks are built. Are there ways in which the internet can help us make change in the world of work?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>I think, and I'm probably slightly more pessimistic about this now than I was when we were writing the book, but nonetheless, roughly basically the same position. I think that the internet as it is right now is a very bad and very damaging place because of the way that those platforms work. Now, people do find ways around that. But those ways are very limited. I mean, it is interesting to see, of course how, in recent years, we've been engulfed by culture wars online, which very often seem to be focused around proxy battles and proxy wars that really don't get to the material basis of the situation that we're in. And so I think, absolutely that, yes, it's not the answer to go offline completely, or to get rid of the internet, I think we will need to change it. And I think we will be able to do that. But we can only do that when we have a public internet, we can't improve the way in which we are living our social lives online, and the way in which as you say, we organise, and the way in which activists try and work against it online, if we don't also fight for different kind of internet. And different people have various ideas about quite how a public internet might look and how we might be able to bring it about. I don't know, exactly, but I definitely am convinced that people are beginning to think about that. I think that is the direction that we need to go in.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Interesting. So we've talked about the very serious struggles that are faced by the mal-employed and the dis-employed. And the less tangible but equally real and pressing issues around the digital labour of life online. So considering all of that, how could a post work world that tackles all of this actually be structured? And how could it come about? Sorry, a big question to end on.</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>It is a big question. Well, in terms of how it could or should be structured, I guess, one thing that we were trying to point towards and that we were interested in is that if we're gonna have a utopian new world of work, then we would have to find ways for people to have room to determine themselves that aren't predetermined as it were. There's going to be some room to work it out as we go along. I mean, what are the options? So far, we've had ideas of more or less bourgeois self improvement - working your allotment, learning instruments, that sort of thing in your free time. I guess there's the psychoanalytic idea of self-determination, of just following your desire, then there's the question of well, how do we actually organise the work that needs to be done? How is that going to work? Is it some sort of idea of an altruistic service to others, service to the community? I guess, basically, our ideas aren't going that far beyond basic Marxist ideas, which are that you share out the work that actually needs to be done in as fair a way as possible. You make sure that everybody has the things that they need and as fast as possible, and you make room for there to be some free time, some actual free time. And then I guess we're we're interested in the political potential of that free time, a real free time to change the shape of the whole thing, because it's out of that time for art out of that time for creativity, that new thought and new AI, even new new desires can come out of which there isn't really room for right now. And how can we get that? Well, I mean, it's impossible really to talk about these things without talking about politics. And not so long ago, it seemed like Britain was the one country in Europe, which had a plausible left program. And that didn't get anywhere. So this is this is a very bleak moment politically. So if you still believe in social democracy, if you still believe in the, in the political system that we've got so far, then it's probably a very grim hard slog involving things like organising in the workplace, finding a kind of new process of unionisation, and of political education, which helps people to rediscover how they can support each other to make their work more like the kind of work that everybody in a particular workplace wants it to be like. But yeah, that's a painful and slow process and nothing like an instant utopia.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>So now it's time to turn to the <em>New Humanist</em> archive for a piece that resonates with what we've been discussing today. So Mareila, we thought we'd look at a piece that Niki wrote in 2019, called 'Fighting for the Future'. Her piece takes in books about work in the future by Sophie Lewis, Aaron Bastani and Paul Mason. In the piece, Niki writes that traditionally its left wing and radical anti-establishment thinkers that have taken it upon themselves to imagine new worlds and utopias in turbulent times. So one thing that your book does is talk about the pitfalls of attempting to envision a post work future. Could you tell us a bit about what those pitfalls are and how one could avoid them?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>I guess, one of the pitfalls is that we tend to take for granted that in the future, we will want the things that we want right now. But of course, the things that we want right now are profoundly shaped by our own cultural moment, our own subjectivities and our outlook. So I guess the thing to be mindful of when thinking about a future utopia is how there can be room in it for desires, for ideas that we can't even envisage from the limited horizon of our own moment, at the same time. The other problem is that, of course, and Kate Soper talks about this, interestingly, in 2000, when she's talking about this idea of post consumerist life, when she says that, of course, when revolutionaries do envisage the future, they also have to take into account the things that we desire at this very moment. Otherwise, people won't want it. So it's the balance between those two things. That's that's the trouble, the tricky bit.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Oone of the big changes that might occur is automation on a mass scale, both Bastani and Mason in their books saw that as a big change that's coming. Where do you stand on this? Is it something to fear? Or could it actually be freeing?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>I guess in Bastani's version, it could potentially be freeing. And I think there certainly is room to think with, rather than against automation. And, I guess the ideas of the Green Industrial Revolution would would sort of take that into account. In Mason's book, of course, automation is a bit scarier, where there's this idea of the machines taking over. I'm very suspicious of that as an idea. I think it's a fake problem. I don't think we need to worry about the machines taking over tomorrow. I don't think it's going to be Frankenstein. I think the real question is simply who is in control of the technologies and who, you know, automation for whom, to what end? And with what results? I don't think that technologies are necessarily neutral. I can't think of a great way to repurpose, say, the weapon industry. But I do think that quite a lot of the technologies that we have, if we repurpose them into a different direction, we can all benefit from them. And automation, I think can be a case in point.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And I also discuss Sophie Lewis and her book, <em>Full Surrogacy Now</em> in the piece. So that book explores the possibilities of new technologies to create more options for having and raising kids. So it's a work of cyber feminism. And I just wondered, would you say that you share common ground with Sophie Lewis and her work?</p> <p><strong>MP: </strong></p> <p>Yes, sure. I think what I appreciate about Sophie's work is something quite specific and quite specifically to do with the question of technology. So when she takes this idea of surrogacy, you know, something that we might describe as the absolute apotheosis of alienated women's work under neoliberal capitalism, to literally put your womb to work, to reproduce for rich people - to take that and instead of jumping to conclusions about the wickedness of this, as lots of campaigners have done, to try and hold on to the surrogacy as an idea, and to ask what would happen if we stripped out the exploitative capitalist conditions under which it's currently being used altogether and imagine what surrogacy could be like in a different world, where it just simply might be a very good way of sharing our body's ability to make new humans in it, perhaps a generous, and a different way that might ultimately lead to a different shape of society altogether. What I appreciate about that is the way in which technology is looked at as something that needs to be separated from the political uses to which it's being put, and then there is room for us to change it - and there's no point in vilifying it as itself. I guess if you know some of the post structuralist thinkers that the James and I talk about in the book, like Derrida talk about the idea that technology really part of human life, if language is technology, if clothing is technology, if all of our buildings and infrastructures are technology and obviously the internet etc, ICT technologies as well, then it's really just a question about what we do with them and how we use them to better the social fabric of our lives and our work lives, rather than something that is an object that can be good or evil as such.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Mariele Pfannebecker, co-author of <em>Work Want Work</em>, concluding they're on the peril and promise of technology. So Samira, what will you take away from today?</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>One of the things that I really liked was this definition of malemployment, I think it's really useful to bring together both things, the idea of people with too much to do, and people with too little to do. Because I think often you don't think of those as being part and parcel of the same picture, which is a dysfunctional relationship to work more broadly. And I don't know about you, but I've definitely had both experiences, being quite junior and basically not having anything to do, but still having to be in your miserable job all the time. And that's a horrible experience. And it's equally horrible, being completely overloaded and just feeling like there aren't enough hours in the day. So yeah, I thought that was really fascinating. And despite the fact that thatbrings together so many people at both ends of the spectrum, we still continue to define ourselves by work, which is this not necessarily very happy thing.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>It's also that experience that you get when you're just hustling. I mean, whether you're a freelancer or you work in the gig economy, you might not have work, but you're spending every waking hour of your life just looking for work, which is obviously incredibly demoralising, but keeps you in that mindset.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, absolutely. I think that idea that we can't really switch off was also quite present in our discussion about furlough. And the way that so many people had this block of time off, probably the first time ever, but ended up grimly trying to improve themselves, to do something that was productive. So she talked about the sourdough baking, which became a bit of a trope, but you know, feeling like you have to be learning a language or you have to be learning to bake this complicated bread or whatever - it doesn't feel valid to just sit and read a book, because you've suddenly got this time off that's effectively paid. And obviously, there's a whole load of other considerations such as, you know, general anxiety that the pandemic brought, and people's worried that they might not have a job to go back to. But I do think there's something about that, that really kind of crystallises something about how we're so defined by this anxious workscape that we just can't conceive of ourselves without work at all.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, and just anecdotally, it seemed that a lot of people were struggling with not being sucked into the online world, especially in lockdown where there didn't seem to be anything else to do or you couldn't leave your home. And that sense of lost time. And I guess Mareile also discusses that in her book, that notion that while you may feel like you're not working, digital labour can be work. And that question of actually, who profits from that?</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, totally. I think that the idea of digital labour is super interesting, because there's the double facet on the one level, the way that our activity online is literally doing free work for companies who profit off our data. And also this constant work we do around personal branding in the way we're projected to the world. I found it interesting how she talked about influencers and the way that their monetisation of their own lives and the totality of themselves, in a way is not just a unique set of traits to influencers, but it maybe tells us something more generally about how all of us act online and how all of us feel the need to present ourselves and monetise parts of ourselves and our lives that in bygone eras may have been more private.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, it's really interesting and just so complex. So that's it for now, and I hope it wasn't too much hard work. Next week, we'll be talking about music, race and identity when we meet the sociologist Jason Arday, who had written about cool Britannia and its blind spots.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Remember, you can find reading lists and transcripts for all episodes of <em>With Reason</em>, at newhumanist.org.uk.

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Liverpool demo following Margaret Thatcher's death, 2013. Image: Flickr / Radarsmum67" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/8659276766_b44d36b239_o.jpg" height="418" alt="8659276766_b44d36b239_o" width="616" /></p> <p class="p1">The political landscape in Britain is becoming more toxic by the day. Or so it can seem, with ordinary people increasingly identifying themselves by their tribes &ndash; left/right, Labour/Tory, Leave/Remain &ndash; while these very labels are often used as slurs by the other side. Divisive politicians and angry commentators pander to our biases, creating a culture of contempt, through what social scientist Arthur Brooks has called the &ldquo;Outrage Industrial Complex&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">But is this antagonism equally fierce on either side? Evidence is emerging of an intriguing asymmetry between how the left and right view each other on an interpersonal level, with the left apparently proving most hostile. Last year, a YouGov survey found that 34 per cent of Labour supporters would be upset if their child married a Conservative, whereas only 13 per cent of Conservatives would be upset with a Labour in-law.</p> <p class="p3">Furthermore, a Hostility Barometer survey conducted by LSE found that 68 per cent of Labour voters felt disgust towards Conservative voters, while 48 per cent of Conservatives felt the same way about Labour voters. A quarter of Labour voters said they wouldn&rsquo;t invite a Conservative voter for dinner, compared to 16 per cent of Conservatives.</p> <p class="p3">What&rsquo;s driving the asymmetry in those numbers? Is this an empathy blind spot, or do the right offend the core values of left-wing voters more deeply than vice versa? Are the left more emotional about their politics?</p> <p class="p3">Back in 2013, when he was still London mayor, Boris Johnson wrote: &ldquo;On the whole, right-wingers are prepared to indulge left-wingers on the grounds that they may be wrong and misguided but are still perfectly nice. Lefties, on the other hand, are much more likely to think right-wingers are genuinely evil.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">The idea of the &ldquo;intolerant left&rdquo; is so often voiced by right-wingers that it has become a trope &ndash; but let&rsquo;s put the messenger aside and consider the message. Within my own social circle, it certainly seems that those on the left think those on the right are &ldquo;worse people&rdquo;. Not evil necessarily, but morally inferior. Less caring, less compassionate, less concerned about the suffering of others and therefore more selfish and more cruel.</p> <p class="p3">Moral and political psychologist Cory Clark says there is little consensus on the psychological differences between those on the left and the right: &ldquo;My personal assessment is that they are probably quite similar &ndash; and dislike one another to similar degrees &ndash; though there are very small differences that seem real and replicable.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">To better understand these differences, let&rsquo;s consider another asymmetry &ndash; between a vegetarian and a meat eater. On the one hand, these are dietary choices, two sides of the same coin. But they&rsquo;re not equivalent. The meat eater could have the vegetarian&rsquo;s dish (even if he might not enjoy it so much) but the vegetarian wouldn&rsquo;t eat the meat eater&rsquo;s dish, because their diet is defined by their opposition to meat. In fact, when they look at the meat, they are likely to perceive harm &ndash; whether that be the suffering of the butchered animal or the environmental impacts of the diet. The meat eater might judge the vegetarian&rsquo;s choice as foolish or impoverished or virtue-signalling, but they are less likely to see harm and to make a moral judgment.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">In his book <em>The Righteous Mind</em>, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that the left (&ldquo;liberals&rdquo; in the US parlance) build their morality on a smaller number of moral foundations. While left-wingers are primarily concerned about care and fairness, the right tend to be motivated by a wider range of ethical considerations, including care and fairness, but also liberty, loyalty, authority and sanctity. He says that the left score higher on questions of care and harm, like &ldquo;how much would someone have to pay you to kick a dog in the head?&rdquo; Nobody wants to cause pain to an innocent creature, but Haidt found that conservatives would have to be paid less. Meanwhile, the right score higher on loyalty to their country and respect for authority. They&rsquo;d be less willing to badmouth their nation on a foreign radio station or stick their finger up at their boss.</p> <p class="p3">In 2012, Haidt led a study to test how well Americans understood each other. More than 2,000 participants answered various moral questions, either as themselves or imagining how others on their own side, or their political opponents, would answer. Haidt writes:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p6">The results were clear and consistent. Moderates and conservatives were most accurate in their predictions. Liberals were the least accurate, especially those who described themselves as &ldquo;very liberal&rdquo;. The biggest errors in the whole study came when liberals answered the Care and Fairness questions while pretending to be conservatives. When faced with questions such as &ldquo;One of the worst things a person could do is hurt a defenceless animal&rdquo;, liberals assumed that conservatives would disagree.</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">What Haidt found was that liberals don&rsquo;t understand conservatives as well as conservatives understand liberals. Could this explain why left-wingers in Britain are less inclined to invite a Tory to dinner? As Haidt writes:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p6">The obstacles to empathy are not symmetrical. If the left builds its moral matrices on a smaller number of moral foundations, then there is no foundation used by the left that is not also used by the right. Even though conservatives score slightly lower on measures of empathy and may therefore be less moved by a story about suffering and oppression, they can still recognise that it is awful to be kept in chains.</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">One critic of Haidt&rsquo;s moral foundations theory is psychology professor Kurt Gray, who believes that &ldquo;harm&rdquo; is the key consideration for moral judgements across the spectrum of political thought. Taking that idea, it&rsquo;s worth considering which side may perceive more harm in the policies of the other.</p> <p class="p2">Our morality also influences who we feel we are compatible with. In the most personal realm of dating, indicators suggest once again that the left takes political views more to heart. The same YouGov poll found that 28 per cent of Labour voters would not date a Conservative, while 17 per cent of Conservatives would rule out a Labour supporter.</p> <p class="p3">Dating apps like Hinge and OkCupid allow users to filter out people with opposing political views. While there is no clear data available on which demographic is more likely to use this function, the phrase &ldquo;never kissed a Tory&rdquo; is such a common brag that it&rsquo;s become a slogan printed on T-shirts and mugs. Meanwhile, the term &ldquo;woke-fishing&rdquo; has recently emerged, with a spate of articles describing the supposed phenomenon of men pretending to be more politically progressive as a seduction technique. A friend of mine recently tweeted her advice to exclusively sleep with socialists &ldquo;because the politics of selfishism do not make for a satisfactory shag.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">I contacted another friend who swears she would &ldquo;never kiss a Tory&rdquo; and asked her to explain her disdain. She believes most Tories to be &ldquo;greedy and selfish&rdquo;, telling me, &ldquo;The right covets wealth and individualism more. There must be something in the Bible about all of that though. Isn&rsquo;t it one of the seven deadly sins? To covet? Or to be greedy? . . . people know this is instinctively wrong. Some choose to ignore it. Some accept it and feel bad. Some don&rsquo;t care. But I believe that everyone, instinctively, knows this is the wrong way to conduct your life.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">The religiosity of this language is interesting because several commentators have pointed to the declining role of religion as contributing to our increasing political polarisation. As Conservatism in Britain has become less linked with the Church, perhaps it&rsquo;s lost a moral force which once helped to counterbalance its devotion to free markets. Similarly, the retreat of religion might have made belonging to the left a replacement faith for many.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5"><em>Guardian</em> journalist Lucy Mangan married a Conservative and has written humorously about her relationship with &ldquo;Tory Boy&rdquo;. I was curious to know how they&rsquo;d conquered the political divide. They&rsquo;d met at a book launch in their 30s. Tory Boy approached Mangan. The revelation of their political differences came after they&rsquo;d been dating for a few months.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;I burst into tears the first time he said he was a Tory and a Thatcherite&rdquo;, she told me. &ldquo;I can still remember the moment. We were on Beckenham High Street. I think the strength of my feeling probably surprised him.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Mangan had been raised by parents working in the arts and the NHS, who switched off the television if Margaret Thatcher appeared. So how did she overcome her horror?</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Love the sinner, hate the sin. I said to myself, okay, I&rsquo;ve believed this thing all my life and now I&rsquo;ve met this person who I like and understand and am starting to love, so something has to shift. If this is just the tip of an evil iceberg then we&rsquo;ll have to call it off, but maybe there will be more to it &ndash; and of course I discovered that to be a Tory is not to be one thing.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Being part of a mixed-political couple has made Mangan realise that people are far more tribal than she&rsquo;d ever expected. Early in the relationship, one of her <em>Guardian</em> colleagues confided that they couldn&rsquo;t imagine going out with someone who wasn&rsquo;t a member of the liberal left. Mangan was perplexed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Tory Boy often says, there&rsquo;s nothing more rigid than the liberal orthodoxy.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Last year the National Theatre staged Simon Woods&rsquo; play <em>Hansard</em>, set in 1988, which depicts a Conservative MP arguing with his left-wing wife. Their political conversation is intensely emotional, exposing differences between their worldviews and inner lives. When the wife suggests the cabinet might want to try a trip to the theatre, her husband erupts: &ldquo;You think your culture makes people empathetic, don&rsquo;t you? Open-minded. But let me tell you, there is no group of people more narrow-minded than you book readers. Your theatregoers. Appalling people. You try being a member of Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s government and standing in the foyer of a theatre. If you want to talk about prejudice. If you want to talk about a lack of empathy.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">It may seem ironic that the apparently more empathetic left seem to have hearts of steel when it comes to their political enemies. But as Cory Clark explains, while left-wingers score higher on empathy, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;mainly or perhaps only for relatively low-status groups. I suspect the reverse is true for higher status groups and they would not have particular empathy for conservatives.&rdquo; She says those on the left tend to &ldquo;perceive women, black people and Muslims as victims and thus they are inclined to treat such groups better than they treat higher status groups. They have a bias in favour of groups they perceive as low status. Conservatives distinguish less by social status and treat groups of higher and lower status more similarly.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Ed West has written a book addressing his life-long obsession with being a minority conservative in a mostly progressive social milieu. <em>Small Men on the Wrong Side of History</em> expresses his belief, as a young Tory, that he was an anomaly, someone who had developed conservative traits earlier than normal. He assumed that &ldquo;like baldness or impotence or the other bad things that people get in middle age&rdquo;, his friends and acquaintances would catch up with his conservatism at some point because &ldquo;these things just develop at different speeds&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">However, knocking on his 40th birthday, he realised that he was still in the minority amongst his peers, and his Crouch End neighbours, if anything, were drifting further to the left. Even in the 2019 election, which won Boris Johnson a mighty majority, the Tories lost heavily among all age groups under 44. He told me that part of his motivation for writing the book &ldquo;was trying to convince people that I&rsquo;m not actually evil.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">He doesn&rsquo;t always convince. In one anecdote, he describes going out to dinner with fellow <em>Telegraph</em> bloggers James Delingpole, Douglas Murray and Norman Tebbit, &ldquo;the very man who said &lsquo;get on your bike&rsquo; to the unemployed&rdquo;. They were in an exclusive West End gentleman&rsquo;s club, eating foie gras (&ldquo;the cruelest form of food available&rdquo;), and West felt tempted to toast, &ldquo;Gentleman, to evil&rdquo; but he wasn&rsquo;t sure Lord Tebbit would get the <em>Simpsons</em> reference. In moments like that, does he wonder if he is indeed one of the bad guys? &ldquo;Oh yes, definitely.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">West highlights the fact that whilst the Tories have political power as the party of government, they are losing cultural power, with the tech industry, universities and schools overwhelmingly dominated by progressives. One of West&rsquo;s theories for why conservatives might be better able to understand lefties, as in the Haidt experiment, is because Conservatives &ldquo;will certainly absorb more progressive television and cinema; not because we&rsquo;re more open-minded (by nature we&rsquo;re not) but because those are the prevailing cultural noises and so we have no choice, just as any minority has more awareness of and interaction with the majority.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Talking over Zoom, he acknowledges his own role in feeding the Outrage Industrial Complex. He&rsquo;d listen to Radio 4 or read the <em>Guardian</em>, get riled up and rant about &ldquo;leftists&rdquo; for the <em>Telegraph</em>. His book strikes a more magnanimous tone, and separates his inflammatory professional rhetoric from his personal relationships. He describes sitting in hospital, watching his two-year-old son drawing oxygen from a mask whilst fighting pneumonia, relieved that his daughters are being looked after by good friends who happen to be &ldquo;solid Labour members and activists who used to knock on doors for their party and have all the social values of the progressive left. They are very good people. I&rsquo;d trust them to look after my children if we ever died in a plane crash.&rdquo; He laments the fact that the outrage machine &ldquo;is dividing thousands of similarly good people in a completely needless way.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">He has some cautionary words for the left: &ldquo;What is most troubling about the progressive religion is the assumption by some on the left that their side is moral, whereas genuinely moral people should never be comfortable in their righteousness.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">In 1948, on the eve of the creation of the NHS, Labour&rsquo;s Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan made a speech which claimed Great Britain now had the &ldquo;moral leadership of the world&rdquo;. In this very same speech he declared his &ldquo;deep burning hatred for the Tory party&rdquo;, calling them &ldquo;lower than vermin&rdquo;. His dehumanising language became an icon of tribal politics, in turns celebrated and criticised by his own side. Haidt argues that the left&rsquo;s lack of understanding of conservatives leads to a conservative advantage at the polls. Rather than stoking contempt, the more productive road might be to grow our curiosity about the moral motivations of political opponents.</p> <p class="p3">We could start by inviting them to dinner. Perhaps there are no nasty parties or inherently nasty people. And if we think there are, maybe the problem is us.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2020 edition. </em><em><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

In this series, we're meeting writers and academics whose work prompts questions like: How should we listen to people whose worldview we disagree with? What risk is there in sticking to narrow ideas of knowledge? And how are our relationships with our work and with each other, being changed by technology? Our guest this series include people like Kate Devlin, an expert in social and cultural intelligence, talking about the future of intimacy and tech. And next week, we'll hear from Mareile Pfannebecker on the subject of work and desire in late capitalism. But right now, we're meeting a feminist author and journalist who's challenging mainstream notions of knowledge.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Today, we're talking to Minna Salami. She is the woman behind the Ms. Afropolitan blog, a really successful blog that connects feminism with reflections on contemporary culture, from an Africa-centered perspective, and she is also the author of <em>Sensuous Knowledge: A Black Feminist Approach for Everyone</em>. In that book, she challenges the types of knowing that we've really taken for granted for way too long, and she offers a more inclusive, more holistic way of thinking about knowledge. I would say it's a book that speaks pretty strongly to questions of reason and unreason today. And in particular Minna exposes what she calls Europatriarchal knowledge. So we started by asking her exactly what that means.</p> <p><strong>Minna Salami: </strong></p> <p>The point of Europatriarchal knowledge is not so much that it is marked by Eurocentricity and by male dominance, but rather that it is a fragmented and polarizing, divisive worldview. And so it started in during the Age of Discovery, when European monarchs sent off explorers into parts of the world that were previously thought of as the unknown. And prior to that, so in medieval times, even in Europe, knowledge had been seen as something to preserve, so something that everybody had an investment in. And then during this period of discovery, knowledge became something to acquire instead of something to preserve. And you had Francis Bacon, who was really influential in shaping this new perception of knowledge. And so he coined this adage, knowledge is power, which today is used more positively, I would argue than than what he did. So what Bacon meant in his tractate Novum Organum, which he wrote in 1620, by "knowledge is power", was that the more knowledge we could acquire about nature and about all of these parts of the world that previously were thought of as unknown, the more power we would have, and, and so literally, it was sort of classifying nature as something to exploit, dominate and control. And then included in this perception of nature over time where women, you know, indigenous peoples, so basically, everything and everyone that wasn't the Eurocentric elite, or elite men who were shaping this, this worldview.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>So Minna, I guess when you talk about Europatriarchal knowledge we're talking about knowledge as something that can be acquired, that can be used to dominate other people, that kind of thing - that can be measured, that leads to ranking, calculation, all of that. You suggest that Europatriarchal knowledge shapes things like politics and education to this day, and that its dominance means that we failed to address various social problems as well as we otherwise might be able to. I think you say the poorest in society often pay for this. Can you can you give any examples of the damage done today by that kind of thinking?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Yes, so Europatriarchal knowledge is a worldview that sees fragmentation, polarization and division at the heart of it, we see the same pattern, the same kind of system of fragmentation in all parts of society and all institutions. And in order to uphold the fragmentative, and divisive thought, we kind of have to use a mechanistic method, because anything that is holistic, anything that speaks to the unity that ultimately exists between human beings of different races and genders or between the non-human natural world and human beings will destroy this system of thought. And so we find this replicated from a very early age in our educational systems, where children are taught to rank each other, to be competitive, to think of what they are learning as fragmented systems. So we think, you know, there's no connection between the arts and the sciences, for example, and that humans and nature are divided. And in contemporary society, because we are educated in this way, we continue to replicate this in our forms of thinking. And so when you look at the types of institutions that govern the lives of the most disenfranchised, there is this neglect of wholeness, where basically divide between what I would label the aesthetic and the mystical, so things like embodiment, and the arts and myth and lived experience, basically. And then on the other hand, we have what I would label the the political and demystifying. So science, critical analysis, reasoning, rational thinking. We are educated to believe that we're not allowed even to bring these two together. And whatever kind of oppressive structure or system we are looking at, you tend to find this at the very heart of the matter.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And when you talk about the Europatriarchal view, you're not seeking to simply overthrow or battle with it, are you? It's something more complex.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Exactly. So first of all, when I speak about Europatriarchal knowledge, I'm not speaking about white men, per se. So just because somebody is a white male does not mean that they automatically perpetuate Europatriarchal knowledge. You know, Europatriarchal knowledge goes back centuries. And there have always been people even within this system, this worldview, who have opposed it, many of whom have been white people, or male people or white male people. And the other reason that I'm not seeking to sort of overthrow Europatriarchal knowledge as my main focus is because whatever you resist, whatever you're protesting against, is what you centre at the end of the day. So my interest in engaging with Europatriarchal knowledge, is to critique it for one, but more importantly, is to expose it because once people see the flaws in something, it has less power over them.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And you talk about the holes, the gaps in Europatriarchal knowledge, one thing that you do to illustrate the idea of a more nuanced approach to knowledge and how that could be helpful is you tell the story of Yoruba city of Ife in southwestern Nigeria, Could you just tell that story for us briefly and and what its message is for you?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Ife is the city that lies at the cradle of Yoruba civilization, Yoruba civilization, for those who don't know consists of millions of people around the world who are of Yoruba descent. So it's not like a small village or tribe or anything like that. So Ife is a major city, and it's also the city from which the Yoruba philosophy and mythology emanates. And so when it comes to knowledge, the ancient myths have this story that the gods gave people something called ogbon. Ogbon could be translated to knowledge, but more precisely, it is the ancient Greek term for anasis, which means practical wisdom. And when when the gods gave the people of effect of ogbon, they understood that it had to speak to the hearts and the minds of the people of Ife. And so they split up Ogbon into what they called ogbon-ori, which basically means, literally translated means "knowledge of the head", and ogbon-inu which literally translates as "knowledge of the gods". So you could say these are respectively, intellectual and emotional intelligence, and according to the Yoruba epos, to only have one type of ogbon, one type of knowledge, was to be only partly wise. The reason that I share this this ancient myth is to argue that what Europatriarchal knowledge, this dominant system that we now have does, is to only focus on ogbon-ori, knowledge of the head, so to speak, and furthermore, it does so in ways that creates this hierarchy and ranking, and says that ogbon-ori, knowledge of the head is better than knowledge of the gods. Whereas the two are parts of the same coin. Is this something that needs to be recognized for the benefit of everyone? So you write about the harm that's done by Europatriarchal knowledge not just to women, but also to men. Absolutely, it is something that needs to be recognized by everyone, because ultimately, we're all made up of the same kinds of interiorities, as human beings, we're all driven by our fears and our desires. And, you know, society is a relational phenomena, you could actually say that the male gender, in some specific ways, suffers even more from Europatriarchal knowledge, being a worldview that does this fragmenting, dividing thing. And because of its association with male dominance, it means that men are even more prone to internalize separative way of looking at things. And so men are especially socialized to repress and neglect the emotional and the embodied side of life and of knowledge production. And this kind of repression leads to violence, whether it's a kind of emotional violence or violence toward oneself in terms of denying and suppressing your desires, or violence towards others, which is the worst outcome, which we see manifest in our societies, in so many different ways.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>So Minna, you put forward this term sensuous knowledge, I guess, offering a more holistic idea of what knowledge could be, that's not so one dimensional, as Europatriarchal knowledge is. Tell me a bit about that, and how that came about.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Sensuous knowledge is an approach to knowledge in which I synthesize rational thinking with emotional intelligence. And the way that I figure one can do that - because, of course, it's not as straightforward as it sounds, when you when you put it that way- it is by combining what I labeled the mystical and the aesthetic. So things like art, personal narrative, and spirituality, and poetry also, you could add to that with things that are deemed to be strictly political. So you know, your activism, your analyses, theory and so on. So bringing this kind of interweaving approach. The reason that I do that is, so that whatever kind of liberation and empowerment that knowledge can provide us is coming from a genuinely holistic place, which means that it will be more lasting than anything, which is a kind of cosmetic effort and a patchy effort towards liberation and empowerment.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And so just to clarify, I guess sensuous knowledge, we're talking about a form of knowledge, which also incorporates the bodily, the sensuous not the sensual, and ideas beyond the intellectual and cerebral alone, I suppose. Give me an example of this. So what would happen if we applied sensuous knowledge to say, economic exchanges? I think you're talking about ideas of reciprocity, exchange, eroticism, even but not as we know it in the sexual sense.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>As you said, the word sensuous is not quite the same as the word sensual. So it's sensual, obviously has to do with the senses. And furthermore, it has to do with the bodily pleasures that we can get from our senses. Whereas the word sensuous, it means an integration of the mind, body and soul. But all that said, I'm not denying the bodily pleasures, or any kind of erotic side to sensuousness. Because since the word sensuous is an integration of the whole of the body, as well as the mind, as well as the spirit, it also includes the erotic, by which I mean, the word erotic as connected to Eros, which in ancient Greek means love, which speaks to this kind of relational element of humanity. I'm quite fascinated in my book in looking at what it would mean and what it does to our institutions and our conceptualizations when we eroticized them. So you asked, if we were to look at the economy more erotically, more sensuously, more relationally, what would it look like and and I think it would be shaped more by values like reciprocity and connectedness. Whereas at the moment, our economies are obviously very much shaped by division and competition, which creates more suffering.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>In championing sensuous knowledge, you uphold the value of that which we might typically label as feminine. So the instinctive, the bodily associations with nature, rivers, all of these kind of things. How do you tread the line between doing that whilst also being careful at the same time, to not essentialise womanhood, to say there are qualities that are essentially female and feminine. And I think for example, you do quote Simone de Beauvoir, on a person not being born a woman, but becoming one, yet at the same time, you uphold feminine values. Tell me about that striking that balance?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>So, because we have lived in systems and because we've received educations that devalue what we could call the feminine, you know, it becomes important to look at what those values can contribute to our world today. But you know, that these are ultimately just words, that they construct the idea of the feminine, the idea of womanhood or construct, but they are constructs that are also real. So, when you are born female, when you are deemed to be born female, then you are going to, in all likelihood, receive a cultural education that is centering around the idea of you being feminine. But that is simultaneously also devaluing whatever is imbued in the idea of you being feminine. So, yes, sensuous knowledge is certainly not about essentialising femininity or sensuousness even or anything like that. But rather, it is refusing to be silent about, you know, the devaluing of these things, and also to just look at all of the different elements of what shapes collective consciousness and knowledge.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>You're listening to <em>With Reason</em> from <em>New Humanist</em> magazine and the Rationalist Association with me Alice Bloch -</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And me Samira Shackle. And today we're joined by Minna Salami, who's talking about her book <em>Sensuous Knowledge</em>. If you're enjoying this episode, please take 20 seconds now to pause it and tweet about it tagging in @newhumanist, or share a link on Facebook. The more listeners we have, the more episodes we can make. Thanks for your support.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>So far, we've talked about why Europatriarchal knowledge needs to be called out. And we've heard about how what Minna calls sensuous knowledge, if applied to the economy, for example, could reap all sorts of rewards, nurturing a culture of reciprocity. Coming up, we'll talk about sisterhood, decolonization, and Minna takes a look at a <em>New Humanist</em> article on the African American thinker, W. E. B. Du Bois. But first, back to Minna, describing the biography behind her writing.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>I was actually born in Finland, but moved to Nigeria as a baby. And then to Sweden as a teenager. From Sweden, I moved to New York and then to London, where I now still am, for the most part. And yes, I think that having so many different backgrounds and the identities that come along with such backgrounds, it hasn't always been easy to to unite these different elements of my of my unique experience. But ultimately, you know, certainly now it feels like an advantage because I'm able to look at issues with multiple lenses.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And Minna, you use the term "writer's grievance". What do you mean by that? I think you draw on the African American thinker and activist W. E. B. Du Bois and his ideas about double consciousness.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>W. E. B. Du Bois, when he coined double consciousness, what he meant is that you that you other yourself, because you're constantly looking at yourself with perceptions that have been formulated by another group of people. And furthermore, they have formulated these perceptions with a contempt and a pity towards you. And so I compare writer's grievance to double consciousness and basically what I mean by writer's grievance is this sense that I have when I'm writing, in which I am aware of an almost howling rage, with the oppressive, dominant stories about women, about people of colour and so on. And then a simultaneous frustration that you can't just write about something mundane and trivial in the way that a white male author might be able to. And so that's what I mean by writer's grievance, which is something that I experience to a far greater extent than, you know, than writer's block, for instance, which is what writers allegedly experience.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And another thing that you talk about is the importance of decolonizing the mind. Could you explain that a little bit?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, so we typically think of decolonizing the mind as though the prefix "de", like to decolonize is almost thought of as if we could amputate thoughts and just remove whatever patterns of thinking are no longer working in our societies. But decolonizing the mind doesn't work like that at all. And if anything, that just makes us paranoid and almost neurotic, because, you know, it's almost like we start to think that we can just swallow a decolonization pill and wake up the next day with decolonized minds, and then we start to compete with others and think, "Oh, is this person more decolonized than I am", and so on and so forth. And rather, decolonizing the mind is something that speaks to coming to see, and consciousness as a whole. I compare decolonizing the mind to a garden, where we might think of it, or today, the way we think of it is to do away with any plants that we find ugly. Whereas decolonizing, the mind is actually seeing if some kind of hybrid plant grows out of what already exists in the garden, it is planting new seeds that can then flourish.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And how do those ideas around decolonization relate to something like removing statues, which we've seen this year in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter protests? So do you think physical change, like the removing of a physical monument, like a statue is useful if it's not accompanied by this kind of mental process or an educational one, perhaps?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>So I think that I certainly see the symbolic value in in some of the statue removals that took place this year. But yes, I think without a change of mindset, I'm concerned that it just becomes a symbolic exercise with little lasting effect.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Minna, I want to jump forward to this subject of sisterhood that you talk about. Also, I think you mentioned it's a bit of an unfashionable concept at the moment, I feel that's something instinctively I would agree with, but what do you mean by that? And why is sisterhood nonetheless important to you? In talking about this, I think you mentioned the feminist theorists, bell hooks, but you also mentioned an uncomfortable exchange you had with a woman in a London bookshop at an event.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, so the first thing to say is that I'm speaking about political sisterhood, rather than a kind of sisterhood, where, you know, everybody's holding hands and getting along, that is not the case, and doesn't have to be the case at all. So, you know, we think of feminism as a fight against patriarchy, which it is, but it is also a fight for this type of political sisterhood. Because, you know, put it this way, if acid rain falls over forests, it might not kill every tree, but it affects every tree, negatively. And patriarchy affects every woman negatively, even if it does so in varying degrees. And so if we're not looking to do away with the acid, or with patriarchy, in this case, then you know, we're all going to be impacted adversely.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And so this this bookshop incident, it was where a woman suggested to you that she thought personally, it wasn't best practice to collaborate or cooperate with white feminists and you disagreed with her.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>I did a talk at a bookshop in London, during which I mentioned that I thought we should have political sisterhood between women. And afterwards an audience member said to me that she disagreed, and she thought that as a black woman, we shouldn't collaborate with white women because white women don't have black women's interests at heart. And, you know, it's hard to summarize, because this is a very complex conversation between two black women that come from different backgrounds. But, you know, I thought about this a lot. And I mean, I thought about this conversation between her and I, and I ultimately disagree, because, you know, we have to figure out ways of coexisting. Even if we as black women were to do away with racism, we would still as women be severely detrimentally impacted by patriarchy. And just like we need to fight against racism together with black men, we also need to fight against sexism together with white women.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Minna, there are vast inequalities within that sisterhood. You write about how black women's contribution to the feminist movement throughout history, in fact, throughout all the different waves has been under appreciated, there's been little return on investment is how you put it.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Yes, when we look at feminism in waves, so that is like the first wave, second wave, third wave and so on, each of these waves has been largely, if not designed, then, you know, shaped by black feminists - from the first wave where you had women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton who popularized the movement was actually very much impacted by black women like Ida B wells. And then you have the second wave in the 1960s, which was a direct result of the civil rights movement. And very much borrowed ideas from the civil rights movement as well as Third World liberation movements. Third wave of feminism was actually coined by Rebecca Walker, a black woman, and shaped by notions such as intersectionality, coined by a black woman, and the fourth wave that we're now in, we have movements like #MeToo which was started by Tarana Burke, a black woman. You have some of the most influential feminist icons like Beyonce, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. So yes, despite the contributions of black women to feminism for over a century, it is still, for some reason seen as a white women's movement predominantly. And that's a problem.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>You quote, Audre Lorde, on white feminist appropriation of black feminist thinking. Could you remind us of that?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Audre Lorde, I don't want to make it seem like that was her main argument by any means. Because Audre Lorde's focus was actually on building political solidarity and sisterhood between women. The thing is that because of Europatriarchal knowledge and the racism that that has created in our world, we have to grapple with that also, when building political sisterhood between between women, and so this was one of the things that that Lorde had to had to raise.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>You quote a letter that she wrote to Mary Daly, the feminist Mary Daly saying something like, "how many white feminists truly read my words? Or did you merely finger through them for quotations, which he thought might valuably support an already conceived idea?" I guess reading that quote, Minna, led me to thinking about the risk of black feminism and indeed, sensuous knowledge being appropriated or taken up in a piecemeal fashion. Just to finish, how do you think moving forward that sensuous knowledge can be fully appreciated, can be fully acted upon, rather than just appropriated, quoted, co-opted? What kind of discussions should we be having?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>So the whole point in sensuous knowledge is, you know, it's written in a kind of psychoactive way, you could say. So my hope is that it kind of plants the gestalt in the readers mind, of how we can approach knowledge. And if that gestalt is planted successfully, it means that whatever issue a person is looking at, if they apply sensuous knowledge, then they will look at it from multiple angles, they will look at it from political, but also more embodied, and more soulful - just different kinds of ways. And so it's not really something that can be appropriated, if it is understood, because that means that you can't piecemeal lift ideas. I mean, that's Europatriarchal knowledge. That's what that does. With sensuous knowledge, you have to genuinely engage. And so if you are seeking to work with black women, with women from any part of the world, it's really doing that and not just using hashtags or posting banners on Instagram or whatever superficial deed that you could compare to what Mary Daly was accused of by Audre Lorde.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>That's great. Minna Salami, thank you very much for joining us, although I say thank you, but before we go, this is where we just have a quick look at the <em>New Humanist</em> archive to find something that resonates with our guests' work or ideas, or maybe that contradicts and clashes entirely. Minna, you've been reading a recent piece by Lola Okolosie. that talks about an exhibition held earlier this year in the UK in London of charts and diagrams by the African American sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, designed to counter racist thinking at the turn of the century. He gets a few mentions in your book, and I know we spoke about him briefly earlier. Tell us a bit more about him and what he means to you.</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I really enjoyed Lola's piece. I thought it brings out Du Bois's character well, and in terms of him being somebody who was a product of his time, and so he did work that is continues to resonate to me and to to many black scholars and activists, but he also contributed to what I label as Europatriarchal knowledge. He kind of was a victim of the same double consciousness that he so aptly coined and and fought against.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>The charts that Dubois made. This was for the 1900 Paris exposition. They were really early infographics, there are brightly colored designs that were used to challenge the pseudoscience of racism. And so one, for instance, was called "the assessed value of household kitchen furniture owned by Georgia Negros", which showed that the black population was, against the odds, growing in economic strength. And so I wondered, with such graphics, do you think that Du Bois was drawing attention to the limits of Europatriarchal knowledge, or perhaps the harm done by it?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>This is actually why I meant that he was both protesting and revolting against Europatriarchal knowledge, but also, in some ways, strengthening it because it's almost like Europatriarchal knowledge forced him to try to prove the humanity of black people by showing that they too, could be wealthy and could exist in the system where we rank each other and create hierarchies, rather than just because they're human beings. And so he had to refer to statistics about black wealth, in order to prove the humanity of black people.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Finally, Minna, that's something I suppose you talk about in your book, since you acknowledged this idea of the so-called minority group or the oppressed group having to orientate themselves, around the oppressor, to speak the language of the oppressor to develop a kind of protest identity, rather than being allowed to simply be. Does that idea fit in with what we're talking about here?</p> <p><strong>MS: </strong></p> <p>Absolutely. And that's why I declare that <em>Sensuous Knowledge</em> is a progress book, rather than a protest book. You know, when you protest against something, you automatically centre that thing. Whereas by progress, I'm referring to the three meanings of the word progress, so to to move forward to progress, and to raise consciousness higher, and ultimately to progress means to continue something that is unfinished. And so yes, I think it's a progress book in that sense.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>MS: there, Alice, that was such a fascinating conversation. What do you think will stick with you from what Minna had to say?</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Loads, I think, actually, I mean, the book's quite small, but it holds quite a lot of big ideas within it. And I have to say, actually, I think reading it was quite a challenge to my own way of thinking or my own prejudice, really, about ideas of kind of sensuality, eroticism, even these ideas that really we do often dismiss intellectually, I suppose they don't tend to be taken seriously. And talking to Minna got me thinking about why we don't take those seriously and what value might come from doing so. I think I was especially convinced when she gave that example, talking about the economy, and the idea that if we were to apply censorious knowledge to that, we could have an economy that was maybe more about ideas of exchange and reciprocity, rather than extraction and competition, and so on. I thought that was really interesting. And I also liked her answer, about this quite tricky issue of championing the supposedly feminine without, at the same time, essentializing women and womanhood, I thought she gave a really decent defense of that. What else struck you Samira?</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I agree. That was something quite challenging. I think about this idea of questioning forms of knowledge production and the whole way we value knowledge, and so on, I think that was really, really interesting. To hear her elaborate on the practical ways that this very theoretical discussion could be applied, and what that could look like, and what that could mean. And the idea of different cultures, when she talked about the Yoruba culture and this idea of different conceptions of how we form and hold and value knowledge. I think there's something really interesting like that; it isn't necessarily just one way as we often think.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Andalso she rather generously some people might say, reflects on the damage done by Europatriarchal knowledge to men in particular, I think she suggests even that they might be even more harmed by that kind of knowledge system than even women are at times. I think she says man is socialized to repress and neglect the emotional and embodied side of life. When I first read her book it reminded me very much of a novel actually, which is James Baldwin's <em>Giovanni's Room</em>. And that's about desire and sexuality and shame. It's an incredibly moving book, another short but powerful book about the harm done when society just doesn't make space for multiple ways of being and desiring and knowing. Somehow, that that's a work of fiction that I would pair with, with this book <em>Sensuous Knowledge</em>, I suppose, finally, I also was interested in this idea of hers that minority groups are rarely allowed to simply be, in the way that the most powerful groups in society are - you know, those who set the agenda. And she talks about the risk of orientating yourself around the oppressor, or around the person who's constructing you. who is situating you, because that can kind of lessen you, I suppose, or force you into being quite one dimensional, which is something that those who have the privilege of being empowered don't have to suffer. I suppose that could be a lesson for people looking for change and campaigning for change going into 2021.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think that's such an important point. And that reminded me of an essay that Riz Ahmed wrote for the book, the anthology, <em>The Good Immigrant</em>. He talked about being typecast and how first he was typecast as a terrorist. Then he was typecast in movies that were lampooning the idea of terrorism. And then you finally get to a stage where you can just be a guy and just be an actor, playing some person who doesn't have anything to do with all these other kind of stereotypes and so on. I think there's something really valuable in that.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Absolutely. the privilege of "just being" is an interesting idea.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Absolutely. Well, that's all for now. Next time, we'll be talking to Mareile Pfannebecker, someone who's also interested in looking askance at the taken for granted. She's the co-author of a book called <em>Work Want Work</em>, all about work and desire in late capitalism</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Head to <a href="/">newhumanist.org.uk</a> to read more about that. You'll also find reading lists and transcripts for all of the episodes in this series, <em>With Reason</em> was produced and presented by me Alice Bloch and by Samira Shackle.

<p>I am delighted to launch a new series of videos that use magic to celebrate science. Fab sleight of hand artist Will Houstoun and I produced them, supported by The Royal Society of Chemistry and chemist Dr Suzanne Fergus (University of Hertfordshire). The three videos use sleight of hand techniques to celebrate a different scientist, and do not involve any CGI or camera trickery. </p>



<p>We are excited about this new story telling technique and recently conducted an experiment that showed that it significantly boosted people&#8217;s engagement (details <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://peerj.com/articles/9610/" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>



<p>I hope that you enjoy them!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I recently co-authored a paper on how a little-known parapsychology journal was years ahead of its time.</p>



<p>Our story starts in 2011, when psychologist Daryl Bem reported several experiments that appeared to support the existence of psychic ability. Soon after, Stuart Ritchie, Chris French and I tried to replicate the studies but obtained null results. Several other academics also criticised Bem&#8217;s statistics and procedures. This type of &#8216;I have evidence for psychic ability &#8211; Oh no you don&#8217;t&#8217; back and forth has occurred many times over the years. However, this time, something odd happened.</p>



<p>Several researchers noted that the criticisms aimed at Bem’s work also applied to many studies from mainstream psychology. Many of the problems surrounded researchers changing their statistics and hypotheses after they had looked at their data, and so commentators urged researchers to submit a detailed description of their plans <strong>prior</strong> to running their studies. In 2013, psychologist Chris Chambers played a key role in getting the academic journal <em>Cortex</em>&nbsp;to adopt the procedure (known as a Registered Report), and many other journals quickly followed suit.</p>



<p>However, many academics are unaware that a little-known parapsychology journal &#8211; The European Journal of Parapsychology &#8211; implemented an early version of this concept in the 1970s. For 17&nbsp;years,&nbsp;around half of the studies in the paper were registered in advance. If the critics were right, these papers should be less likely to contain problems with their statistics and methods, and so be more likely to report spurious positive results. To find out if this was the case, I recently teamed up with Caroline Watt and Diana Kornbrot to examine the studies. The results were as expected &#8211; around 8% of the analyses from the studies that had been registered in advance were positive, compared to around 28% from the other papers. Other academics are now conducting the same sort of analyses in psychology and medicine, and finding the same pattern.</p>



<p>Academics often criticise parapsychology, but this episode is a good example of how the field is sometimes ahead of the game and can help to improve mainstream psychology. <br><br>The full paper describing this work is <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/6232/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>And Diana is now looking more broadly at openness in science. If you are a researcher with an interest in the area, you can take part in her survey <a href="https://herts.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EfYxgOn9SNkadD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Welcome to the Making Sense podcast… This is Sam Harris.</p>
<p>OK…. Well, I’ve been trying to gather my thoughts for this podcast for more than a week—and have been unsure about whether to record it at all, frankly.</p>
<p>Conversation is the only tool we have for making progress, I firmly believe that. But many of the things we most need to talk about, seem impossible to talk about.</p>
<p>I think social media is a huge part of the problem. I’ve been saying for a few years now that, with social media, we’ve all been enrolled in a psychological experiment for which no one gave consent, and it’s not at all clear how it will turn out. And it’s still not clear how it will turn out, but it’s not looking good. It’s fairly disorienting out there. All information is becoming weaponized. All communication is becoming performative. And on the most important topics, it now seems to be fury and sanctimony and bad faith almost all the time.</p>
<p>We appear to be driving ourselves crazy. Actually, crazy. As in, incapable of coming into contact with reality, unable to distinguish fact from fiction—and then becoming totally destabilized by our own powers of imagination, and confirmation bias, and then lashing out at one other on that basis.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to talk about the current moment and the current social unrest, and its possible political implications, and other cultural developments, and suggest what it might take to pull back from the brink here. I’m going to circle in on the topics of police violence and the problem of racism, because that really is at the center of this. There is so much to talk about here, and it’s so difficult to talk about. And there is so much we don’t know. And yet, most people are behaving as though every important question was answered a long time ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching our country seem to tear itself apart for weeks now, and perhaps lay the ground for much worse to come. And I’ve been resisting the temptation to say anything of substance—not because I don’t have anything to say, but because of my perception of the danger, frankly. And if that’s the way I feel, given the pains that I’ve taken to insulate myself from those concerns, I know that almost everyone with a public platform is terrified. Journalists, and editors, and executives, and celebrities are terrified that they might take one wrong step here, and never recover.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdsmxzaHtSQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>And this is really unhealthy—not just for individuals, but for society. Because, again, all we have between us and the total breakdown of civilization is a series of successful conversations. If we can’t reason with one another, there is no path forward, other than violence. Conversation or violence.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to talk about some of the things that concern me about the current state of our communication. Unfortunately, many things are compounding our problems at the moment. We have a global pandemic which is still very much with us. And it remains to be seen how much our half-hearted lockdown, and our ineptitude in testing, and our uncoordinated reopening, and now our plunge into social protest and civil unrest will cause the Covid-19 caseload to spike. We will definitely see. As many have pointed out, the virus doesn’t care about economics or politics. It only cares that we keep breathing down each other’s necks. And we’ve certainly been doing enough of that.</p>
<p>Of course, almost no one can think about Covid-19 right now. But I’d just like to point out that many of the costs of this pandemic and the knock-on effects in the economy, and now this protest movement, many of these costs are hidden from us. In addition to killing more than 100,000 people in the US, the pandemic has been a massive opportunity cost. The ongoing implosion of the economy is imposing tangible costs, yes, but it is also a massive opportunity cost. And now this civil unrest is compounding those problems—whatever the merits of these protests may be or will be, the opportunity costs of this moment are staggering. In addition to all the tangible effects of what’s happening—the injury and death, the lost businesses, the burned buildings, the neighborhoods that won’t recover for years in many cities, the educations put on hold, and the breakdown in public trust of almost every institution—just think about all the good and important things we cannot do—cannot even <em>think</em> of doing now—and perhaps won’t contemplate doing for many years to come, because we’ll be struggling to get back to that distant paradise we once called “normal life.”</p>
<p>Of course, normal life for many millions of Americans was nothing like a paradise. The disparities in wealth and health and opportunity that we have gotten used to in this country, and that so much of our politics and ways of doing business seem to take for granted, are just unconscionable. There is no excuse for this kind of inequality in the richest country on earth. What we’re seeing now is a response to that. But it’s a confused and confusing response. Worse, it’s a response that is systematically silencing honest conversation. And this makes it dangerous.</p>
<p>This isn’t just politics and human suffering on display. It’s philosophy. It’s ideas about truth—about what it means to say that something is “true.” What we’re witnessing in our streets and online and in the impossible conversations we’re attempting to have in our private lives is a breakdown in epistemology. How does anyone figure out what’s going on in the world? What is real? If we can’t agree about what is real, or likely to be real, we will never agree about how we should live together. And the problem is, we’re stuck with one other.</p>
<p>So, what’s happening here?</p>
<p>Well, again, it’s hard to say. What is happening when <a href="https://youtu.be/viika57hTO4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a police officer or a mayor takes a knee</a> in front of a crowd of young people who have been berating him for being a cog in the machinery of systemic racism? Is this a profound moment of human bonding that transcends politics, or is it the precursor to the breakdown of society? Or is it both? It’s not entirely clear.</p>
<p>In the most concrete terms, we are experiencing widespread social unrest in response to what is widely believed to be an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at the black community by racist cops and racist policies. And this unrest has drawn a counter-response from law enforcement—much of which, ironically, is guaranteed to exacerbate the problem of police violence, both real and perceived. And many of the videos we’ve seen of the police cracking down on peaceful protesters are hideous. Some of this footage has been unbelievable. And this is one of many vicious circles that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>Again, there is so much to be confused about here. We’ve now seen endless video of police inflicting senseless violence on truly peaceful protesters, and yet we have also seen video of the police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrVp8vlQyU">standing idly by</a> while looters completely destroy businesses. What explains this? Is there a policy that led to this bizarre inversion of priorities? Are the police angry at the protesters for vilifying them, and simultaneously trying to teach society a lesson by letting crime and mayhem spread elsewhere in the city? Or is it just less risky to collide with peaceful protesters? Or is the whole spectacle itself a lie? How representative are these videos of what’s actually going on? Is there much less chaos actually occurring than is being advertised to us?</p>
<p>Again, it’s very hard to know.</p>
<p>What’s easy to know is that civil discourse has broken down. It seems to me that we’ve long been in a situation where the craziest voices on both ends of the political spectrum have been amplifying one another and threatening to produce something truly dangerous. And now I think they have. The amount of misinformation in the air—the degree to which even serious people seem to be ruled by false assumptions and non sequiturs—is just astonishing.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep in mind that, with the presidential election coming in November, the stakes are really high. As most of you know, I consider four more years of Trump to be an existential threat to our democracy. And I believe that the last two weeks have been very good for him, politically, even when everything else seemed to go very badly for him. I know the polls don’t say this. A large majority of people disapprove of his handling this crisis so far. But I think we all know now to take polls with a grain of salt. There is the very real problem of preference falsification—especially in an environment of intense social pressure. People will often say what they think is socially acceptable, and then think, or say, or do something very different in private—like when they’re alone in a voting booth.</p>
<p>Trump has presided over the complete dismantling of American influence in the world and the destruction of our economy. I know the stock market has looked good, but the stock market has become totally uncoupled from the economy. According to the stock market, the future is just as bright now as it was in January of this year, before most of us had even heard of a novel coronavirus. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. And a lot can happen in the next few months. The last two weeks feel like a decade. And my concern is that if Trump now gets to be the law-and-order President, that may be his path to re-election, if such a path exists. Of course, this crisis has revealed, yet again, how unfit he is to be President. The man couldn’t strike a credible note of reconciliation if the fate of the country depended on it—and the fate of the country has depended on it. I also think it’s possible that these protests wouldn’t be happening, but for the fact that Trump is President. Whether or not the problem of racism has gotten worse in our society, having Trump as President surely makes it seem like it has. It has been such a repudiation of the Obama presidency that, for many people, it has made it seem that white supremacy is now ascendant. So, all the more reason to get rid of Trump in November.</p>
<p>But before this social unrest, our focus was on how incompetent Trump was in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. And now he has been given a very different battle to fight. A battle against leftwing orthodoxy, which is growing more stifling by the minute, and civil unrest. If our social order frays sufficiently, restoring it will be the only thing that most people care about in November. Just think of what an act of domestic terrorism would do politically now. Things can change very, very quickly. And to all a concern for basic law and order “racist”, isn’t going to wash.</p>
<p>Trust in institutions has totally broken down. We’ve been under a very precarious quarantine for more than 3 months, which almost the entire medical profession has insisted is necessary. Doctors and public health officials have castigated people on the political Right for protesting this lockdown. People have been unable to be with their loved ones in their last hours of life. They’ve been unable to hold funerals for them. But now we have doctors and public officials by the thousands, signing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letters</a>, making public statements, saying it’s fine to stand shoulder to shoulder with others in the largest protests our nation has ever seen. The degree to which this has undermined confidence in public health messaging is hard to exaggerate. Whatever your politics, this has been just a mortifying piece of hypocrisy. Especially so, because the pandemic has been hitting the African American community hardest of all. How many people will die because of these protests? It’s a totally rational question to ask, but the question itself is taboo now.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that almost everything appears upside down at the moment.</p>
<p>Before I get into details on police violence, first let me try to close the door to a few misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the proximate cause of all this: The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. I’ll have more to say about this in a minute, but nothing I say should detract from the following observation: That <a href="https://youtu.be/vksEJR9EPQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> was absolutely sickening, and it revealed a degree of police negligence and incompetence and callousness that everyone was right to be horrified by. In particular, the actions of Derek Chauvin, the cop who kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes, his actions were so reckless and so likely to cause harm that there&#8217;s no question he should be prosecuted. And he is being prosecuted. He’s been indicted for 2nd degree murder and manslaughter, and I suspect he will spend many, many years in prison. And, this is not to say “the system is working.” It certainly seems likely that without the cell phone video, and the public outrage, Chauvin might have gotten away with it—to say nothing of the other cops with him, who are also now being prosecuted. If this is true, we clearly need a better mechanism with which to police the police.</p>
<p>So, as I said, I&#8217;ll return to this topic, because I think most people are drawing the wrong conclusions from this video, and from videos like it, but let me just echo everyone&#8217;s outrage over what happened. This is precisely the kind of police behavior that everyone should find abhorrent.</p>
<p>On the general topic of racism in America, I want to make a few similarly clear, preemptive statements:</p>
<p>Racism is still a problem in American society. No question. And slavery—which was racism’s most evil expression—was this country’s founding sin. We should also add the near-total eradication of the Native Americans to that ledger of evil. Any morally sane person who learns the details of these historical injustices finds them shocking, whatever their race. And the legacy of these crimes—crimes that were perpetrated for centuries—remains a cause for serious moral concern today. I have no doubt about this. And nothing I’m about to say, should suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>And I don’t think it’s an accident that the two groups I just mentioned, African Americans and Native Americans, suffer the worst from inequality in America today. How could the history of racial discrimination in this country not have had lasting effects, given the nature of that history? And if anything good comes out of the current crisis, it will be that we manage to find a new commitment to reducing inequality in all its dimensions. The real debate to have is about how to do this, economically and politically. But the status quo that many of us take for granted to is a betrayal of our values, whether we realize it or not. If it’s not a betrayal or your values now, it will be a betrayal of your values when you become a better person. And if you don’t manage that, it will be a betrayal of your kid’s values when they’re old enough to understand the world they are living in. The difference between being very lucky in our society, and very unlucky, should not be as enormous as it is.</p>
<p>However, the question that interests me, given what has been true of the past and is now true of the present, is what should we do next? What should we do to build a healthier society?</p>
<p>What should we do next?  Tomorrow… next week…. Obviously, I don’t have the answers. But I am very worried that many of the things we’re doing now, and seem poised to do, will only make our problems worse. And I’m especially worried that it has become so difficult to talk about this. I’m just trying to have conversations. I’m just trying to figure these things out in real time, with other people. And there is no question that conversation itself has become dangerous.</p>
<p>Think about the politics of this. Endless imagery of people burning and looting independent businesses that were struggling to survive, and seeing the owners of these businesses beaten by mobs, cannot be good for the cause of social justice. Looting and burning businesses, and assaulting their owners, isn’t social justice, or even social protest. It’s crime. And having imagery of these crimes that highlight black involvement circulate endlessly on Fox News and on social media cannot be good for the black community. But it might yet be good for Trump.</p>
<p>And it could well kick open the door to a level of authoritarianism that many of us who have been very worried about Trump barely considered possible. It’s always seemed somewhat paranoid to me to wonder whether we’re living in Weimar Germany. I’ve had many conversations about this. I had <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-road-to-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Snyder on the podcast</a>, who’s been worrying about the prospect of tyranny in the US for several years now. I’ve known, in the abstract, that democracies can destroy themselves. But the idea that it could happen here still seemed totally outlandish to me. It doesn’t anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, what we’ve been seeing in the streets isn’t just one thing. Some people are protesting for reasons that I fully defend. They’re outraged by specific instances of police violence, like the killing of George Floyd, and they’re worried about creeping authoritarianism—which we really should be worried about now. And they’re convinced that our politics is broken, because it is broken, and they are deeply concerned that our response to the pandemic and the implosion of our economy will do nothing to address the widening inequality in our society. And they recognize that we have a President who is an incompetent, divisive, conman and a crackpot at a time when we actually need wise leadership.</p>
<p>All of that is hard to put on a sign, but it’s all worth protesting.</p>
<p>However, it seems to me that most protesters are seeing this moment exclusively through the lens of identity politics—and racial politics in particular. And some of them are even celebrating the breakdown of law and order, or at least remaining nonjudgmental about it. And you could see, in the early days of this protest, news anchors take that line, on CNN, for instance. Talking about the history of social protest, “Sometimes it has to be violent, right? What, do you think all of these protests need to be nonviolent?” Those words came out of Chris Cuomo&#8217;s mouth, and Don Lemon&#8217;s mouth. Many people have been circulating a half quote from Martin Luther King Jr. about riots being “the language of the unheard.” They’re <a href="https://youtu.be/pjYZZC5i_AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving out the part</a> where he made it clear that he believed riots harmed the cause of the black community and helped the cause of racists.</p>
<p>There are now calls to defund and even to abolish the police. This may be psychologically understandable when you’ve spent half your day on Twitter watching videos of cops beating peaceful protesters. Those videos are infuriating. And I’ll have a lot more to say about police violence in a minute. But if you think a society without cops is a society you would want to live in, you have lost your mind. Giving a monopoly on violence to the state is just about the best thing we have ever done as a species. It ranks right up there with keeping our shit out of our food. Having a police force that can deter crime, and solve crimes when they occur, and deliver violent criminals to a functioning justice system, is the necessary precondition for almost anything else of value in society.</p>
<p>We need police reform, of course. There are serious questions to ask about the culture of policing—its hiring practices, training, the militarization of so many police forces, outside oversight, how police departments deal with corruption, the way the police unions keep bad cops on the job, and yes, the problem of racist cops. But the idea that any serious person thinks we can do without the police—or that less trained and less vetted cops will magically be better than more trained and more vetted ones—this just reveals that our conversation on these topics has run completely off the rails. Yes, we should give more resources to community services. We should have psychologists or social workers make first contact with the homeless or the mentally ill. Perhaps we’re giving cops jobs they shouldn’t be doing. All of that makes sense to rethink. But the idea that what we&#8217;re witnessing now is a matter of the cops being over-resourced—that we&#8217;ve given them too much training, that we&#8217;ve made the job too attractive—so that the people we’re recruiting are of too high a quality. That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s been alarming here is that we’re seeing prominent people—in government, in media, in Hollywood, in sports—speak and act as though the breakdown of civil society, and of society itself, is a form of progress and any desire for law enforcement is itself a form of racist oppression. At one point the woman who&#8217;s running the City Council in Minneapolis, which just decided to abolish the police force, was asked by a journalist, I believe on CNN, “What do I do if someone&#8217;s breaking into my house in the middle of the night? Who do I call?” And her first response to that question was, “You need to recognize what a statement of privilege that question is.” She&#8217;s since had to walk that back, because it&#8217;s one of the most galling and embarrassing things a public official has ever said, but this is how close the Democratic Party is to sounding completely insane. You cannot say that if someone is breaking into your house, and you&#8217;re terrified, and you want a police force that can respond, that fear is a symptom of “white privilege.” This is where Democratic politics goes to die.</p>
<p>Again, what is alarming about this is that this woke analysis of the breakdown of law and order will only encourage an increasingly authoritarian response, as well as the acceptance of that response by many millions of Americans.</p>
<p>If you step back, you will notice that there is a kind of ecstasy of ideological conformity in the air. And it’s destroying institutions. It&#8217;s destroying the very institutions we rely on to get our information—universities, the press. The New York Times in recent days, seems to be preparing for a self-immolation in recent days. No one wants to say or even think anything that makes anyone uncomfortable—certainly not anyone who has more wokeness points than they do. It’s just become too dangerous. There are people <a href="https://wwos.nine.com.au/news/nba-announcer-fired-over-controversial-all-lives-matter-tweet/a9a50198-4b52-4cb7-a800-e0ffacb3302d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being fired</a> for tweeting “All Lives Matter.” #AllLivesMatter, in the current environment, is being read as a naked declaration of white supremacy. That is how weird this moment is. A soccer player on the LA Galaxy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/rowdies/2020/06/05/la-galaxy-releases-player-after-wifes-racist-and-violent-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fired</a> for something his wife tweeted…</p>
<p>Of course, there are real problems of inequality and despair at the bottom of these protests. People who have never found a secure or satisfying place in the world—or young people who fear they never will—people who have seen their economic prospects simply vanish, and people who have had painful encounters with racism and racist cops—people by the millions are now surrendering themselves to a kind of religious awakening. But like most religious awakenings, this movement is not showing itself eager to make honest contact with reality.</p>
<p>On top of that, we find extraordinarily privileged people, whatever the color of their skin—people who have been living wonderful lives in their gated communities or 5<sup>th</sup> avenue apartments—and who feel damn guilty about it—they are supporting this movement uncritically, for many reasons. Of course, they care about other people—I’m sure most of them have the same concerns about inequality that I do—but they are also supporting this movement because it promises a perfect expiation of their sins. If you have millions of dollars, and shoot botox into your face, and vacation on St. Bart’s, and you’re liberal—the easiest way to sleep at night is to be as woke as AOC and like every one of her tweets.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just with the looting, and the arson, and the violence. There are problems with these peaceful protests themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not questioning anyone’s right to protest. Even our deranged president can pay lip service to that right—which he did as the DC police were violently dispersing a peaceful protest so that he could get his picture taken in front of that church, awkwardly holding a bible, as though he had never held a book in life.</p>
<p>The problem with the protests is that they are animated, to a remarkable degree, by confusion and misinformation. And I’ll explain why I think that’s the case. And, of course, this will be controversial. Needless to say, many people will consider the color of my skin to be disqualifying here. I could have invited any number of great, black intellectuals onto the podcast to make these points for me. But that struck me as a form of cowardice. Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Coleman Hughes, Kmele Foster, these guys might not agree with everything I’m about to say, but any one of them could walk the tightrope I’m now stepping out on far more credibly than I can.</p>
<p>But, you see, that’s part of the problem. The perception that the color of a person’s skin, or even his life experience, matters for this discussion is a pernicious illusion. For the discussion we really need to have, the color of a person’s skin, and even his life experience, simply does not matter. It cannot matter. We have to break this spell that the politics of identity has cast over everything.</p>
<p>Ok…</p>
<p>As I’ve already acknowledged, there is a legacy of racism in the United States that we’re still struggling to outgrow. That is obvious. There are real racists out there. And there are ways in which racism became institutionalized long ago. Many of you will remember that during the crack epidemic the penalties for crack and powder cocaine were quite different. And this led black drug offenders to be locked up for much longer than white ones. Now, whether the motivation for that policy was consciously racist or not, I don’t know, but it was effectively racist. Nothing I’m about to say entails a denial of these sorts of facts. There just seems to be no question that boys who grow up with their fathers in prison start life with a significant strike against them. So criminal justice reform is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>And I’m not denying that many black people, perhaps most, have interactions with cops, and others in positions of power, or even random strangers, that seem unambiguously racist. Sometimes this is because they are actually in the presence of racism, and perhaps sometimes it only seems that way. I’ve had unpleasant encounters with cops, and customs officers, and TSA screeners, and bureaucrats of every kind, and even with people working in stores or restaurants. People aren’t always nice or ethical. But being white, and living in a majority white society, I’ve never had to worry about whether any of these collisions were the result of racism. And I can well imagine that in some of these situations, had I been black, I would have come away feeling that I had encountered yet another racist in the wild. So I consider myself very lucky to have gone through life not having to think about any of that. Surely that’s one form of white privilege.</p>
<p>So, nothing I’m going to say denies that we should condemn racism—whether interpersonal or institutional—and we should condemn it wherever we find it. But as a society, we simply can’t afford to find and condemn racism where it doesn’t exist. And we should be increasingly aware of the costs of doing that. The more progress we make on issues of race, the less racism there will be to find, and the more likely we’ll find ourselves chasing after its ghost.</p>
<p>The truth is, we have made considerable progress on the problem of racism in America. This isn’t 1920, and it isn’t 1960. We had a two-term black president. We have black congressmen and women. We have black mayors and black chiefs of police. There are major cities, like Detroit and Atlanta, going on their fifth or sixth consecutive black mayor. Having more and more black people in positions of real power, in what is still a majority white society, is progress on the problem of racism. And the truth is, it might not even solve the problem we’re talking about. When Freddy Gray was killed in Baltimore, virtually everyone who could have been held accountable for his death was black. The problem of police misconduct and reform is complicated, as we’re about to see. But obviously, there is more work to do on the problem of racism. And, more important, there is much more work to do to remedy the inequalities in our society that are so correlated with race, and will still be correlated with race, even after the last racist has been driven from our shores.</p>
<p>The question of how much of today’s inequality is due to existing racism—whether racist people or racist policies—is a genuinely difficult question to answer. And to answer it, we need to distinguish the past from the present.</p>
<p>Take wealth inequality, for example: The median white family has a net worth of around $170,000—these data are a couple of years old, but they’re probably pretty close to what’s true now. The median black family has a net worth of around $17,000. So we have a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/06/18/a-conversation-about-the-racial-wealth-gap-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenfold difference in median wealth</a>. (That’s the median, not the mean: Half of white families are below 170,000 and half above; half of black families are below 17,000 and half above. And we’re talking about wealth here, not income.)</p>
<p>This disparity in wealth persists even for people whose incomes are in the top 10 percent of the income distribution. For whites in the top 10 percent for income, the median net worth is $1.8 million; for blacks it’s around $350,000. There are probably many things that account for this disparity in wealth. It seems that black families that make it to the top of the income distribution fall out of it more easily than white families do. But it’s also undeniable that black families have less intergenerational wealth accumulated through inheritance.</p>
<p>How much of this is inequality due to the legacy of slavery? And how much of it is due to an ensuing century of racist policies? I’m prepared to believe quite a lot. And it strikes me as totally legitimate to think about paying reparations as a possible remedy here. Of course, one will then need to talk about reparations for the Native Americans. And then one wonders where this all ends. And what about blacks who aren’t descended from slaves, but who still suffered the consequences of racism in the US? In listening to people like <a href="https://youtu.be/FXt9Q5h1sCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McWhorter</a> and Coleman Hughes discuss this topic, I’m inclined to think that reparations is probably unworkable as a policy. But the truth is that I’m genuinely unsure about this.</p>
<p>Whatever we decide about the specific burdens of the past, we have to ask, how much of current wealth inequality is due to existing racism and to existing policies that make it harder for black families to build wealth? And the only way to get answers to those questions is to have a dispassionate discussion about facts.</p>
<p>The problem with the social activism we are now seeing—what John McWhorter has called “the new religion of anti-Racism”—is that it finds racism nearly everywhere, even where it manifestly does not exist. And this is incredibly damaging to the cause of achieving real equality in our society. It’s almost impossible to exaggerate the evil and injustice of slavery and its aftermath. But it is possible to exaggerate how much racism currently exists at an Ivy League university, or in Silicon Valley, or at the Oscars. And those exaggerations are toxic—and, perversely, they may produce more real racism. It seems to me that false claims of victimhood can diminish the social stature of any group, even a group that has a long history of real victimization.</p>
<p>The imprecision here—the bad-faith arguments, the double standards, the goal-post shifting, the <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hrFzz1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idiotic opinion pieces</a> in the New York Times, the defenestrations on social media, the general hysteria that the cult of wokeness has produced—I think this is all extremely harmful to civil society, and to effective liberal politics, and to the welfare of African Americans.</p>
<p>So, with that as preamble, let’s return to the tragic death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>As I said, I believe that any sane person who watches that video will feel that they have witnessed a totally unjustified killing. So, people of any race, are right to be horrified by what happened there. But now I want to ask a few questions, and I want us to try to consider them dispassionately. And I really want you to watch your mind while you do this. There are very likely to be few tripwires installed there, and I’m about to hit them. So just do your best to remain calm.</p>
<p>Does the killing of George Floyd prove that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>Does it even suggest that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>In other words, do we have reason to believe that, had Floyd been white, he wouldn’t have died in a similar way?</p>
<p>Do the dozen or so other videos that have emerged in recent years, of black men being killed by cops, do they prove, or even suggest, that there is an epidemic of lethal police violence directed especially at black men and that this violence is motivated by racism?</p>
<p>Most people seem to think that the answers to these questions are so obvious that to even pose them as I just did is obscene. The answer is YES, and it’s a yes that now needs to be shouted in the streets.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that if you take even 5 minutes to look at the data on crime and police violence, the answer appears to be “no,” in every case, albeit with one important caveat. I’m not talking about how the police behaved in 1970 or even 1990. But in the last 25 years, violent crime has come down significantly in the US, and so has the police use of deadly force. And as you’re about to see, the police used more deadly force against white people—both in absolute numbers, and in terms of their contribution to crime and violence in our society. But the public perception is, of course, completely different.</p>
<p>In a city like Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-12/lapd-use-of-force-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 was a 30-year low</a> for police shootings. Think about that…. Do the people who were protesting in Los Angeles, peacefully and violently, do the people who were ransacking and burning businesses by the hundreds—in many cases, businesses that will not return to their neighborhoods—do the people who caused so much damage to the city, that certain neighborhoods, ironically the neighborhoods that are disproportionately black, will take years, probably decades to recover, do the celebrities who supported them, and even bailed them out of jail—do any of these people know that 2019 was the 30-year low for police shootings in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Before I step out further over the abyss here, let me reiterate: Many of you are going to feel a visceral negative reaction to what I’m about to say. You’re not going to like the way it sounds. You’re especially not going to like the way it sounds coming from a white guy. This feeling of not liking, this feeling of outrage, this feeling of disgust—this feeling of “Sam, what the fuck is wrong with you, why are you even touching this topic?”—this feeling isn’t an argument. It isn’t, or shouldn’t be, the basis for your believing anything to be true or false about the world.</p>
<p>Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that I or anyone else needs to respect. Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that you should respect. In fact, it is something that you should be on your guard for. Perhaps more than any other property of your mind, this feeling can mislead you.</p>
<p>If you care about justice—and you absolutely should—you should care about facts and the ability to discuss them openly. Justice requires contact with reality. It simply isn’t the case—it cannot be the case—that the most pressing claims on our sense of justice need come from those who claim to be the most offended by conversation itself.</p>
<p>So, I’m going to speak the language of facts right now, in so far as we know them, all the while knowing that these facts run very much counter to most people’s assumptions. Many of the things you think you know about crime and violence in our society are almost certainly wrong. And that should matter to you.</p>
<p>So just take a moment and think this through with me.</p>
<p>How many people are killed each year in America by cops? If you don’t know, guess. See if you have any intuitions for these numbers. Because your intuitions are determining how you interpret horrific videos of the sort we saw coming out of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The answer for many years running is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 1000</a>. One thousand people are killed by cops in America each year. There are about 50 to 60 million encounters between civilians and cops each year, and <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 10 million arrests</a>. That’s down from a high of over 14 million arrests annually throughout the 1990’s. So, of the 10 million occasions where a person attracts the attention of the police, and the police decide to make an arrest, about 1000 of those people die as a result. (I’m sure a few people get killed even when no arrest was attempted, but that has to be a truly tiny number.) So, without knowing anything else about the situation, if the cops decide to arrest you, it would be reasonable to think that your chance of dying is around 1/10,000. Of course, in the United States, it’s higher than it is in other countries. So I’m not saying that this number is acceptable. But it is what it is for a reason, as we’re about to see.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few generic things I’d like to point here before we get further into the data. They should be uncontroversial.</p>
<p>First, it’s almost certainly the case that of these 1000 officer-caused deaths each year, some are entirely justified—it may even be true that most are entirely justified—and some are entirely unjustified, and some are much harder to judge. And that will be true next year. And the year after that.</p>
<p>Of the unjustified killings, there are vast differences between them. Many have nothing in common but for the fact that a cop killed someone unnecessarily. It might have been a terrible misunderstanding, or incompetence, or just bad luck, and in certain cases it could be a cop who decides to murder someone because he’s become enraged, or he’s just a psychopath. And it is certainly possible that racial bias accounts for some number of these unjustified killings.</p>
<p>Another point that should be uncontroversial—but may sound a little tone-deaf in the current environment, where we’ve inundated with videos of police violence in response to these protests. But this has to be acknowledged whenever we’re discussing this topic: Cops have a very hard job. In fact, in the current environment, they have an almost impossible job.</p>
<p>If you’re making 10 million arrests every year, some number of people will decide not to cooperate. There can be many reasons for this. A person could be mentally ill, or drunk, or on drugs. Of course, rather often the person is an actual criminal who doesn’t want to be arrested.</p>
<p>Among innocent people, and perhaps this getting more common these days, a person might feel that resisting arrest is the right thing to do, ethically or politically or as a matter of affirming his identity. After all, put yourself in his shoes, he did nothing wrong. Why are the cops arresting him? I don’t know if we have data on the numbers of people who resist arrest by race. But I can well imagine that if it’s common for African Americans to believe that the only reason they have been singled out for arrest is due to racism on the part of the police, that could lead to greater levels of non-compliance. Which seems very likely to lead to more unnecessary injury and death. This is certainly one reason why it is wise to have the racial composition of a police force mirror that of the community it’s policing. Unfortunately, there’s no evidence that this will reduce lethal violence from the side of the police. In fact, the evidence we have suggests that black and Hispanic cops are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. But it would surely change the perception of the community that racism is a likely explanation for police behavior, which itself might reduce conflict.</p>
<p>When a cop goes hands on a person in an attempt to control his movements or make an arrest, that person’s resistance poses a problem that most people don’t understand. If you haven’t studied this topic. If you don’t know what it physically takes to restrain and immobilize a non-compliant person who may be bigger and stronger than you are, and if you haven’t thought through the implications of having a gun on your belt while attempting to do that—a gun that can be grabbed and used against you, or against a member of the public—then your intuitions about what makes sense here, tactically and ethically, are very likely to be bad.</p>
<p>If you haven’t trained with firearms under stress. If you don’t know how suddenly situations can change. If you haven’t experienced how quickly another person can close the distance on you, and how little time you have to decide to draw your weapon. If you don’t know how hard it is to shoot a moving target, or even a stationary one, when your heart is beating out of your chest. You very likely have totally unreasonable ideas about what we can expect from cops in situations like these. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwWado4SVY&amp;bpctr=1592453276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbOLb0O7Pw&amp;bpctr=1592455027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_87GBOCVYTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]</p>
<p>And there is another fact that looms over all this like the angel of Death, literally: Most cops do not get the training they need. They don’t get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQLOmfx8X_E&amp;feature=emb_title">hand-to-hand training</a> they need—they don’t have good skills to subdue people without harming them. All you need to do is watch YouTube videos of botched arrests to see this. The martial arts community stands in perpetual astonishment at <a href="https://youtu.be/F4VeHOkt_o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kinds of things cops do and fail to do</a> once they start fighting with suspects. Cops also don’t get the firearms training they need. Of course, there are elite units in many police departments, but most cops do not have the training they need to do the job they’re being asked to do.</p>
<p>It is also true, no doubt, that some cops are racist bullies. And there are corrupt police departments that cover for these guys, and cover up police misconduct generally, whether it was borne of racism or not.</p>
<p>But the truth is that even if we got rid of all bad cops, which we absolutely should do, and there were only good people left, and we got all these good people the best possible training, and we gave them the best culture in which to think about their role in society, and we gave them the best methods for de-escalating potentially violent situations—which we absolutely must do—and we scrubbed all the dumb laws from our books, so that when cops were required to enforce the law, they were only risking their lives and the lives of civilians for reasons that we deem necessary and just—so the war on drugs is obviously over—even under these conditions of perfect progress, we are still guaranteed to have some number of cases each year where a cop kills a civilian in a way that is totally unjustified, and therefore tragic. Every year, there will be some number of families who will be able to say that the cops killed their son or daughter, or father or mother, or brother or sister. And videos of these killings will occasionally surface, and they will be horrific. This seems guaranteed to happen.</p>
<p>So, while we need to make all these improvements, we still need to understand that there are very likely always to going to be videos of cops doing something inexplicable, or inexplicably stupid, that results in an innocent person’s death, or a not-so-innocent person’s death. And sometimes the cop will be white and the victim will be black. We have 10 million arrests each year. And we now live in a panopticon where practically everything is videotaped.</p>
<p>I’m about to get further into the details of what we know about police violence, but I want to just put it to you now: If we’re going to let the health of race relations in this country, or the relationship between the community and the police, depend on whether we ever see a terrible video of police misconduct again, the project of healing these wounds in our society is doomed.</p>
<p>About a week into these protests I heard Van Jones on CNN say, “If we see one more video of a cop brutalizing a black man, this country could go over the edge.” He said this, not as indication of how dangerously inflamed people have become. He seemed to be saying it as an ultimatum to the police. With 10 million arrests a year, arrests that have to take place in the most highly armed society in the developed world, I hope you understand how unreasonable that ultimatum is.</p>
<p>We have to put these videos into context. And we have to acknowledge how different they are from one another. Some of them are easy to interpret. But some are quite obviously being interpreted incorrectly by most people—especially by activists. And there are a range of cases—some have video associated with them and some don’t—that are now part of a litany of anti-racist outrage, and the names of the dead are intoned as though they were all evidence of the same injustice. And yet, they are not.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XKQqgVlk0NQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Scott</a> was stopped for a broken taillight and got out of his car and tried to flee. There might have been a brief struggle over the officer’s taser, that part of the video isn’t clear. But what is clear is that he was shot in the back multiple times as he was running away. That was insane. There was zero reason for the officer to feel that his life was under threat at the point he opened fire. And for that unjustified shooting, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. I’m not sure that’s long enough. That seemed like straight-up murder.</p>
<p>The George Floyd video, while even more disturbing to watch, is harder to interpret. I don’t know anything about Derek Chauvin, the cop who knelt on his neck. It’s quite possible that he’s a terrible person who should have never been a cop. He seems to have a significant number of complaints against him—though, as far as I know, the details of those complaints haven’t been released. And he might be a racist on top of being a bad cop. Or he might be a guy who was totally in over his head and thought you could restrain someone indefinitely by keeping a knee on their neck indefinitely. I don’t know. I’m sure more facts will come out. But whoever he is, I find it very unlikely that he was intending to kill George Floyd. Think about it. He was surrounded by irate witnesses and being filmed. Unless he was aspiring to become the most notorious murderer in human history, it seems very unlikely that he was intending to commit murder in that moment. It’s possible, of course. But it doesn’t seem the likeliest explanation for his behavior.</p>
<p>What I believe we saw on that video was the result of a tragic level of negligence and poor training on the part of those cops. Or terrible recruitment—it’s possible that none of these guys should have ever been cops. I think for one of them, it was only his fourth day on the job. Just imagine that. Just imagine all things you don’t know as a new cop.  It could also be a function of bad luck in terms of Floyd’s underlying health. It’s been reported that he was complaining of being unable to breath before Chauvin pinned him with his knee. The knee on his neck might not have been the only thing that caused his death. It could have also been the weight of the other officer pinning him down.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly what happened in the cast of Eric Garner. Half the people on earth believe they witnessed a cop choke Eric Garner to death in that video. That does not appear to be what happened. When Eric Garner is saying “I can’t breathe” he’s not being choked. He’s being held down on the pavement by several officers. Being forced down on your stomach under the weight of several people can kill a person, especially someone with lung or heart disease. In the case of Eric Garner, it is absolutely clear that the cop who briefly attempted to choke him was no longer choking him. If you doubt that, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/Nql1xRtWKOU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> again.</p>
<p>And if you are recoiling now from my interpretation of these videos, you really should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_c-E_i8Q5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the killing of Tony Timpa</a>. It’s also terribly disturbing, but it removes the variable of race and it removes any implication of intent to harm on the part of the cops about as clearly as you could ask. It really is worth watching as a corrective to our natural interpretation of these other videos.</p>
<p>Tony Timpa was a white man in Dallas, who was suffering some mental health emergency and cocaine intoxication. And he actually called 911 himself. What we see is the bodycam footage from the police, which shows that he was already in handcuffs when they arrived—a security guard had cuffed him. And then the cops take over, and they restrain Timpa on the ground, by rolling him onto a stomach and putting their weight on him, very much like in the case of Eric Garner. And they keep their weight on him—one cop has a knee on his upper back, which is definitely much less aggressive than a knee on the neck—but they crush the life out of him all the same, over the course of 13 minutes. He’s not being choked. The cops are not being rough. There’s no animus between them and Timpa. It was not a hostile arrest. They clearly believe that they’re responding to a mental health emergency. But they keep him down on his belly, under their weight, and they’re cracking jokes as he loses consciousness. Now, your knowledge that he’s going to be dead by the end of this video, make their jokes seem pretty callous. But this was about as benign an imposition of force by cops as you’re going to see. The crucial insight you will have watching this video, is that the officers not only had no intent to kill Tony Timpa, they don’t take his pleading seriously because they have no doubt that what they’re doing is perfectly safe—perfectly within protocol. They’ve probably done this hundreds of times before.</p>
<p>If you watch that video—and, again, fair warning, it is disturbing—but imagine how disturbing it would have been to our society if Tony Timpa had been black. If the only thing you changed about the video was the color of Timpa’s skin, then that video would have detonated like a nuclear bomb in our society, exactly as the George Floyd video did. In fact, in one way it is worse, or would have been perceived to be worse. I mean, just imagine white cops telling jokes as they crushed the life out of a black Tony Timpa… Given the nature of our conversation about violence, given the way we perceive videos of this kind, there is no way that people would have seen that as anything other than a lynching. And yet, it would not have been a lynching.</p>
<p>Now, I obviously have no idea what was in the minds of cops in Minneapolis. And perhaps we’ll learn at trial. Perhaps a tape of Chauvin using the N-word in another context will surface, bringing in a credible allegation of racism. It seems to me that Chauvin is going to have a very hard time making sense of his actions. But most people who saw that video believe they have seen, with their own eyes, beyond any possibility of doubt, a racist cop intentionally murder an innocent man. That’s not what the video necessarily shows.</p>
<p>As I said, these videos can be hard to interpret, even while seeming very easy to interpret. And these cases, whether we have associated video or not, are very different. Michael Brown is reported to have punched a cop in the face and attempted to get his gun. As far as I know, there’s no video of that encounter. But, if true, that is an entirely different situation. If you’re attacking a cop, trying to get his gun, that is a life and death struggle that almost by definition for the cop, and it most cases justifies the use of lethal force. And honestly, it seems that no one within a thousand miles of Black Lives Matter is willing to make these distinctions. An attitude of anti-racist moral outrage is not the best lens through which to interpret evidence of police misconduct.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many videos of people getting arrested. And I’ve seen the outraged public reaction to what appears to be inappropriate use of force by the cops. One overwhelming fact that comes through is that people, whatever the color of their skin, don’t understand how to behave around cops so as to keep themselves safe. People have to stop resisting arrest. This may seem obvious, but judging from most of these videos, and from the public reaction to them, this must be a totally arcane piece of information. When a cop wants to take you into custody, you don’t get to decide whether or not you should be arrested. When a cop wants to take you into custody, for whatever reason, it’s not a negotiation. And if you turn it into a wrestling match, you’re very likely to get injured or killed.</p>
<p>This is a point I once belabored in a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/racism-and-violence-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast with Glenn Loury</a>, and it became essentially a public service announcement. And I’ve gone back and listened to those comments, and I want to repeat them here. This is something that everyone really needs to understand. And it’s something that Black Lives Matter should be teaching explicitly: If you put your hands on a cop—if you start wrestling with a cop, or grabbing him because he’s arresting your friend, or pushing him, or striking him, or using your hands in way that can possibly be interpreted as your reaching for a gun—you are likely to get shot in the United States, whatever the color of your skin.</p>
<p>As I said, when you’re with a cop, there is always a gun out in the open. And any physical struggle has to be perceived by him as a fight for the gun. A cop doesn’t know what you’re going to do if you overpower him, so he has to assume the worst. Most cops are not confident in their ability to physically control a person without shooting him—for good reason, because they’re not well trained to do that, and they’re continually confronting people who are bigger, or younger, or more athletic, or more aggressive than they are. Cops are not superheroes. They’re ordinary people with insufficient training, and once things turn physical they cannot afford to give a person who is now assaulting a police officer the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>This is something that most people seem totally confused about. If they see a video of somebody trying to punch a cop in the face and the person’s unarmed, many people think the cop should just punch back, and any use of deadly force would be totally disproportionate. But that’s not how violence works. It’s not the cop’s job to be the best bare-knuckled boxer on Earth so he doesn’t have to use his gun. A cop can’t risk getting repeatedly hit in the face and knocked out, because there’s always a gun in play. This is the cop’s perception of the world, and it’s a justifiable one, given the dynamics of human violence.</p>
<p>You might think cops shouldn’t carry guns. Why can’t we just be like England? That’s a point that can be debated. But it requires considerable thought in a country where there are over 300 million guns on the street. The United States is not England.</p>
<p>Again, really focus on what is happening when a cop is attempting to arrest a person. It’s not up to you to decide whether or not you should be arrested. Does it matter that you know you didn’t do anything wrong? No. And how could that fact be effectively communicated in the moment by your not following police commands? I’m going to ask that again: How could the fact that you’re innocent, that you’re not a threat to cop, that you’re not about to suddenly attack him or produce a weapon of your own, how could those things be effectively communicated at the moment he’s attempting to arrest you by your resisting arrest?</p>
<p>Unless you called the cops yourself, you never know what situation you’re in. If I’m walking down the street, I don’t know if the cop who is approaching me didn’t get a call that some guy who looks like Ben Stiller just committed an armed robbery. I know I didn’t do anything, but I don’t know what’s in the cop’s head. The time to find out what’s going on—the time to complain about racist cops, the time to yell at them and tell them they’re all going to get fired for their stupidity and misconduct—is after cooperating, at the police station, in the presence of a lawyer, preferably. But to not comply in the heat of the moment, when a guy with the gun is issuing commands—this raises your risk astronomically, and it’s something that most people, it seems, just do not intuitively understand, even when they’re not in the heat of the moment themselves, but just watching video of other people getting arrested.</p>
<p>Ok. End of public-service announcement.</p>
<p>The main problem with using individual cases, where black men and women have been killed by cops, to conclude that there is an epidemic of racist police violence in our society, is that you can find nearly identical cases of white suspects being killed by cops, and there are actually more of them.</p>
<p>In 2016, John McWhorter wrote a <a href="https://time.com/4404987/police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> in Time Magazine about this.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of what he wrote:</p>
<p>“The heart of the indignation over these murders is a conviction that racist bias plays a decisive part in these encounters. That has seemed plausible to me, and I have recently challenged those who disagree to present a list of white people killed within the past few years under circumstances similar to those that so enrage us in cases such as what happened to Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Walter Scott, Sam Debose, and others.”</p>
<p>So, McWhorter issued that challenge, as he said, and he was presented with the cases [<a href="https://youtu.be/EPxNUKw0kV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/VBUUx0jUKxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6KhRcIOuurI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]. But there’s no song about these people, admonishing us to say their names. And the list of white names is longer, and I don’t know any of them, other than Tony Timpa. I know the black names. In addition to the ones I just read from McWhorter’s article, I know the names of Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, and Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile, and now, of course, I know the name of George Floyd. And I’m aware of many of the details of these cases where black men and women have been killed by cops. I know the name of Breonna Taylor. I can’t name a single white person killed by cops in circumstances like these—other than Timpa—and I just read McWhorter’s article where he lists many of them.</p>
<p>So, this is also a distortion in the media. The media is not showing us videos of white people being killed by cops; activists are not demanding that they do this. I&#8217;m sure white supremacists talk about this stuff a lot, who knows? But in terms of the story we&#8217;re telling ourselves in the mainstream, we are not actually talking about the data on lethal police violence.</p>
<p>So back to the data: Again, cops kill around 1000 people every year in the United States. About 25 percent are black. About 50 percent are white. The data on police homicide are all over the place. The federal government does not have a single repository for data of this kind. But they have been pretty carefully tracked by outside sources, like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, for the last 5 years. These ratios appear stable over time. Again, many of these killings are justifiable, we’re talking about career criminals who are often armed and, in many cases, trying to kill the cops. Those aren’t the cases we’re worried about. We’re worried about the unjustifiable homicides.</p>
<p>Now, some people will think that these numbers still represent an outrageous injustice. Afterall, African Americans are only 13 percent of the population. So, at most, they should be 13 percent of the victims of police violence, not 25 percent. Any departure from the baseline population must be due to racism.</p>
<p>Ok. Well, that sounds plausible, but consider a few more facts:</p>
<p>Blacks are 13 percent of the population, but they commit <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 50 percent</a> of the murders and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883">other violent crimes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have 13 percent of the population responsible for 50 percent of the murders—and in some cities committing 2/3rds of all violent crime—what percent of police attention should it attract? I don’t know. But I’m pretty sure it’s not just 13 percent. Given that the overwhelming majority of their victims are black, I’m pretty sure that most black people wouldn’t set the dial at 13 percent either.</p>
<p>And here we arrive at the core of the problem. The story of crime in America is overwhelmingly the story of black-on-black crime. It is also, in part, a story of black-on-white crime. For more than a generation, crime in America really hasn’t been a story of much white-on-black crime. [Some listeners mistook my meaning here. I&#8217;m not denying that most violent crime is intraracial. So, it&#8217;s true that most white homicide victims are killed by white offenders. Per capita, however, the white crime rate is much lower than the black crime rate. And there is more black-on-white crime than white-on-black crime.—SH]</p>
<p>The murder rate has come down steadily since the early 1990’s, with only minor upticks. But, nationwide, blacks are still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 times more likely</a> to get murdered than whites, and in some cities their risk is double that. And <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/wiener/programs/pcj/files/PoliceandPublicDiscourseBlackonBlackViolence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 95 percent</a> of the murders are committed by members of the African American community. [While reported in 2015, these data were more than a decade old. Looking at more recent data from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI’s Uniform Crime Report</a>, the number appears to be closer to 90 percent.—SH]</p>
<p>The weekend these protests and riots were kicking off nationwide—when our entire country seemed to be tearing itself apart over a perceived epidemic of racist police violence against the black community, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-sees-18-homicides-deadliest-day-60-years/story?id=71150234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">92 people were shot, and 27 killed</a>, in Chicago alone—one city. This is almost entirely a story of black men killing members of their own community. And this is far more representative of the kind of violence that the black community needs to worry about. And, ironically, it’s clear that one remedy for this violence is, or would be, effective policing.</p>
<p>These are simply the facts of crime in our society as we best understand them. And the police have to figure out how to respond to these facts, professionally and ethically. The question is, are they doing that? And, obviously, there’s considerable doubt that they&#8217;re doing that, professionally and ethically.</p>
<p>Roland Fryer, the Harvard economist who’s work I discussed on the podcast with Glenn Loury, studied police encounters involving black and white suspects and the use of force.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> is titled, this from 2016, “An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force.”</p>
<p>Fryer is black, and he went into this research with the expectation that the data would confirm that there’s an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at black men. But he didn’t find that. However, he did find support for the suspicion that black people suffer more nonlethal violence at the hands of cops than whites do.</p>
<p>So let’s look at this.</p>
<p>The study examined data from 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida and California. Generally, Fryer found that there is 25 percent greater likelihood that the police would go hands on black suspects than white ones—cuffing them, or forcing them to ground, or using other non-lethal force.</p>
<p>Specifically, in New York City, in encounters where white and black citizens were matched for other characteristics, they found that:</p>
<p>Cops were…</p>
<ul>
<li>17 percent more likely to go hands on black suspects</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them into a wall</li>
<li>16 percent more likely to put them in handcuffs (in a situation in which they aren&#8217;t arrested)</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them to the ground</li>
<li>25 percent more likely to use pepper spray or a baton</li>
<li>19 percent more likely to draw their guns</li>
<li>24 percent more likely to point a gun at them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more or less the full continuum of violence short of using lethal force. And it seems, from the data we have, that blacks receive more of it than whites. What accounts for this disparity? Racism? Maybe. However, as I said, it’s inconvenient to note that other data suggest that black cops and Hispanic cops are more likely to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. I’m not sure how an ambient level of racism explains that.</p>
<p>Are there other explanations? Well, again, could it be that blacks are less cooperative with the police. If so, that’s worth understanding. A culture of resisting arrest would be a very bad thing to cultivate, given that the only response to such resistance is for the police to increase their use of force.</p>
<p>Whatever is true here is something we should want to understand. And it’s all too easy to see how an increased number of encounters with cops, due to their policing in the highest crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black, and an increased number of traffic stops in those neighborhoods, and an increased propensity for cops to go hands-on these suspects, with or without an arrest, for whatever reason—it’s easy to see how all of this could be the basis for a perception of racism, whether or not racism is the underlying motivation.</p>
<p>It is totally humiliating to be arrested or manhandled by a cop. And, given the level of crime in the black community, a disproportionate number of innocent black men seem guaranteed to have this experience. It’s totally understandable that this would make them bitter and mistrustful of the police. This is another vicious circle that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>But Fryer also found that black suspects are around 25 percent less likely to be shot than white suspects are. And in the most egregious situations, where officers were not first attacked, but nevertheless fired their weapons at a suspect, they were more likely to do this when the suspect was white.</p>
<p>Again, the data are incomplete. This doesn’t not cover every city in the country. And a larger study tomorrow might paint a different picture. But, as far as I know, the best data we have suggest that for, whatever reason, whites are more likely to be killed by cops once an arrest is attempted. And a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more recent study</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  by David Johnson and colleagues found similar results. And it is simply undeniable that more whites are killed by cops each year, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to their contributions to crime and violence in our society.</p>
<p>Can you hear how these facts should be grinding in that well-oiled machine of woke outrage? Our society is in serious trouble now. We are being crushed under the weight of a global pandemic and our response to it has been totally inept. On top of that, we’re being squeezed by the growing pressure of what might become a full-on economic depression. And the streets are now filled with people who imagine, on the basis of seeing some horrific videos, that there is an epidemic of racist cops murdering African Americans. Look at what this belief is doing to our politics. And these videos will keep coming. And the truth is they could probably be matched 2 for 1 with videos of white people being killed by cops. What percentage of people protesting understand that the disparity runs this way? In light of the belief that the disparity must run the other way, people are now quite happy to risk getting beaten and arrested by cops themselves, and to even loot and burn businesses. And most people and institutions are supporting this civil unrest from the sidelines, because they too imagine that cops are killing black people in extraordinary numbers. And all of this is calling forth an authoritarian response from Trump—and leading to more examples of police violence caught on video.</p>
<p>As I hope I’ve made clear, we need police reform—there’s no question about this. And some of the recent footage of the police attacking peaceful protests is outrageous. Nothing I just said should signify that I’m unaware of that. From what I’ve seen—and by the time I release this podcast, the character of all this might have changed—but, from what I’ve seen, the police were dangerously passive in the face of looting and real crime, at least in the beginning. In many cities, they just stood and watched society unravel. And then they were far too aggressive in the face of genuinely peaceful protests. This is a terrible combination. It is the worst combination. There’s no better way to increase cynicism and anger and fear, on all sides.</p>
<p>But racializing how we speak about the problem of police violence, where race isn’t actually the relevant variable—again, think of Tony Timpa— this has highly negative effects. First, it keeps us from talking about the real problems with police tactics. For instance, we had the recent case of Breonna Taylor who was killed in a so-called “no knock” raid of her home. As occasionally happens, in this carnival of moral error we call “the war on drugs,” the police had the wrong address, and they kicked in the wrong door. And they wound up killing a totally innocent woman. But this had nothing to do with race. The problem is not, as some commentators have alleged, that it’s not safe to be “sleeping while black.” The problem is that these no-knock raids are an obscenely dangerous way of enforcing despicably stupid laws. White people die under precisely these same circumstances, and very likely in greater numbers (I don’t have data specifically on no-knock raids, but we can assume that the ratio is probably conserved here).</p>
<p>Think about how crazy this policy is in a nation where gun ownership is so widespread. If someone kicks in your door in the middle of the night, and you’re a gun owner, of course you’re going to reach for your gun. That’s why you have a gun in the first place. The fact that people bearing down on you and your family out of the darkness might have yelled “police” (or might have not yelled “police”; it’s alleged in some of these cases that they don’t yell anything)—the fact that someone yells “police” isn’t necessarily convincing. Anyone can yell “police.” And, again, think of the psychology of this: If the police have the wrong house, and you know there is no reason on earth that real cops would take an interest in you, especially in the middle of the night, because you haven’t done anything (you’re not the guy running a meth lab)—and now you’re reaching for your gun in the dark—of course, someone is likely to get killed. This is not a racial issue. It’s a terrible policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process of police reform isn’t straightforward—and it is made massively more complicated by what’s happening now. Yes, we will be urging police reform in a very big way now, that much seems clear. But Roland Fryer <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also shown</a> that investigations of the cops, in a climate where viral videos and racial politics are operating, have dramatic effects, many of which are negative.</p>
<p>He studied the aftermath of the investigations into police misconduct that followed the killings Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, and Lequan McDonald, and found that, for reasons that seem pretty easy to intuit, proactive police contact with civilians decreases drastically, sometimes by as much 100 percent, once these investigations get started. This is now called “The Ferguson Effect.” The police still answer 911 calls, but they don’t investigate suspicious activity in the same way. They don’t want to wind up on YouTube. And when they alter their behavior like this, homicides go up. Fryer estimates that the effects of these few investigations translated into 1000 extra homicides, and almost 40,000 more felonies, over the next 24 months in the US. And, of course, most of the victims of those crimes were black. One shudders to imagine the size of the Ferguson effect we’re about to see nationwide… I’m sure the morale among cops has never been lower. I think it’s almost guaranteed that cops by the thousands will be leaving the force. And it will be much more difficult to recruit good people.</p>
<p>Who is going to want to be a cop now? Who could be idealist about occupying that role in society? It seems to me that the population of people who will become cops now will be more or less indistinguishable from the population of people who become prison guards. I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s a difference there, and I think we&#8217;re likely to see that difference expressed in the future. It&#8217;s a grim picture, unless we do something very creative here.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a real question about how we can reform police departments, and get rid of bad cops, without negatively impacting the performance of good cops? That’s a riddle we have to solve—or at least we have to understand what the trade-offs are here.</p>
<p>Why is all of this happening now? Police killings of civilians have gone way down. And they are rare events. They are 1/10,000 level events, if measured by arrests. 1/50-60,000 level events if measured by police encounters. And the number of unarmed people who are killed is smaller still. Around 50 last year, again, more were white than black. And not all unarmed victims are innocent. Some get killed in the act of attacking the cops.  [<a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/05/19/breaking-officer-involved-shooting-in-buckingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/officer-involved-shooting-in-adair-county-oklahoma/527-e8cdc435-dcd0-429c-962f-b2c82c22068e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article36802032.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>]</p>
<p>Again, the data don’t tell a clean story, or the whole story. I see no reason to doubt that blacks get more attention from the cops—though, honestly, given the distribution of crime in our society, I don’t know what the alternative to that would be. And once the cops get involved, blacks are more likely to get roughed up, which is bad. But, again, it simply isn’t clear that racism is the cause. And contrary to everyone’s expectations, whites seem more likely to get killed by cops. Actually, one factor seems to be that whites are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 times more likely</a> to commit “suicide by cop” (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 times more likely</a> to commit suicide generally). What’s going on there? Who knows?</p>
<p>There’s a lot we don’t understand about these data. But ask yourself, would our society seem less racist if the disparity ran the other way? Is less physical contact, but a greater likelihood of getting shot and killed a form of white privilege? Is a higher level of suicide by cop, and suicide generally, a form of white privilege? We have a problem here that, read either way, you can tell a starkly racist narrative.</p>
<p>We need ethical, professional policing, of course. But the places with the highest crime in our society need the most of it. Is there any doubt about that? In a city like Milwaukee, blacks are 12 times more likely to get murdered than whites [Not sure where I came by this number, probably a lecture or podcast. It appears the rate is closer to <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/01/12/gun-homicides-milwaukee-has-two-thirds-of-states-gun-killings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 times more likely</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/07/13/residential-segregation-associated-with-black-white-disparity-in-firearm-homicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 times more likely</a> in Wisconsin as a whole—SH], again, they are being killed by other African Americans, nearly 100 percent of the time. I think the lowest figure I’ve seen is 93 percent of the time. [As noted above, more recent data suggest that it’s closer to 90 percent]. What should the police do about this? And what are they likely to do now that our entire country has been convulsed over one horrific case of police misconduct?</p>
<p>We need to lower the temperature on this conversation, and many other conversations, and understand what is actually happening in our society.</p>
<p>But instead of doing this, we now have a whole generation of social activists who seem eager to play a game of chicken with the forces of chaos. Everything I said about the problem of inequality and the need for reform stands. But I think that what we are witnessing in our streets, and on social media, and even in the mainstream press, is a version of mass hysteria. And the next horrific video of a black person being killed by cops won’t be evidence to the contrary. And there will be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a>. There are 10 million arrests every year. There will always be another video.</p>
<p>And the media has turned these videos into a form of political pornography. And this has deranged us. We’re now unable to speak or even think about facts. The media has been poisoned by bad incentives, in this regard, and social media doubly so.</p>
<p>In the mainstream of this protest movement, it’s very common to hear that the only problem with what is happening in our streets, apart from what the cops are doing, is that some criminal behavior at the margins—a little bit of looting, a little bit of violence—has distracted us from an otherwise necessary and inspiring response to an epidemic of racism. Most people in the media have taken exactly this line. People like Anderson Cooper on CNN or the editorial page of the New York Times or public figures like President Obama or Vice President Biden. The most prominent liberal voices believe that the protests themselves make perfect moral and political sense, and that movements like Black Lives Matter are guaranteed to be on the right side of history. How could anyone who is concerned about inequality and injustice in our society see things any other way? How could anyone who isn’t himself racist not support Black Lives Matter?</p>
<p>But, of course, there’s a difference between slogans and reality. There’s a difference between the branding of a movement and its actual aims. And this can be genuinely confusing. That’s why propaganda works. For instance, many people assume there’s nothing wrong with ANTIFA, because this group of total maniacs has branded itself as “anti-fascist.” What could be wrong with being anti-fascist? Are you pro fascism?</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem with Black Lives Matter—though, happily, unlike ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter actually seems committed to peaceful protest, which is hugely important. So the problem I’m discussing is more ideological, and it’s much bigger than Black Lives Matter—though BLM is its most visible symbol of this movement. The wider issue is that we are in the midst of a public hysteria and moral panic. And it has been made possible by a near total unwillingness, particularly on the Left, among people who value their careers and their livelihoods and their reputations, and fear being hounded into oblivion online—this is nearly everyone left-of-center politically. People are simply refusing to speak honestly about the problem of race and racism in America.</p>
<p>We are making ourselves sick. We are damaging our society. And by protesting the wrong thing, even the slightly wrong thing, and unleashing an explosion of cynical criminality in the process—looting that doesn’t even have the pretense of protest—the Left is empowering Trump, whatever the polls currently show. And if we are worried about Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, as I think we really should be, this is important to understand. He recently had what looked like paramilitary troops guarding the White House. I don’t know if we found out who those guys actually were, but that was genuinely alarming. But how are Democrats calls to “abolish the police” going to play to half the country that just watched so many cities get looted? We have to vote Trump out of office and restore the integrity of our institutions. And we have to make the political case for major reforms to deal with the problem of inequality—a problem which affects the black community most of all.</p>
<p>We need police reform; we need criminal justice reform; we need tax reform; we need health care reform; we need environmental reform—we need all of these things and more. And to be just, these policies will need to reduce the inequality in our society. If we did this, African Americans would benefit, perhaps more than any other group. But it’s not at all clear that progress along these dimensions primarily entails us finding and eradicating more racism in our society.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, what would real progress on the problem of racism look like? What would utter progress look like?</p>
<p>Here’s what I think it would look like: More and more people (and ultimately all people) would care less and less (and ultimately not at all) about race. As I’ve said before in various places, skin color would become like hair color in its political and moral significance—which is to say that it would have none.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you don’t agree with that aspiration. Maybe you think that tribalism based on skin color can’t be outgrown or shouldn’t be outgrown. Well, if you think that, I’m afraid I don’t know what to say to you. It’s not that there’s nothing to say, it’s just there is so much we disagree about, morally and politically, that I don’t know where to begin. So that debate, if it can even be had, will have to be left for another time.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this conversation, I have to assume that you agree with me about the goal here, which is to say that you share the hope that there will come a time where the color of a person’s skin really doesn’t matter. What would that be like?</p>
<p>Well, how many blondes got into Harvard this year? Does anyone know? What percentage of the police in San Diego are brunette? Do we have enough red heads in senior management in our Fortune 500 companies? No one is asking these questions, and there is a reason for that. No one cares. And we are right not to care.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which people cared about hair color to the degree that we currently care—or seem to care, or imagine that others care, or allege that they secretly care—about skin color. Imagine a world in which discrimination by hair color was a thing, and it took centuries to overcome, and it remains a persistent source of private pain and public grievance throughout society, even where it no longer exists. What an insane misuse of human energy that would be. What an absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p>The analogy isn’t perfect, for a variety of reasons, but it’s good enough for us to understand what life would be like if the spell of racism and anti-racism were truly broken. The future we want is not one in which we have all become passionate anti-racists. It’s not a future in which we are forever on our guard against the slightest insult—the bad joke, the awkward compliment, the tweet that didn’t age well. We want to get to a world in which skin color and other superficial characteristics of a person become morally and politically irrelevant. And if you don’t agree with that, what did you think Martin Luther King Jr was talking about?</p>
<p>And, finally, if you’re on the Left and don’t agree with this vision of a post-racial future, please observe that the people who agree with you, the people who believe that there is no overcoming race, and that racial identity is indissoluble, and that skin color really matters and will always matter—these people are white supremacists and neo-Nazis and other total assholes. And these are also people I can’t figure out how to talk to, much less persuade.</p>
<p>So the question for the rest of us—those of us who want to build a world populated by human beings, merely—the question is, how do we get there? How does racial difference become uninteresting? Can it become uninteresting by more and more people taking a greater interest in it? Can it become uninteresting by becoming a permanent political identity? Can it become uninteresting by our having thousands of institutions whose funding (and, therefore, very survival) depends on it remaining interesting until the end of the world?</p>
<p>Can it become less significant by being granted more and more significance? By becoming a fetish, a sacred object, ringed on all sides by taboos? Can race become less significant if you can lose your reputation and even your livelihood, at any moment, by saying one wrong word about it?</p>
<p>I think these questions answer themselves. To outgrow our obsession with racial difference, we have outgrow our obsession with race. And you don’t do that by maintaining your obsession with it.</p>
<p>Now, you might agree with me about the goal and about how a post-racial society would seem, but you might disagree about the path to get there—the question of what to do next. In fact, one podcast listener wrote to me recently to say that while he accepted my notion of a post-racial future, he thinks it’s just far too soon to talk about putting racial politics behind us. He asked me to imagine just how absurd it would have been to tell Martin Luther King Jr, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, that the path beyond racism requires that he become less and less obsessed with race.</p>
<p>That seems like a fair point, but Coleman Hughes has drawn my attention to a string of MLK quotes that seem to be just as transcendent of racial identity politics as I’m hoping to be here. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1087593991976243200?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see these quotations</a> on his Twitter feed. None of those statements by King would make sense coming out of Black Lives Matter at the moment.</p>
<p>In any case, as I said, I think we are living in a very different time than Martin Luther King was. And what I see all around me is evidence of the fact that we were paying an intolerable price for confusion about racism, and social justice generally—and the importance of identity, generally—and this is happening in an environment where the path to success and power for historically disadvantaged groups isn’t generally barred by white racists who won&#8217;t vote for them, or hire them, or celebrate their achievements, or buy their products, and it isn’t generally barred by laws and policies and norms that are unfair. There is surely still some of that. But there must be less of it now than there ever was.</p>
<p>The real burden on the black community is the continued legacy of inequality—with respect to wealth, and education, and health, and social order—levels of crime, in particular, and resulting levels of incarceration, and single-parent families—and it seems very unlikely that these disparities, whatever their origin in the past, can be solved by focusing on problem of lingering racism, especially where it doesn&#8217;t exist. And the current problem of police violence seems a perfect case in point.</p>
<p>And yet now we’re inundated with messages from every well-intentioned company and organization singing from the same book of hymns. Black Lives Matter is everywhere. Of course, black lives matter. But the messaging of this movement about the reality of police violence is wrong, and it’s creating a public hysteria.</p>
<p>I just got a message from the American Association for the Advancement of Science talking about fear of the other. The quote from the email: “Left unchecked, racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of the other can enter any organization or community – and destroy the foundations upon which we must build our future.” Ok, fine. But is that really the concern in the scientific community right now, “unchecked racism, sexism, and homophobia.” Is that really what ails science in the year 2020? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you the fear of the other that does seem warranted, everywhere, right now. It&#8217;s the other who has rendered him or herself incapable of dialogue. It’s the other who will not listen to reason, who has no interest in facts, who can&#8217;t join a conversation that converges on the truth, because he knows in advance what the truth must be. We should fear the other who thinks that dogmatism and cognitive bias aren’t something to be corrected for, because they’re the very foundations of his epistemology.  We should fear the other who can&#8217;t distinguish activism from journalism or politics from science. Or worse, can make these distinctions, but refuses to. And we’re all capable of becoming this person. If only for minutes or hours at a time. And this is a bug in our operating system, not a feature. We have to continually correct for it.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking things that many of us learned when the Covid-19 pandemic was first landing on our shores, and we were weighing the pros and cons of closing the schools, was that for tens of millions of American kids, going to school represents the only guarantee of a decent meal on any given day. I’m pretty confident that most of the kids we’re talking about here aren’t white. And whatever you think about the opportunities in this country and whatever individual success stories you can call to mind, there is no question that some of us start on third base, or second base. Everyone has a lot to deal with, of course. Life is hard. But not everyone is a single mom, or single grandparent, struggling to raise kids in the inner city, all the while trying to keep them from getting murdered. The disparities in our society are absolutely heartbreaking and unacceptable. And we need to have a rational discussion about their actual causes and solutions.</p>
<p>We have to pull back from the brink here. And all we have with which to do that is conversation. And the only thing that makes conversation possible is an openness to evidence and arguments—a willingness to update one’s view of the world when better reasons are given. And that is an ongoing process, not a place we ever finally arrive.</p>
<p>Ok… Well, perhaps that was more of an exhortation than I intended, but it certainly felt like I needed to say it. I hope it was useful. And the conversations will continue on this podcast.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear Making Sense and Waking Up subscribers—</p>
<p>Those of you who have been listening to my podcast or following me on Twitter know that I’m quite worried about the emerging coronavirus pandemic. Barring some extraordinarily good luck, I believe that we have some very rough months ahead of us. Health concerns aside, it now seems inevitable that we will experience considerable economic uncertainty as a wave of illness disrupts normal life in a hundred countries simultaneously.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://samharris.org/thoughts-implosion-pangburn-philosophy/">A few thoughts on the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As many of you know, the Day of Reflection conference, scheduled for November 17 in NYC, has been cancelled, and some hundreds of ticket holders are now left seeking refunds.</p>
<p>I was forced to pull out of this event <a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/1043277230632132608">nearly two months ago</a> and have said very little about it since. Now that Travis Pangburn has officially announced that he will be <a href="https://twitter.com/PangburnInspire/status/1062431248205864962">“folding” his touring company</a>, Pangburn Philosophy, I can give a brief account of what happened.</p>
<ol>
<li>I participated in 10 events organized by Pangburn Philosophy between September 2017 and July 2018. I didn’t always approve of the way those events were staged or marketed, but all of them appeared to be successful.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>However, after the cancellation of an August 2018 conference in Auckland, Pangburn seemed intent on running his business off a cliff. He owed a lot of money to several speakers at that point, in the form of unpaid fees and reimbursements. Most egregiously, he seemed less than fully committed to refunding ticket holders for the cancelled Auckland conference.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>At this point, I had two more dates on the calendar with Pangburn in 2018: a dialogue with Brian Greene in Toronto (September 5) and the Day of Reflection conference in New York (November 17). I kept my appointment in Toronto because I was contractually obligated to do so. I also didn’t want to do anything that would harm Pangburn’s ability to pay his mounting debts.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>After Toronto, however, it became clear that Pangburn could not be trusted to put his house in order. Facing a total lack of transparency, and realizing that Pangburn was using my ongoing association with him to book future speakers, I withdrew from the NYC conference on September 21 (as well as from a Vancouver conference scheduled for March 2019). Legally, I was able to do this because Pangburn was in breach of my speaking contract. Ethically, I had a far more compelling reason to back out: I couldn’t promote or participate in an event for which I believed other speakers were unlikely to get paid; nor could I continue to work with someone who still hadn’t given refunds to ticket holders for a conference that had been canceled more than a month before.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>After I withdrew from the NYC conference, my management team asked Pangburn to give us the email addresses of all ticket holders so that we could notify them that I was no longer involved with the event. Pangburn refused to provide this information. However, he assured us that he would notify everyone himself. (I do not know whether he ever did.) He then stopped responding to our emails.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>At the time I pulled out of the NYC conference, I assumed that the revenue from ticket sales was still safely in the box office and that Pangburn would be obliged to issue refunds should the conference fail. That’s how things normally work, especially at a reputable venue like Lincoln Center. It hadn’t occurred to me that New York ticketholders might suffer the same fate as those in Auckland.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>I was left with a legal and ethical puzzle that I could not solve. Again, I had no way to communicate with ticket holders directly, and discussing the chaos surrounding Pangburn on my podcast never seemed like an option. Several friends and colleagues still had events on the calendar with him, and I didn’t want to do anything to derail them. In addition, many speakers who were aware of my reasons for pulling out of the NYC conference were still signed on and seemed intent on making it work. I couldn’t see anything to do that wouldn’t risk creating further harms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Pangburn still owes several speakers (including me) an extraordinary amount of money, we were willing to participate in the NYC conference for free as recently as a few days ago, if he would have handed it over to us and stepped away. I have been told that this offer was made, and he declined it.</p>
<p>I find it appalling that so many people were needlessly harmed by the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy. I can assure you that every speaker associated with the NYC event will be much wiser when working with promoters in the future.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>

<blockquote><p>PRESS RELEASE MARCH 12 2013</p>
<p>Catholic Church&#8217;s Rights to &#8220;The Work of God&#8221; Stand Trial</p>
<p>On Friday, presumably immediately after a new Pope has been elected, The Danish High Maritime &amp; Commercial Court of Denmark, will make a historical verdict upon who has the rights to use the age old philosophical &amp; theological concept of &#8220;opus dei&#8221; (The Work of God).</p>
<p>The former Pope&#8217;s personal Prelature has claimed sole rights to the concept since the 1980s, right up until it was inevitably challenged by the small Danish card game publishing house, Dema Games, when they registered (and had officially approved), their trademark: &#8220;Opus-Dei: Existence After Religion&#8221;. A name that has &#8220;everything to do with the philosophical connotations, and nothing to do with the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei&#8221; , Managing Director, Mark Rees-Andersen says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dema Games, and their Pro Bono lawyer Janne Glæsel from the prestigious Copenhagen-based law firm, Gorrissen Federspiel, has chosen to counter-sue the Prelature, which now might lose their rights to their EU-trademark, which due to EU-law, the Danish court has authority to make rulings on behalf of.  The sue was an immediate media security event.  Federspiel was last seen with a team of <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-york-city-guard-services/">event security Manhattan</a> escorting him due to this new law.  In effect, he has his own concierge security service.</p>
<p>Why the sub-division of the Catholic Church may lose their rights, is mainly due to the argument, that the Prelature&#8217;s registration was invalid from the very beginning, as no one can legally monopolize religious concepts. The church has since stepped up security and started<span style="color: #222222;"> monitoring specific or heightened terrorist threats or alerts. Since then a security team from <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration:inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-yorkfire-safety-management/">VIP Protection New York City</a> patrols the outside.  Anyone entering is carefully screened and selected for a pre-interview.</span></p>
<p>The case has been ongoing for four years, and Mark Rees-Andersen has singlehandedly successfully defended his legal rights to his game&#8217;s website in 2009, at Nominet, the authority of domain-rights issues in the UK. Dema Games remains to have ownership of the hyphenated &#8220;opus-dei&#8221; domain, in Denmark, Great Britain, France, Poland, Switzerland, and Sweden.</p>
