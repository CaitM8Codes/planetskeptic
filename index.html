            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Now my brain is stuck on spider evolution, which is an awesomely cool subject, and how annoyed I am that creationists can spit on it with such ignorant contempt.  So I have to mention another good article on the subject, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/5229.long">Reconstructing web evolution and spider diversification in the molecular era</a>. There are so many papers on this topic, and there&#8217;s a guy affiliated with the Discovery Institute writing a whole book on the subject while unforgivably ignorant of it all. So here, cogitate on this:</p>
<div id="attachment_64836" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/molecularwebs-500x663.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="663" class="size-large wp-image-64836" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/molecularwebs-500x663.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/molecularwebs-113x150.jpg 113w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/molecularwebs-226x300.jpg 226w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/molecularwebs-768x1019.jpg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/molecularwebs.jpg 965w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Optimization of web architecture on the preferred topology. Black stars indicate strong support for a node from both MP (jackknife > 75%) and Bayesian (posterior probabilities > 90%) analyses, and gray stars indicate nodes strongly supported only by one methodology or with jackknife 50–74%. Branch colors represent MP reconstruction of webs, and pie charts represent the relative probabilities from ML reconstructions. Colors of boxes to the left of taxon names represent their webs, and open boxes indicate that taxa do not spin prey capture webs.</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s also information on the topic of orb web monophyly that I mentioned in the <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/12/11/this-cannot-be-tolerated-creationists-lying-about-spider-evolution/">previous post</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The monophyletic origin of orb webs is strongly supported, despite conspicuous differences in the silk used to spin different types of orbs. This has important implications for understanding both web evolution and spider diversification. Instead of cribellate and ecribellate orb webs evolving in parallel, orb monophyly explicitly implies that dry cribellate capture spirals were replaced by ecribellate gluey spirals. This involves 2 major changes. First, a shift in the silk used to produce the core fibers of capture threads, resulting in novel tensile properties. The core fibers of modern (ecribellate) orb weavers are composed of flagelliform silk, which is much more elastic than the pseudoflagelliform silk core fibers of cribellate spiders. Mechanically, flagelliform silk functions like rubber, relying on entropy to resist motion of silk molecules and absorb kinetic energy during prey capture, allowing the capture spiral to expand and contract repeatedly. In contrast, cribellate silk relies on permanent rupturing of molecular bonds to absorb kinetic energy and deforms irreversibly during prey capture. The second major shift involves the mechanism of adhesion, from dry cribellate fibrils that adhere through van der Waals forces and hygroscopic interactions to chemically adhesive viscid glue in ecribellate spiders. This results in webs with greater adhesion per surface area and may have facilitated the transition from horizontal to vertical web orientation in modern orb spiders, which is associated with increased prey interception rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>That paper also discusses something I didn&#8217;t mention. Did you know that about half of all spider species don&#8217;t make prey capture webs at all? They&#8217;re active hunters, like wolf spiders and jumping spiders, and they belong to an extremely successful monophyletic group called the RTA clade, short for retrolateral tibial apophysis, the best band name ever.</p>
<p>I think I need to go spend some time in the lab with my spiders to cool my brain down, before participating in the <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/fundraising/">podcast this afternoon</a>, which will not be about spiders.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. The Discovery Institute has turned it&#8217;s puerile, feeble attention to <em>spiders</em> now, and it&#8217;s as pathetic as you might imagine. It&#8217;s written by a guy, Eric Cassell, who felt it important to mention that he had an undergraduate biology degree, which  he earned at least four decades ago, before committing to work in &#8212; take a wild guess &#8212; <em>engineering</em>, of course. Much as I respect many engineers and their work, it sure tends to breed inappropriate teleological attitudes in the brains of its practitioners.</p>
<p>This article, <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/12/the-miracle-of-spiderwebs/" rel='nofollow'>The Miracle of Spiderwebs</a>, is typical of the type. First, talk about how <em>freakin&#8217; complicated</em> spider webs are, then declare that they don&#8217;t understand how they could have evolved, which therefore means it could not have evolved. Never mind that spiders have been dependent on silk for their survival for 350 million years and there has been constant selection for more effective functionality, some old guy with negligible background in biology can&#8217;t understand it! Furthermore, it can&#8217;t possibly be because he&#8217;s an ignorant ass, he has to misrepresent the current science to make his case.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Despite great effort, humans have yet to produce anything functionally equivalent to silk. Through genetic engineering, attempts have been made to duplicate it without success. The main challenge is replicating the sophisticated and information-rich protein molecules found in the silk produced by spiders and other silk-producing arthropods such as silkworms — proteins that are nearly double the size of average human proteins. Smaller proteins do not have the strength or flexibility of spider silk. Given the advanced genetic and manufacturing technologies available today, it is remarkable that spider silk still cannot be duplicated. This illustrates just how advanced the engineering design of spider silk is.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, he&#8217;s wrong. The silk molecules tend to be long, but not particularly &#8220;information-rich&#8221;, whatever that means. They are made up of long stretches of highly repetitive amino acid sequences, interspersed with special purpose regions. The strength comes from the repetition &#8212; they fold into crystalline bricks made of beta-pleated sheets. The length of each molecule is an obstacle to synthesizing them, of course, but there&#8217;s nothing magical or incomprehensible about the genes.</p>
<p>Rather, what makes them difficult to replicate is the silk production apparatus. The silk gland stores a large quantity of the fluid suspension of the silk molecules, but to make a silk fiber requires passage through a long duct that physically compresses and stretches the fibers as it extracts water and acidifies the environment, causing a controlled phase transition that makes the silk molecules align and precipitate to build a continuous fiber. That&#8217;s the hard part. It&#8217;s the gene (relatively easy) plus the specific mechanical and chemical processing that makes the silk. It is not at all remarkable that we can&#8217;t duplicate that process, but there&#8217;s nothing divine about it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all there is to this article. Gosh, it&#8217;s amazing what biology can accomplish, says the guy who thinks it&#8217;s all about engineering.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Various spiderwebs, even among spiders of the same species, are far from identical. The most obvious reason for the differences is that each is tailored to its specific location. As the Goulds explain, “Every set of initial anchor points is different; the number of radii is contingent on opportunity; the beginning of the sticky spiral depends on where the longest several radii turn out to be. In short, each web is a custom production.” The Goulds postulate that spiders have a form of mapping ability that enables them to implement general design principles in a wide variety of circumstances. This is demonstrated, for instance, by spiders successfully making repairs to damaged webs.</p></blockquote>
<p>And…? So…? The reason every web is a custom production is that nature is not uniform. A spider has an algorithm for navigating a variable environment: an orb weaver lays down radial lines from a central point to convenient anchor points, then walks a spiral, laying down sticky threads. The process builds a recognizable, functional sheet that varies depending on structures in the neighborhood. What is the miracle here?</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Providing credible evolutionary explanations for the origin of silk and web design has proven problematic. Several theories have been proposed for the origin of both, but none have been generally accepted. Biologist and spider specialist William Shear concedes that “a functional explanation for the origins of silk and the spinning habit may be impossible to achieve.” One complicating factor is that the webs of some spiders that are more distantly related are nearly identical. Shear writes, “It appears probable that several web types are the product of convergent evolution — that is, that the same web has evolved in unrelated species that have adapted to similar environmental circumstances.” But as I will argue in Chapter 6, that is an unconvincing explanation for the origin of complex programmed behaviors. </p></blockquote>
<p>For someone cited by a creationist, WA Shear sure has a lot of publications on the paleontology and evolution of spiders and other invertebrates. It looks like his work might have been mined to extract a misleading quote, and yep, he sure has.</p>
<p>That brief quote is taken from an article titled, &#8220;Untangling the evolution of the web,&#8221; and surprise, surprise, surprise, the creationist has left out the bulk of the context. I know, a creationist lies about the scientific literature? Say it ain&#8217;t so! But here&#8217;s the full and accurate quote from the paper. It <em>starts</em>, &#8220;A functional explanation for the origins of silk and the spinning habit may be impossible to achieve&#8221;, but then there&#8217;s a goddamn COMMA.</p>
<blockquote><p>A functional explanation for the origins of silk and the spinning habit may be impossible to achieve<strong>,</strong> but the evolution of silk-spinning <em>organs</em> has been studied, and debated, extensively. Revealing <strong>evidence</strong> has come from the histology of silk glands &#8212; the details of their cellular construction &#8212; and from the embryological development of the spinnerets themselves. Histological <strong>evidence</strong> allows us to draw connections, or homologies, between silk glands in different spider groups, and embryology shows clearly that the spinnerets are paired abdominal appendages, with the silk issuing from modified setae, or hairs. So much information is available on the anatomy of the spinning apparatus, in fact, that the traditional view of web evolution rests heavily on a classification derived from the form and position of spinnerets.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of those things about the creationist literature that makes me thoroughly furious: they unethically misrepresent and actively distort the work published in the credible scientific literature to pretend they are scholars. They aren&#8217;t. They&#8217;re liars. And they spin their lies out into collections of self-reinforcing nonsense. I note that the creationist here seems to think that convergent evolution is somehow an unacceptable explanation for the origin of multiple kinds of webs, and cites his <em>own goddamn book</em>, authored by a creationist engineer with no qualifications at all in this field, and ignores the fact that his source, WA Shear, goes on to give a summary of the evolution of diverse webs. That&#8217;s not a book worth reading, obviously.</p>
<p>Also, that Shear article contains a simple, clear illustration of the pattern of evolution that this creationist twit thinks can&#8217;t exist.</p>

The Mesothelae are generally believed to have evolved first from the common ancestor of all spiders, followed by the Mygalomorphae and the &#8220;true spiders&#8221;, the Araneomorphae. The monophyletic hypothesis of orb-web origin (which is incorporated into this diagram) holds that the orb-web was invented by an araneomorph, the common ancestor of araneoid and uloborid spiders, that had a cribellum. The cribellum was acquired by a spider that was the common ancestor of all araneomorphs, including the araneoid superfamily and the uloborids. The araneoids lost the cribellum, and some araneoid families later lost the orb. Among the uloborids and their close relatives, the dinopids, are many species that have modified the orb.</p></div>
<p>But wait! There&#8217;s much more, all conveniently left out of Cassell&#8217;s stupid mangling of the article. We do have good models for the evolution of spider webs, all based on, as Shear notes, the <em>evidence</em> from taxonomy and histology and molecular biology.</p>

Pathways that are less likely are indicated by light-orange arrows; for some of them there is no direct evidence.</p></div>
<p>Oh look. Someone had the proper respect for the evidence and was happy to talk about the strengths and weakness of the support for their model, and it wasn&#8217;t Eric Cassel.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also note that Cassel is relying on a generalist article from 1994 which incorporates little of the evidence from modern molecular phylogenies. He didn&#8217;t understand the 27 year old article, there&#8217;s little hope he could grasp a modern analysis, in which the details of evolution have been strengthened. Here&#8217;s an example from 2012, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038084">Early Events in the Evolution of Spider Silk Genes</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>A more fundamental challenge for those seeking to provide a detailed, causally credible explanation for the origin of silk and spiderweb architecture is the number of genes involved in producing silk, and the complex genomes of spiders. After decades of failed attempts to provide a causally adequate explanation, one can be forgiven for concluding that we have no compelling reason to assume that a step-by-step evolutionary pathway to such an information-rich substrate actually exists. And as we will discuss later, there are now some positive reasons to consider that such information-rich systems have for their source something other than a purely blind material process. Here, suffice it to say that the behaviors and functions associated with both silk and web spinning exhibit many characteristics of human engineering, and engineering of a very high order. </p></blockquote>
<p>Repeat after me:</p>
<p><strong>Complexity is not evidence of design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Complexity is not evidence of design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Complexity is not evidence of design.</strong></p>
<p>Also repeat after me:</p>
<p><strong>My ignorance is not evidence of design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My ignorance is not evidence of design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My ignorance is not evidence of design.</strong></p>
<p>Biologists have provided causally adequate explanations for the origin and evolution of diverse spider webs, Mr Cassell is simply intentionally and maliciously ignoring them, and further, lying about the content of the scientific literature to make a claim that arachnologists are as ignorant as he is. He&#8217;s also logically contradictory.</p>
<p>If, <q>Given the advanced genetic and manufacturing technologies available today, it is remarkable that spider silk still cannot be duplicated</q>, how can you then turn around say that webs <q>exhibit many characteristics of human engineering, and engineering of a very high order</q>?</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="Eimear McBride (Sophie Bassouls)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Eimar_McBride_&copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall.jpg" height="666" alt="Eimar_McBride_&copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall" width="1000" /></em></p> <p><em>Eimear McBride is the author of three novels: &ldquo;A Girl is a Half-formed Thing&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Lesser Bohemians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strange Hotel&rdquo;. She has received a number of awards, including the Goldsmiths Prize and Irish Novel of the Year. McBride recently published &ldquo;Something Out of Place: Women and Disgust&rdquo;, a polemical essay in book form.</em></p> <p><strong>&ldquo;Something Out of Place&rdquo; argues that the contradictory forces of disgust and objectification continue to control women in western culture. Does religion play a part in this? </strong><br /><br />It has its roots in Judaeo-Christian attitudes towards women&rsquo;s bodies. There are many cultural prejudices that have come down to us through biblical ideas that we have since disregarded and decided are no longer useful for contemporary living. But this issue has been transmuted and updated over the generations and continues to take different forms. It&rsquo;s clearly serving a purpose for the patriarchal system that still holds power.</p> <p><strong>You call for an end to shame and taboo. What does this mean in practice? </strong><br /><br />There is still a struggle for women to find a place where their bodies are accepted and allowed to function [naturally]. Women cannot own the experience of their bodies. It&rsquo;s still a badge of honour for a woman to go into work and nobody to know they are having a terrible period. Women are not expected to have a difficult time when they&rsquo;re going through the menopause. That&rsquo;s something that they are supposed to privately talk about in the kitchen! So accepting the realities of the problem of physical experience and normalising it will help women form a more contented relationship with their bodies. <br /><br /><strong>Does this relate to your writing about the female body in metaphorical terms as &ldquo;meat&rdquo;?</strong><br /><br />I borrowed this term from Angela Carter&rsquo;s book <em>The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography</em> (1978). Men&rsquo;s bodies [in our culture] are not seen as meat, but flesh, almost divine, separate and set apart. But women&rsquo;s bodies go through many more changes throughout their lives. This has then been used as a way to condemn women to the place of the animal. Their bodies are seen as a measurement of their humanity, and the mind that inhabits the body is of no consequence. And so women&rsquo;s bodies are treated like pieces of meat.<br /><br /><strong>Does anything give you hope for the future?</strong><br /><br />The progress made in Ireland in recent years has given me hope, like the changes to the abortion law there. I didn&rsquo;t think I would ever see that in my own lifetime. Also, the #MeToo movement made a lot of noise, but I worry that the momentum for real legal change slowed down in the years after that. <br /><br /><strong>You seem to be concerned about the rise of social media and online culture. </strong><br /><br />The arrival of the internet seemed like it was going to open a platform for discussion, but it has instead closed and compartmentalised it. The problem with cancel culture is that it does not look for places to overlap. It&rsquo;s creating a very poisoned public space where people are unable to find their places of connection. It was possible before to argue with people, and that was useful for trying to discover what it was that you believe yourself. It meant you could be open to ideas that you may not have previously even considered. Now people are put into a box, and if you don&rsquo;t agree with every single thing that person does, they&rsquo;re trash. That is a mistake that is going to take a long time to undo.<br /><br /><strong>Pornography is another concern of yours. How can this be addressed? </strong><br /><br />Regulation is one aspect. But there should be a huge amount of education too, especially with teenagers: it really isn&rsquo;t representative of actual adult sexual relationships. There are so many things in porn that are just untruthful. People want to look at other people having sex. That has always been the case. But also, how do you create a situation where people who perform are not being exploited?<br /><br /><strong>Your novels are celebrated for the way they play with language and make use of ambiguity. What attracts you to this style?</strong><br /><br />It&rsquo;s a mixture of many things. I was interested in modernism, especially James Joyce and Samuel Beckett. It also felt that there was a type of experience that was very much underrepresented in contemporary fiction, not just for women, but people in general: life that exists underneath rational thought. It&rsquo;s a very powerful force that influences the decisions we make, how we behave and who we are. It seemed to me that modernism was a tool that could be used to explore that idea. We had been told that the future of the novel lay in social realism. But I felt it was worth going back to modernism and to look at those techniques again and to use them in different ways and describe different kinds of experiences. Fiction has been compartmentalised. But it&rsquo;s possible to be a bit more promiscuous. And that&rsquo;s the pleasure and point of fiction: you write it in order to get to a kind of truth that biography, memoir or journalism won&rsquo;t get you to in understanding what it is to be a person. And everything&rsquo;s fair game when you are doing it.<br /><br /><strong>What other writers have influenced you? </strong><br /><br />Shakespeare, weird Jacobean tragedies, Thomas Mann, Gertrude Stein. To name a few.<br /><br /><strong>The success of your debut novel, &ldquo;A Girl is a Half-formed Thing&rdquo;, came quite late in your career. Did that long struggle put you off writing?</strong><br /><br />After finishing <em>A Girl is a Half-formed Thing</em> I didn&rsquo;t write anything for three years, then I decided to write <em>The Lesser Bohemians</em>. But at that stage, <em>A Girl is A Half-formed Thing</em> was still six years away from being published. Clearly, nobody wanted my writing. And I did wonder: is it right to start another book? But the truth was that I knew that there was nothing else I could ever do with my life. I had a kind of dark night of the soul moment. But being a writer and having a writing career are two different things. And even for successful writers that is also true. The career is often very disruptive to the writing. I kept going even though I thought I was writing into a void. <br /><br /><strong>What makes you want to keep returning to the themes of the female body and the trauma of sexual abuse? </strong><br /><br />Every writer just has the thing that is interesting to them. For me it&rsquo;s been the life of the female body, and what happens to a woman who has experienced sexual violence. But there is a progression [in the books] too. <em>A Girl is A Half-formed Thing</em> is about situating the reader right in the very moment of the abuse, in that complete sort of inferno of suffering that the girl goes through. But <em>The Lesser Bohemians</em> is about what it&rsquo;s like to live after that, many years later. It asks questions like: what is it to be a survivor of abuse when you are alone again in the world and there is nobody putting a hand on you that you don&rsquo;t want? Or how do you live in the world with that history, and what do you then become? Then in <em>Strange Hotel</em> there is an echo of those things in the background. I feel like <em>Strange Hotel</em> has sort of completed that period for me as a writer.<br /><br /><strong>Will your fiction be going in a different direction now? </strong><br /><br />I feel as though each book has its own set of rules and requirements. And with each new book it feels like I&rsquo;m starting again, like I feel like I have to write again from scratch. I don&rsquo;t know if I will be interested to write about sexual abuse again, so explicitly. I feel like that might be over now. But then again, it might not be.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="Somali Refugees in Dolo Ado, Ethiopia (UNHCR Ethiopia/ Somali refugees / J. Ose / June 2012)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Dollo-Addo.jpg" height="900" alt="Dollo-Addo" width="1348" /></em></p> <p><em>Alexander Betts is Professor of Forced Migration and International Affairs at the University of Oxford and author of "The Wealth of Refugees: How Displaced People Can Build Economies" (Oxford University Press), which was published in April.</em></p> <p><strong>1. Your book argues that the likelihood of a long-term refugee presence in host countries around the world is only going to grow as the climate crisis deepens and more people are forced to cross borders. What does this mean for how refugees should be viewed in host countries? </strong></p> <p>We live in an age of displacement. We are going to face rising numbers of refugees but also declining political will to admit asylum seekers. Climate change will exacerbate this trend. But it&rsquo;s worth being aware that most refugees are not in Europe or North America. Eight-five per cent are hosted by low and middle-income countries like Jordan, Uganda, and Colombia, which neighbour conflict and crisis. If refugee protection is to be sustainable then these countries need to view refugees as a benefit rather than simply a burden. In order for that to happen, the rich world has to support these countries, not just by offering humanitarian assistance, but also by providing development assistance. The key is to recognise and build upon the skills, talents, and aspirations of refugees themselves &ndash; to enable receiving societies to see them as contributors. This requires significant investment in job creation and public services like education and health that benefit both refugees and nearby host communities.</p> <p><strong>2. "Self-reliance" programmes of the kind you examine in the book began in Greece in the 1920s for refugees fleeing Ottoman Empire states. What political conditions existed there at the time that made these programmes viable? </strong></p> <p>Self-reliance is the idea that refugees can be empowered to live independently of aid &ndash; for example, by having the right to work and freedom of movement within a host country. Yet too often today, refugee-hosting countries deny refugees access to labour markets and insist they live indefinitely in refugee camps. &ldquo;Self-reliance&rdquo; has taken-off in refuge policy debates, but it is not a new idea. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Greece worked with the League of Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support refugees to work in agriculture across the country. It was able to do this partly because of labour shortages and surplus arable land, partly because many arriving were Greek Orthodox and so welcomed by the receiving society, and partly because Greece enjoyed the support of the international community through the International Labour Organisation (ILO).</p> <p><strong>3. A century on from the early Greek experiment, Dollo Ado in Ethiopia is a model for how refugees and hosts can actually work alongside one another in cooperatives. How does the model work &ndash; and how was it originally sold to the host community? </strong></p> <p>The five Dollo Ado camps were created just over a decade ago to provide sanctuary to Somali refugees fleeing conflict and drought. Despite being in an arid, insecure region with limited infrastructure, they have benefited from an innovative new approach to refugee assistance. The cooperative model offers group-based income-generating activities in areas such as agriculture, livestock, and energy. Half of the members are refugees and half are members of the host community. They have been created through unprecedented private sector investment; the IKEA Foundation has invested over $100m, including in relevant infrastructure such as irrigation. The cooperatives have led to increases in income-levels for both refugees and locals, as well as improving relations between refugees and hosts. The key to them being accepted has been that the host community has shared the benefits of these employment programmes.</p> <p><strong>4. Do you feel a Dollo Ado-style model could ever work in towns in the UK that host refugee communities, especially where there can be significant local hostility towards refugees? </strong></p> <p>It&rsquo;s crucial that host communities perceive that they benefit from the presence of refugees. Effective refugee policies need to ensure improved access to jobs and public services for both refugees and citizens living in refugee-hosting areas. This applies as much in the UK as it does in Ethiopia. We know from existing research that refugees can make a positive net economic contribution to host societies, whether in high or low-income countries. In the Ethiopian context, the presence of refugee camps has created thousands of jobs for citizens and new markets likely to be worth more than $50m in annual household expenditure. Research in Europe and the United States suggests that refugees&rsquo; tax contributions are greater than spending on public programmes for refugees, and that they contribute to GDP by starting new businesses and replacing aging populations. We also know that in both Europe and Africa, it is refugees&rsquo; economic contributions that matter most for shaping host community attitudes towards refugees. The difficulty is that political decision-making is not always shaped by evidence relating to economic contribution.</p> <p><strong>5. The UK government right now is going to great lengths to deter refugees from arriving here. Is this a government that cannot, for whatever reason, see refugees as potential contributors, and instead sees them only as a burden? </strong></p> <p>The British government has consciously created policies to deter the arrival of asylum-seekers. Its policies have deliberately nurtured a &ldquo;hostile environment&rdquo; and the current UK Borders and Nationality Bill criminalises the arrival of asylum seekers via irregular routes. The government views reducing asylum claims in the UK as a political necessity: in 2021 opinion polls reveal that immigration is the single most important issue, and it made (unrealistic) commitments that Brexit would mean sovereign borders. But underlying this is also a failure to recognise that around two-thirds of asylum seekers coming to the UK are refugees in need of international protection, and refugees are not an inevitable burden. Not only do we have humanitarian obligations towards refugees, but they can make significant contributions, and demographic trends and labour shortages make their contributions especially important. The UK government and British media need to recognise these contributions and change the narrative on refugees.</p> <p><strong>6. What would be needed to get greater buy-in for the idea of refugee self-reliance and long-term settlement in countries where intolerance is high? Is it merely that political conditions need to change, or do those who argue that the economy can&rsquo;t absorb a sizeable expansion in labour without entailing loss of jobs for locals have a valid point? </strong></p> <p>In low and middle-income countries that host most of the world&rsquo;s refugees, there is huge variation in policies. While some, such as Uganda and Colombia, offer refugees the right to work and freedom of movement, others like Tanzania and Bangladesh insist on the encampment of refugees. But some countries, such as Ethiopia and Kenya, have also embarked on gradual change. The key to opening up self-reliance opportunities and socio-economic rights for refugees in these countries is to ensure that the national governments and local authorities in refugee-hosting regions benefit. Development assistance, trade concessions, and private sector investment are needed to ensure receiving country politicians recognise a benefit. Jordan, for instance, changed its policies to allow Syrian refugees to work because of a combination of trade concessions from the European Union and finance from the World Bank. Rich countries have a strong incentive to support this type of change in host countries because it offers a means to reduce the need for onward migration.</p> <p><strong>7. There is a lag between arrival of refugees and the point at which they become net economic contributors. Several studies in Australia found that refugees only begin to make a positive economic contribution 10 or 12 years after settling. Does this reality complicate any advocacy for long-term integration, particularly among already deprived communities who are asked to host refugee populations? </strong></p> <p>Evidence from Australia and also the United States relating to the integration of, for example, Vietnamese refugees, does suggest that some of the contributions by refugees are lagged over time. The most significant contributions often come from the second-generation children of refugees. This observed lag has also been evident to some extent in Germany&rsquo;s integration of over one million Syrian refugees. It stems from the fact that when refugees move from poor countries to rich countries they often lack the education and skills to immediately contribute to high productivity economies. It takes time to provide the necessary educational and training opportunities. This can be addressed partly through clear public communication and upfront investment in education and vocational education opportunities.</p> <p><strong>8. You mention two countries, Tanzania and Denmark, where a generally tolerant historic attitude towards refugees has been replaced by an intolerant one. But for countries that have moved in the opposite direction, what role did self-reliance programmes play? </strong></p> <p>Several refugee-hosting countries have moved in a progressive direction. In 2016, Jordan changed its policy of not allowing Syrian refugees to access labour markets, allowing them to work in selected sectors. It did so partly because of an agreement called the Jordan Compact that offered the country EU trade concessions and World Bank concessionary finance in return for letting refugees work. In 2019, Ethiopia adopted new legislation that potentially gives refugees the right to work and freedom of movement. It did so because of international support for its national development strategy that offered support for Ethiopian industrialisation in exchange for offering jobs to refugees. In 2021, Colombia committed to allowing the temporary integration of all of its 1.7 million Venezuelan refugees in the country, partly because donor countries committed to support the country&rsquo;s development-based approaches for refugee-hosting cities. In all of these cases, international support for job-creation programmes that benefit both refugees and citizens have been crucial for unlocking progressive policy change.</p> <p><strong>9. What can we take from the examples of countries that have gradually opened up to refugees, particularly when arguments against integrating refugees are likely to intensify in the future as a result of depleted resources and greater global precarity? </strong></p> <p>Advocacy for refugee rights is becoming increasingly challenging around the world. Automation, offshoring, the rise of China and the economic legacy of Covid-19 are all adding to feelings of vulnerability among citizens in Europe and North America. Politicians often find it much easier to scapegoat migration than to explain the complexities of structural change in the global economy. Rights-based arguments based on international law are important, but they are increasingly falling on deaf ears. What is also needed is pragmatism, to create mechanisms to ensure that host societies around the world benefit - and perceive that they benefit - from the presence of refugees. This requires targeted policies that systematically improve access to employment and public services, such as education and health, for both refugees and nearby host community members.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Illustration by Steve Rawlings" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NEW_HUMANIST_WINTER_2v1aw2.jpg" height="1346" alt="NEW_HUMANIST_WINTER_2v1aw2" width="1648" /></p> <p>Anyone who has accidentally trodden on a cat&rsquo;s tail knows it has sensations. The purring that follows from a gentle stroke under its chin testifies to its more positive capacity for sensuous pleasure. Yet, until now, there has been no formal recognition that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing joy, pain and suffering. <br /><br />This finally looks likely to change. The Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill is making its way through the UK parliament. If passed, it will result in the establishment of the Animal Sentience Committee, charged with monitoring if and how government policy might have &ldquo;an adverse effect on the welfare of animals as sentient beings&rdquo;. Applying to vertebrates, it will be the first time British law has legally acknowledged that non-humans are conscious. Anything the government does that affects animals, in sectors from farming to construction to transport, will have to account for its impact on animal lives.<br /><br />It seems extraordinary that such a recognition has taken this long. The stubborn refusal to acknowledge reality, to protect the specialness of whoever &ldquo;we&rdquo; humans are, is deep-rooted. In his recent pro-vegan polemic <em>How to Love Animals</em>, Henry Mance points out that as recently as 1976, the journal <em>Hog Farm Management</em> was advising its readers, &ldquo;Forget the pig is an animal &ndash; treat him just like a machine in a factory.&rdquo; The more &ldquo;other&rdquo; animals are, the easier it is to disregard any responsibilities we might have for their welfare. <br /><br />What follows from this recognition of animal sentience is, however, far from obvious. Animal welfare minister Lord Goldsmith said that passing this law will be &ldquo;just the first step in our flagship Action Plan for Animal Welfare which will further transform the lives of animals in this country&rdquo;. Others include ending the export of live animals for slaughter, consulting on reforming labelling so that consumers can more easily buy food that aligns with their &ldquo;welfare values&rdquo;, and banning primates as pets.<br /><br />For many animal rights campaigners, it is assumed that animal rights are on the same trajectory as those for persecuted groups of humans over the last century. As the founder of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), Ingrid Newkirk, has said, &ldquo;In the same way that racist and sexist views allowed us to discriminate against minorities and women, speciesism allowed us to inscribe an inferior status on animals and to regard them not as individuals, but as objects and means to fulfil our desires.&rdquo; <br /><br />It will become impossible, these activists argue, to continue to kill and eat animals, or even to keep them for eggs and milk. We will be forced to recognise their right to live according to their true natures, experiencing the natural emotions of a wild animal, not the short and stressful existence of livestock. The reasoning seems to be that since we grant humans rights on the basis of their sentience, then animals, if they are indeed sentient, should also be granted the same or similar rights. <br /><br />But this apparently simply inference assumes that the basis of human rights is sentience, pure and simple. The reality, however, is far more complex.</p> <h2>Plato, Darwin and the arc of animal welfare</h2> <p>With the combined benefits of science and hindsight, many things that seem obvious to us now were far from evident for most of human history. Yet the accretion of learning can also have the opposite effect, blinding us to things so obvious that only a flawed theory could make us fail to notice them. The real nature and significance of animal sentience surely falls into this category. <br /><br />Traditional, unindustrialised societies are almost invariably animist. They see everything as being alive: mountains, rivers, plants, animals. The separation of human life into a category somehow distinct from other living matter requires some inventive conceptualisation. In the west, this has most obviously come in the form of the doctrine of the immaterial soul that breathes conscious life into otherwise oblivious matter. Adopted by Christianity, then filtered through the lens of a creation myth in which God gave humankind dominion over the other animals, it became a license to disregard their welfare and treat them as merely our tools.<br /><br />The lack of a soul doesn&rsquo;t rule out animals having sensations such as pain. It simply creates a hierarchy in creation within which the wellbeing of one kind of creature &ndash; humans who possess a soul &ndash; matters more than that of any other. So in order to disregard animal welfare there is no need to believe that, despite all appearances, animals have no feelings and awareness. All you need do is believe that somehow this kind of awareness doesn&rsquo;t matter. <br /><br />Variants of this trick recur in philosophy, theology and in the implicit beliefs that inform how people see the world. For example, although Descartes is notorious for regarding animals as mere automata, by this he simply meant that they acted automatically, on instinct. He did not believe that they didn&rsquo;t perceive or feel. This lack of reason was sufficient for Descartes to argue that we are free not only to kill and eat other animals, but to practise vivisection on them, as he himself did.<br /><br />Aristotle also promoted human exceptionalism, despite arguing that all living things had &ldquo;souls&rdquo;. This was not the immaterial self that Plato and later Christianity believed in, but an animating essence. Plants have a generative soul, which allowed growth and reproduction, while animals and humans also have a sensitive soul, which allows them to perceive and feel. Only humans, however, have a rational soul, giving them the capacity to reason and act on more than just instinct.<br /><br />The crucial moral distinction in western culture, therefore, has not been between sentient and non-sentient life, but between humans, who have reason and/or souls, and other animals, who do not. Although many people have believed that certain animals, such as fish, don&rsquo;t feel pain, few have doubted the reality of animal sentience altogether. What has varied is our view of how different it is from our own and how much it matters. <br /><br />That is probably one key reason why the arrival of the theory of evolution did not usher in a new era of concern for animal welfare. Darwin blew away the idea that human beings were created differently from other beasts. We all ultimately shared a common ancestor, and in the case of primates, a recent one too. Our sense of superiority, however, found a way to adapt and mutate to survive this intellectual revolution. Human beings simply became the most evolved of all creatures, at least in terms of our moral and rational capacities. Our shared sentience mattered less than our supposedly unique intelligence. <br /><br />Nonetheless, Darwin started us down a road that would inevitably lead us to some kind of reckoning and reassessment. The more we have found out about the animal kingdom the less tenable claims to any sharp divide between our capacities and theirs have become. The gap has been shrunk from one side by an increasing acceptance that supposedly unique human capacities have gradually been acknowledged as possessed by animals, and from the other by the realisation that so little of what we do is down to our so-called &ldquo;higher capacities&rdquo; anyway. We have learned that we are largely propelled by unconscious processes, cognitive short cuts and instincts. This is what made David Hume remarkably ahead of his time when he wrote of the reason of animals in the 18th century. Animals reasoned, he argued, not because they perform deductions, but because, like us, they generalise from past experience on the basis of inferences rooted more in instinct than in logic.</p> <h2>The unavoidable cruelty of nature</h2> <p>And so here we are in the third decade of the 21st century, finally having to face up to the fact that animals are indeed sentient and that neither our rational capacities nor any supposed immaterial soul puts us in an entirely different category to them. There can be no more turning a blind eye to the horrors of industrial animal farming, of creatures living in cages, of pet dogs doomed to ill health because they have been bred to look cute at the cost of their own wellbeing.</p> <p>But what now? Ironically it is the very ubiquity of sentience that makes the idea of extending human-like rights to all animals absurd. Nature is overflowing with consciousness but has a total disregard of the welfare of those who possess it. When the sentient eagle carries away the sentient rabbit in its talons, who can imagine the terror of the poor mammal? Salmon may feel pain but the brown bears who feast on them in their dozens don&rsquo;t make any efforts to reduce it.<br /><br />Traditionally, philosophers have been unimpressed by attempts to defend the killing of animals on the basis that animals kill each other. It looks like an embarrassing example of the is-ought fallacy: just because something is the case, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it ought to be. Animals do all sorts of cruel things and that cannot justify us doing the same. To put it even more clearly, just because something is natural does not make it right.<br /><br />But as Benjamin Franklin recorded in his autobiography, there is something about acknowledging head-on the cruelty of nature that makes any refusal to partake in it seem futile. At one point, Franklin had become a vegetarian, and when he set off one day on a fishing boat he still considered &ldquo;the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder, since none of them had or ever could do us any injury that might justify the slaughter&rdquo;.<br /><br />Franklin&rsquo;s resolve weakened when, out of the frying pan, the cod smelled &ldquo;admirably well&rdquo;. He found himself &ldquo;balanced some time between principle and inclination&rdquo;. What finally tipped the scales was seeing smaller fish taken out of the stomachs of cods when they were opened. &ldquo;Then thought I, &lsquo;If you eat one another, I don&rsquo;t see why we mayn&rsquo;t eat you&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br /><br />Franklin was candid about his baser motivations, and acknowledged that his line of thought hardly constituted a sound, rational argument. But his change of heart was not simply a victory of greed over principle. He was indeed using his intellect, not to follow a line of argument, but to attend more carefully to the fundamental truths that must inform our moral thinking.</p> <h2>The error of human exceptionalism</h2> <p>What Franklin perhaps realised is that to refrain from all forms of animal killing is not to show due respect to nature, but to misunderstand it. If you do truly understand nature, you see that death and killing are inextricable parts of it. To attempt to stand aside from it is, ironically, to repeat the mistake of human exceptionalism, by encouraging human beings to separate themselves from the harsh realities of a food system that cannot function with herbivores alone. People who really do have a feel for nature have greater genuine reverence for animal life than those whose alienation from it makes them repulsed by the idea of killing animals. <br /><br />Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s <em>The Old Man and The Sea</em> captures this brilliantly. The protagonist spends most of the book in pursuit of a marlin. Yet he empathises with the fish more than any vegetarian land-lubber ever could, and several lines combine almost religious reverence of it with a willingness to kill it. &ldquo;I love you and respect you very much,&rdquo; he says to the marlin. &ldquo;But I will kill you dead before this day ends.&rdquo; For the old man, reverence does not stop the killing, but it does change the way it is done.<br /><br />Hemingway may well have been a cruel bastard who once boasted of shooting a dog in such a way that it would take days to bleed to death. But still, his fictional character may be spot on, even if Hemingway himself was not. And if we look at how traditional hunters and pastoralists feel towards the animals they eat, it certainly seems that Hemingway was on to something. The preferred foods of the Maasai, one such group of pastoralists that inhabit a region encompassing northern Tanzania and southern Kenya, are meat, milk and blood. Their kinship with their herds is so close that their word for cattle, <em>inkishu</em>, is also used for the Maasai as a people. Most East African pastoralists also share names with their favoured ox.<br /><br />The Inuit also closely identify with the seal that they hunt, kill and eat. They believe both hunter and seal benefit from the hunting and that the &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; of the seals to be eaten is necessary for the animals to reproduce. The blood of an Inuit requires the blood of seals to make it thick and strong, unlike the watery blood of non-Inuit. &ldquo;Seal blood gives us our blood. Seal is life-giving,&rdquo; says one elder. &ldquo;Inuit blood is thick and dark like the seal we eat,&rdquo; says another.<br /><br />Time and again we find that the closer human beings have been to nature&rsquo;s natural cycles of life and death, the more they both respect other animals and are willing to eat them. This is not a flaw of &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; people but a profound understanding of the true meaning of kinship with other creatures that is lost in more industrialised cultures.</p> <h2>As inconsequential as sardines</h2> <p>There is one way in which traditional attitudes to nature do reflect an innocence that can no longer be maintained. The ways in which killing is ritualised and given spiritual significance speak to a seeming need among humans to give meaning to what would otherwise be a pointless cycle of life and death. But a hard-nosed, humanist view would be that it is simply all ultimately meaningless. <br /><br />The sheer quantity of death and killing in nature is awe-inspiring. Eagles bring a constant supply of small mammals and birds back to their nests to feed their young. Shoals of millions of sardines are fodder for larger predators like dolphins, who eat 25 to 50 pounds of fish every day. The degree of death and suffering in the natural world would be gratuitous if it were the product of design. If God exists, he must be some kind of sadist.<br /><br />If human beings are part of nature, then our own lives risk seeming as meaningless as those of wild prey. But the option of making ourselves an exception seems to be no longer tenable. So a tempting alternative is to give more significance to animal lives, to make them more important and so defend our own importance indirectly. But an honest look at nature will always tell us that although animals can feel joy or pain, at the end of the day their lives have no further meaning.<br /><br />So it seems we are on the fork of a dilemma. We can no longer see human beings as being completely separate from nature, and think of animal suffering as of no importance whatsoever. But if we put ourselves on the same level as the other animals, either we have to accept that our own deaths are as inconsequential in the grand scheme of things as those of krill and sardines, or we have to make animal death so meaningful that we strive to avoid it, in a world in which such efforts are as futile as trying to stop the rains.<br /><br />Perhaps there is another way of reconciling the realities of animal sentience and the inexorable cycles of killing and eating. We have to start by recognising that what makes human life worth preserving is not the mere fact that it is sentient. Human rationality and self-consciousness may not be entirely distinct from that of other animals, but it is far more developed. Even the most intelligent of other animals only ever lives instinctively. No dolphin has ever gone off and started an alternative dolphin community based on novel political values, and whales do not choose to be childless because they have other desires that matter more to them. Human culture is uniquely diverse and distant from our species&rsquo; rawest evolutionary imperatives of survival and reproduction.<br /><br />That may or may not make us better. But it does make us different. Most obviously, it makes full-blown morality possible: we can choose our actions on the basis of what we judge to be right or wrong, not merely on what instinct compels us to think and do. So we could refrain, for example, from killing other animals, something my cat could never do. But the fact that we can do this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we should. The argument that we should avoid inflicting unnecessary suffering is strong, but given the necessity of death and killing in nature, we need more reasons to avoid ending life. <br /><br />Our human difference gives us reasons not to kill each other that go beyond simplistic injunctions to never kill or never shorten life at all. Unlike other animals, we do not live just in the present. Our memories, plans and projects matter to us in ways that are inconceivable for any other creature. When you kill any animal, you frustrate its natural desire to live. But when you kill a human being, you close off the possibility of a future of near infinite variability, which is not just one of doing what our kind naturally does. That is what opens up the possibility of human life having real meaning. We can create narratives for our lives, reflect on what we value and cherish it. <br /><br />I have no doubt that animal lives can be worth living. I believe my cat has a good life and that to end it for no reason at all would be pointless. But my cat is also a heartless killer who will play with prey and leave it for dead. When he dies, another light will go out in the universe but no aspiration will have gone unfulfilled, other than a simple desire to stay alive. His death will be a cause for sadness but only because the sadness of death is the necessary companion of the joy of being alive. Life is and can only be full of the wonder of being alive, the pain of suffering and the sadness of good things passing.<br /><br />To recognise properly the reality of animal sentience requires us to accept that conscious life is the light that flickers all too briefly in an otherwise dark universe. It is wonderful but it never lasts, and if we measured its value by its length the whole of nature would seem worthless.</p> <h2>Ending the horror of mass industrial farming</h2> <p>To truly value sentience requires just two things. The first is never to cause more suffering to anything than is necessary. What should appal us is not that we eat the other animals but that we often keep them in such dreadful conditions before putting them out of their misery. The second is to treat them with the same reverence that traditional hunters, pastoralists, farmers and fishers have. We need to respect animals for the fleeting eruptions of consciousness that they are, not as though they had human-like life projects that we have cruelly cut short.<br /><br />At present, the vast majority of humankind errs in opposite directions. Most fail to respect animal sentience at all, treating livestock like meat machines. A growing minority, however, think of animals as though they were cuddly versions of ourselves &ndash; creatures who deserve a long life and for whom death at anything other than an old age is a tragedy rather than a common fact of life. They are in denial, like the vegan cat-lover who refuses their companion animal meat. To love a cat and yet not accept the way it naturally lives is not to truly love it at all, but simply to adore a sentimentalised, sanitised version of it.<br /><br />Our choices about animal welfare reflect these two extremes. If humankind became vegan, all we would be doing is separating ourselves from the harsh realities of animal life. Death and suffering would still go on; we would merely have washed our hands of it. If we carry on as we are, we are making nature even crueller than it already is. The eagle&rsquo;s prey has a horrible death, but such torture is fleeting compared to that of too many farm animals.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, we keep only as much livestock as we humanely can and treat it well, then we improve upon nature. This needs to be no more than the planet can sustain, but while it requires much less animal husbandry than we have under mass industrial farming, it is significantly more than zero. In such a future, the animals under our stewardship would have easier lives than those of their wild cousins, with medicines when they are sick and a compassionate painless death when their time comes. The sentience we would then honour would be of an authentic kind: the in-the-present wonder of any conscious animal, whose life is incredible, but which never has any greater meaning and cannot be made more meaningful simply by virtue of being made longer.</p> <p><em>This piece is from New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Candidates include the disruption of the supply chain, poverty set to worsen as the cost of living rises, astronomical waiting lists for hospital treatment, and increasing numbers of children who are falling behind in, or even falling out of, education. The predictable results of Brexit are starting to play out, with damage to fishing, farming and other industries, the threat of the return of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and the possible breakup of the United Kingdom. And there are the consequences of the mismanagement of the pandemic and uncertainty about its future evolution. <br /><br />But the most serious of all these serious problems is one that lies at the root of many of the others: it is a crisis in parliamentary democracy. At the heart of this crisis is an individual who happens to be the prime minister. Asserting that Boris Johnson is a liar is now regarded as a statement of the boringly obvious, like saying he has untidy hair. The Independent identified eight major lies in his October party conference speech. Presented with the truth &ndash; as he was in an interview with Andrew Marr, who challenged his claims over wage increases &ndash; he simply reiterates his lies with a trademark smirk.<br /><br />There is only one place where it is unsafe to say this &ndash; the place where lying matters most, namely, the Houses of Parliament. When, last summer, Labour MP Dawn Butler highlighted the danger presented by Johnson&rsquo;s mendacity, especially in a pandemic, she was asked to leave the House. In an article subsequently written with the ex-Speaker of the Commons John Bercow, she argued that the rule barring MPs from calling each other liars was &ldquo;the product of a bygone age&rdquo;.<br /><br />The frightening fact is that that age is not so bygone. As recently as 2018, Esther McVey, then Work and Pensions Secretary, made an incorrect statement about Universal Credit. This was challenged by the National Audit Office. She was obliged to return to parliament to correct her statement and apologise for misleading the house. By contrast, Johnson&rsquo;s eye-popping lie that there would be no paperwork associated with a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK has passed without official rebuke, though the border and the associated paperwork have proven to be hugely disruptive.</p> <h2>The rot in the United Kingdom's body politic</h2> <p>In August, a petition to introduce legislation to make lying in parliament a criminal offence secured more than a 100,000 signatures. Having passed this threshold, the petition, backed by campaigner and lawyer Peter Stefanovic, is now being considered for debate in the Commons. Such a debate may prove unlikely, given the government&rsquo;s response that &ldquo;conduct in the Chamber is a matter for the Speaker&rdquo;. But while debating the issue would surely cause embarrassment to the prime minister and his government, avoiding it altogether should also be a point of shame. <br /><br />The body politic is rotting. The prime minister is of course not a solitary actor: he is supported by colleagues whose incompetence may be welcome as it makes his own less visible, as well as by the adoring rank-and-file members of his party. But so long as Johnson can lie with impunity, and continue doing so even when his lies have been called out &ndash; and so long as it is Johnson himself who is responsible for the enforcement of the ministerial code that regulates the behaviour of politicians &ndash; the rot will continue to spread from the top down. <br /><br />Behind this threat is an assault on the very idea of truth. Among the most iniquitous enemies of truth are those academics who quote Nietzsche&rsquo;s assertion that &ldquo;there are no facts, only interpretations&rdquo;. Such relativism is, of course, set aside when their interests are at stake and they check their pay slips. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the standing of the UK as a moral force in a world facing an uncertain future is diminishing. What will COP26 delegates think as they are addressed by a man described as &ldquo;the most accomplished liar in public life&rdquo; by a leading figure in his own party &ndash; Rory Stewart, a junior minister in the Foreign Office when Johnson was foreign secretary? Of great concern is that a distrustful electorate with a dangerous indifference that says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who to believe; they are all the same&rdquo; may ease the passage from democracy to kleptocracy and tyranny. <br /><br />We have yet to see whether the petition to criminalise lying in the Commons will be granted its debate. If such legislation were to pass, it would leave Johnson and others like him with little to say.</p> <p><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

As we know all too well, anti-vaccine sentiment driven by conspiracy theories and partisan cynicism has dampened what is otherwise an unmistakable victory for science.

By the time the final volume had been published in English in 2015, the quartet had become an international bestseller, sparking what we now know as &ldquo;Ferrante Fever&rdquo;. However, it was her first three novels, Ferrante has suggested, that allowed her the &ldquo;creative space&rdquo; to write the quartet. She sees them as &ldquo;part of a chain&rdquo; that deal with similar themes and concerns.</p> <p>This should give Ferrante fans, as well as those discovering her work, more reason to watch <em>The Lost Daughter,</em> a film version of the last of those formative three novels, due for release in January. Adapted and directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, the film features a star-studded female cast, including Jessie Buckley, Olivia Colman and Dakota Johnson. Ferrante has taken a hands-off approach to the adaptation, in keeping with the fact that she has famously kept her true identity hidden. In a letter to her publisher in 2016, affirming this stance, she wrote: &ldquo;I believe that books, once they are written, have no need of their authors. If they have something to say, they will sooner or later find readers; if not, they won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p> <p>However, she did make one crucial intervention. When Gyllenhaal, a seasoned actor, wrote to Ferrante asking for permission to adapt <em>The Lost Daughter</em>, the author agreed, but on one intriguing condition: Gyllenhaal had to direct it herself or the contract was &ldquo;null and void&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Mothers, daughters and dolls</h2> <p>Mothers and daughters are a recurrent theme in Ferrante&rsquo;s work and none more so than <em>The Lost Daughter</em> (originally published in 2006 as <em>La figlia oscura</em>), a book about a woman who abandons her children. In Gyllenhaal&rsquo;s compelling adaptation, the protagonist, Leda Caruso (Colman), a professor of literature and a specialist in Italian translation, is on holiday alone on a Greek island. Leda is divorced; her grown-up daughters live with their father. On the beach she encounters a large, loud and uncouth American family. Leda becomes fascinated with one family member, Nina (Johnson), a beautiful young woman, and her daughter Elena (Athena Martin).</p> <p>The book and film follow similar trajectories. Leda envies Nina&rsquo;s close relationship with her daughter and her apparent maternal serenity. The child reflects her mother&rsquo;s love in her attachment to her doll, named Nani, &ldquo;from whom the child was never parted and to whom Nina paid attention as if she were alive, a second daughter&rdquo;. But then Elena goes missing on the beach and there is uproar. Leda recalls her own panic when one of her own daughters was lost, but reassures Nina, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s wearing your hat&hellip; She&rsquo;ll be found, we&rsquo;ll see her easily.&rdquo; Leda is applauded when she finds the girl. However, as we soon discover, she has stolen Elena&rsquo;s abandoned doll: a senseless, some would say cruel, act that even Leda doesn&rsquo;t truly comprehend. As she comments at the beginning of the novel: &ldquo;The hardest things to talk about are the ones we ourselves can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p> <p>Of the book, Gyllenhaal commented at the New Yorker Festival in 2018: &ldquo;I have never heard these things articulated before. There was one point where I was like, this woman is so fucked up, and then I was like, I totally relate to her.&rdquo; In an interview with the <em>New York Times</em> in 2014, Ferrante refers to it as &ldquo;the most daring, the most risk-taking&rdquo; of all her early novels, with themes that troubled her the most, claiming: &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t gone through that, with great anxiety, I wouldn&rsquo;t have written <em>My Brilliant Friend</em> [the first volume of her Neapolitan quartet].&rdquo; A year later, she told the Flemish paper <em>De Standaard</em>: &ldquo;It cost me a lot to write&hellip; [and] left me feeling the way you do when you swim until you&rsquo;re exhausted and then you realise you&rsquo;ve gone too far from the shore.&rdquo;</p> <p>It&rsquo;s easy to see Ferrante&rsquo;s first two novels as part of a chain leading to the third. In her debut, <em>L&rsquo;amore molesto</em> (1992), translated into English as <em>Troubling Love</em> in 2006, Delia is obsessed with her mother Amalia&rsquo;s beauty. After learning that she has drowned, Delia travels home to Naples for the funeral and attempts to piece together the details surrounding her mysterious death. In doing so she is forced to confront her own troubling childhood memories. In <em>I giorni dell&rsquo;abbandono</em> (2002), translated as <em>Days of Abandonment </em>in 2005 and made into a film the same year by Roberto Faenza, Olga has a breakdown after her husband leaves her for a younger woman. She neglects her children, but her young daughter&rsquo;s presence helps bring her back from the brink.</p> <p><em>The Lost Daughter</em> also points to the quartet to come. For Leda, it is a lost doll that precipitates her emotional crisis. A similar motif occurs in <em>My Brilliant Friend</em> &ndash; at the start of the novel, childhood friends Lila and Len&ugrave; throw each other&rsquo;s dolls into the cellar of an apartment owned by Don Achille Carracci, &ldquo;the ogre of fairy tales&rdquo;. Ferrante went on to write a children&rsquo;s novel, <em>La spiaggia di notte</em> (<em>The Beach at Night</em>), narrated by the doll from <em>The Lost Daughter.</em></p> <h2>Ferrante's 'fragmenting' characters</h2> <p>Much of the drama in the book and film comes from the question of whether Leda will keep the doll or give it back. The child, Elena, is distraught by the loss, but instead of returning the doll, Leda buys it new clothes from the local toy shop. Her transgression provokes recollections of her own childhood doll, Mina, that she had given to her eldest daughter. This leads to a deluge of memories where we learn Leda abandoned her children so she could pursue academic success and a passionate love affair with the charismatic Professor Hardy (Peter Sarsgaard). In the novel, Leda recalls all her bad mothering moments &ndash; when she had shouted at her children, slammed a door shut on one of them, or thrown the doll out of the window. Gyllenhaal is kinder and shows young Leda (Buckley) in a series of flashbacks as a loving mother, genuinely torn between her work and her children.</p> <p>In a 2007 interview with the Italian press, Ferrante claims that Leda &ldquo;sought an emancipation and confrontation on equal terms with the male world&rdquo;. She had wanted both children and a career. Gyllenhaal&rsquo;s adaptation explores this decision with understanding and grace. Ferrante&rsquo;s novel is darker &ndash; accenting a mean, selfish streak in Leda followed by a crushing guilt that haunts her. One can convey a character&rsquo;s emotional scars, their hidden thoughts, what Ferrante has called their &ldquo;fragmentation&rdquo;, more easily in a novel than a film. Perhaps inevitably, then, both Gyllenhaal&rsquo;s <em>The Lost Daughter</em> and Faenza&rsquo;s <em>Days of Abandonment</em> soften the darkness at the heart of the novels, along with the obsessive nature and intensity of the female protagonists, making the characters more sympathetic for a film audience.</p> <p>The apparent ease with which Gyllenhaal has adapted the novel for a mainstream audience is an indication of the authenticity of Ferrante&rsquo;s text &ndash; something she always strives for. One of the reasons her fiction translates so well onto screen is because she shows, rather than tells, difficult emotions. Part of the pleasure of <em>The Lost Daughter</em>, in both forms, is the honesty with which the female protagonist is drawn and, in the film, the beauty with which Colman conveys it: a nuanced portrait of a middle-aged woman &ndash; flawed, prickly, sympathetic. As Ferrante observed in a <em>Vanity Fair</em> interview in 2015: &ldquo;Honest writing forces itself to find words for those parts of our experience that are hidden and silent.&rdquo; It is this ability to express the complexity of women&rsquo;s feelings &ndash; as children, mothers and friends &ndash; how they function in a patriarchal society and cope with obstacles including isolation and abandonment, that gives Ferrante&rsquo;s work its enduring appeal. Gyllenhaal&rsquo;s film is a bold, textured exploration of motherhood with a refreshing lack of sentimentality that will undoubtedly win Ferrante new fans.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021.

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook&#8217;s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>
