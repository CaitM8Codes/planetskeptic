            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">This is a bizarre (but very short) video talking about a letter written by Eric Hovind, about his father, Kent Hovind. It&#8217;s a bit inside baseball &#8212; Kent Hovind divorced his wife, Jo Hovind, the woman who got dragged into prison as a consequence of her participation in his scam to defraud the government of taxes. He then married a woman named Mary Tocco, who later <a href="http://kehvrlb.com/mary-tocco-on-leaving-kent-hovind">left him</a> because she suspected he was up to no good again. Hovind told everyone that his divorce and remarriage was fully endorsed by his family and all the good Christians he knew, but apparently not. This letter lists all the people who told him this was a bad idea.</p>
<div class="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qNO3HKGsQ8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Kent Hovind lied, no surprises there.</p>
<p><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/hovindsins-500x280.png" alt="" width="500" height="280" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65002" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/hovindsins-500x280.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/hovindsins-150x84.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/hovindsins-300x168.png 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/hovindsins-768x430.png 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/hovindsins.png 1497w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>The video was posted by <a href="http://kehvrlb.com/kent-hovind-cindi-lincoln-get-married">his current &#8220;wife&#8221;</a>, Cindi Lincoln (he seems not to have divorced Tocco before the wedding), who is also the woman he was convicted of abusing, and at this point I am overwhelmed by the soap opera and give up. Lincoln tries to explain.</p>
<blockquote><p>Eric&#8217;s email lists 17 professional counselors, attorneys, Board Members, family members and friends who advised Kent NOT to marry Mary, but Kent refuses to heed.  Kent also lied to the public about &#8220;everyone telling him to marry Mary, and that only 1 or 2 people told him not to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like with me, Kent and I had several friends, DAL leaders, family, legal, and counselors give advise for Kent to pay me what he signed for, and to put his wife over Steve, and to NOT torment me with Steve, Ernie, and Brady&#8217;s abuse.  Kent refused to heed their advise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a PSA: don&#8217;t ever get romantically involved with Kent Hovind. He&#8217;s a psychopath, and it will always end badly.</p>
<p>Matt Powell, I hope you&#8217;ve got everything in writing.</p>

<p class="lead">I hope you&#8217;re all a lot less depressed than I am. This is not a good time of year for me, but maybe you&#8217;re still doing fine. Good! Celebrate!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my Christmas misery.</p>
<p>My father died quietly, in his sleep, on Christmas 28 years ago. You&#8217;d think it would stop hurting after 28 years, and no, it doesn&#8217;t, and it&#8217;s what I think of when I hear the word &#8220;Christmas&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is not to say that there aren&#8217;t good associations, too &#8212; I had many years with kids getting deliriously happy at Christmas. Unfortunately, we&#8217;re not going to see any of them this year. We&#8217;ll all hunkering down in our houses and refusing to see anyone, or to have parties, or to even go outside. The family aspect, the best part of the season, is gone.</p>
<p>Then, I got my Christmas present from my wife. Christmas presents are good, right? Nope, not this one. She signed me up for this thing called <a href="https://www.wellnessverge.com/zoe-personalized-nutrition-review">Zoe Personal Nutrition</a>, which is all about microbiome analysis and monitoring the effects of your diet on your physiology. The science is appealing. I like contributing to a scientific project as a subject. The reality is a little less thrilling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I stabbed myself with this continuous glucose monitor that I&#8217;ll be wearing for two weeks. That&#8217;s not so bad.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve is poop sampling day. I got some gloves and a disposable sheet to spread across the toilet and a scoop and a sealable test tube and a mailer. Oh boy.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I get to stick myself to take blood samples, and all I get to eat is some special muffins for breakfast and lunch. That&#8217;s my Christmas feast: prepackaged frozen muffins.</p>
<p>After that, I&#8217;ll be scanning and weighing every single thing I eat for the next six months, and Mary is going to be monitoring my diet closely. Doesn&#8217;t that sound fun? I tried to tell her she could have saved a lot of money and labor if we just got a pizza for Christmas dinner, but apparently I don&#8217;t eat pizzas anymore.</p>
<p>The end result, though, will be Science, I guess. A research team will know all about my microbiome composition, and how my body responds to various factors in my diet, and they&#8217;ll tell me all about it, and get a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8265154/pdf/nihms-1712232.pdf">publication</a> or two out of it. I have no idea what I&#8217;ll do with the information &#8212; giving me a catalog of what species reside in my colon is about as useful as telling me that I&#8217;m a Pisces. </p>
<p>Oh, well. Christmas sucks anyway. I&#8217;ll probably spend the day hanging out in the lab alone with my spiders.</p>

<blockquote><p>Los Angeles police have fatally shot a 14-year-old girl who was in the dressing room of a clothing store when officers fired at an assault suspect and a bullet went through the wall, hitting the girl, authorities have said.</p>
<p>Officers also fatally shot the suspect on Thursday morning at a Burlington store in the North Hollywood area of the San Fernando valley, police said.</p>
<p>Witnesses told KCBS-TV that a man began acting erratically, threatening to throw items from the upper floor, and attacked a woman with a bicycle lock shortly before noon as the store was crowded with holiday shoppers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since when is opening fire a reasonable response to a guy with a bike lock? So here&#8217;s a man going nuts in a crowded store, and the chickenshit police decide that the best way to handle it is a volley of gunfire, killing two people.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a Christmas short story for you: &#8220;Police found her dead in a changing room with her mother.&#8221; Jesus christ. 14. Christmas shopping with her mom. Blown away by a cop doing what, apparently, we expect cops to do.</p>
<p>There will be no reform of the police because we can&#8217;t have happy endings anymore.</p>
<p>Damn. I can&#8217;t even think of that mom without tears starting to well up.</p>

<p class="lead">I&#8217;m feeling heroic. For the first time in months, I walked all the way to my lab and back (a distance of less than 100 meters) on my own two feet. The secret was to wear a pair of oversized, felt-lined boots that did not tickle my Achilles tendon at all, although they made a clumsy gallumphing thumping racket as I shambled across the street. I think I just need to do this every day for a while to get back in shape for the 100 meter slog when classes commence again on 18 January. And then the cross-country hiking when field season starts again, maybe in May.</p>
<p>I had to go to the lab to feed my children, who are all doing quite well, and quite voraciously. I posted a photo of one of the husky young males on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/spider-boy-shall-60258275">Patreon</a>, but for the arachnophobic among you, you shall have to settle for a twig in the snow. It is quite a nice twig, sort of seasonally festive and all that, but sadly lacking spiders. I thought about sneaking in a subtle little Dictynid nestled in the needles, but even they are getting scarce here in Icebox World.</p>

Looking wan and tense, Githa talked about her growth as a writer, from her Commonwealth Award-winning debut, <em>The Thousand Faces of Night</em>, to her latest novel, <em>I Have Become the Tide</em>, which deals with themes of justice and caste. Addressing an invisible audience from her computer screen, Githa&rsquo;s tone grew urgent as she spoke of her literary values and her disagreement with the idea of writers as silver-tongued illusionists.<br /><br />This is no time &ldquo;to wax lyrical&rdquo;, she said, but &ldquo;to use words as what they are, weapons&rdquo;: the challenge is to discover solidarity, imagine multiplicity and connectedness. This is necessary, she added, if we are to resist the ascent of a &ldquo;homogeneous story&rdquo; which &ldquo;invariably leads to the exclusion of people [&hellip;] to censorship [&hellip;] to what the poet Seamus Heaney called &lsquo;the government of the tongue&rsquo;, and today that&rsquo;s where we are in our country&rdquo;. <br />Githa&rsquo;s words were all the more striking given her situation. It was four days since officials from the government&rsquo;s financial investigation agency, the Enforcement Directorate, had confined her and her partner, Prabir Purkayastha, to their house, blocking them from contact with the outside world, including lawyers. Her appearance at the literature festival, by special leave, was the first glimpse of her since the enforced disappearance. Halfway through the interview, she noted that it was exactly 100 hours since the Enforcement Directorate had taken over her life. They would remain for another 14 hours. <br /><br />While Githa and Prabir were effectively held hostage in their home, Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government had been planting stories against them. That very morning, the <em>Indian Express</em>, a leading national daily, had carried a report about some 30 crore rupees (&pound;3 million) in foreign &ldquo;remittances&rdquo; received by Prabir&rsquo;s media company, PPK NewsClick, payments the Enforcement Directorate was investigating. The report mentioned that the <em>Express</em> had not heard back from emails and texts sent to Prabir and <em>NewsClick</em>&rsquo;s editor, Pranjal Pandey. <br /><br />Had the newspaper tried asking around, it would have discovered that no one could reach Prabir. When the raids began on the morning of 9 February, from the <em>NewsClick</em> office to the homes of seven of its staff members &ndash; including Prabir and Pranjal &ndash; their access to phones and other electronic devices was suspended. As Githa addressed the Shoolini Literature Festival, the sleuthing carried on around her. The <em>Express </em>was not alone with its one-sided report. On 9 February, another national daily, the <em>Hindustan Times</em>, had published the government&rsquo;s claim that <em>NewsClick</em> was being probed for money laundering.</p> <h2>Tax raids, sedition and anti-terror laws</h2> <p>Raids like that on <em>NewsClick</em> have become routine in India: between 2011 and 2020, over 1,700 raids were carried out in connection with 1,569 investigations of tax evasion and money laundering. Only nine cases in this period ended with a conviction in court. The real punishment arrives with the long wait for a trial: bank accounts are frozen and questioning continues, as do raids and the harassment of employees. &ldquo;The process becomes the punishment,&rdquo; as Prabir wryly sums it up. <br /><br />In July this year, after a devastating second wave of Covid exposed the government&rsquo;s unpreparedness for a health crisis, both the television company Bharat Samachar and the Dainik Bhaskar Group, owner of one of the highest-circulating newspapers in Hindi, were raided &ndash; the latter at over 30 locations in five states. The two media houses had reported on the discrepancy between the government&rsquo;s low count of Covid fatalities and the real numbers logged by graveyards and cremation grounds. <br /><br />Tax raids have also been used against global organisations. In September 2020, Amnesty International was forced to halt operations in India after a succession of raids by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate. Amnesty had been sharply critical of human rights abuses in the wake of the Modi government&rsquo;s 2019 decision to rescind the constitutional recognition of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and again of the government&rsquo;s use of repressive new laws, whether in Kashmir or elsewhere in the country.<br /><br />If the Bureau and the Directorate don&rsquo;t sound Orwellian enough, there is also the National Investigation Agency, which handles cases of sedition and terrorism. Anti-terror laws and charges of sedition are a variation on the tax raid, freely used to silence critics. Sedition cases have shown a 28 per cent increase each year since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. At the start of its second term in 2019, the government also sharpened an already harsh law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The amended law permits the government to designate an individual as a terrorist before proving the charge in court. <br /><br />Bail is virtually impossible to obtain under the UAPA, and the government has the right to hold an accused person in custody for up to 180 days without presenting a charge sheet against them. The Bureau and the Agency handle cases under this law; both sedition and UAPA charges have been levelled at journalists on a regular basis. <br /><br />In October 2020, while covering the story of a caste atrocity &ndash; the gang rape and torture of a young Dalit woman that had led to her death &ndash; the journalist Siddique Kappan was arrested and charged with being a terrorist. More than a year later, he remains in prison awaiting trial. Once again, the rate of conviction is low, at less than 2 per cent of the 7,840 arrests made between 2015 and 2019. The rate of pendency (cases waiting to reach trial) stands at 83 per cent &ndash; the harrassment being the point.</p> <h2>Modi&rsquo;s &ldquo;unofficial Emergency&rdquo;</h2> <p>Opposition leaders and the commentariat often compare what is unfolding today to Indira Gandhi&rsquo;s suspension of democracy in 1975, terming it Modi&rsquo;s &ldquo;unofficial Emergency&rdquo;. Gandhi&rsquo;s 21-month-long dictatorship had entailed the suspension of fundamental rights, imprisonment of opposition leaders and pervasive press censorship. Modi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Emergency&rdquo; is more insidious. Rather than a straightforward authoritarian regime with a single author, it is built upon interlocking circles of collusion, an elite consensus that amplifies the government&rsquo;s message and supports its disruptive behaviour. India&rsquo;s mass media is no simple victim but part of this convergence of interests, and it is complicit in the gutting of democratic citizenship.<br /><br />At first glance, India&rsquo;s media landscape in print and broadcasting looks diverse: in 2018, there were over 118,239 publications, along with more than 380 news and current affairs channels on television. This appearance is deceptive: just a few media houses dominate the market. Their business models tend to rely on earnings from advertising, which makes editorial and journalistic freedom vulnerable to &ldquo;soft pressure&rdquo; from both government and corporations. <br /><br />Modi has set a record by becoming the first Indian prime minister to complete a full term in office without calling a single press conference. He did, however, spend twice as much on advertising in his first five years as the previous government did in ten. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the Economist Intelligence Unit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Democracy Index&rdquo; charts a steep decline in India&rsquo;s position. In 2014, it was ranked at 27 out of 167 countries; by 2020, it stood at 53, and was reclassified as a &ldquo;flawed democracy&rdquo;. International surveys echo this finding. This year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Democracy Report&rdquo;, published by the V-Dem Institute in Sweden, describes India&rsquo;s lapse from an &ldquo;electoral democracy&rdquo; in 2010 to an &ldquo;electoral autocracy&rdquo; in 2020. The grim proof of these assessments is the derisive manner in which they are reported on &ndash; or, frequently enough, not reported &ndash; in India&rsquo;s newsrooms.<br /><br />Palagummi Sainath, founder of the People&rsquo;s Archive of Rural India, points out that the Indian media systematically overlooks 70 per cent of the country&rsquo;s population. Coverage of rural issues makes up 0.67 per cent of front-page news in the national dailies, while crime and entertainment dominate the middle pages. Can it even be called &ldquo;mainstream media&rdquo;, he asks, if it studiously ignores the mainstream? And can its coverage of farmers&rsquo; protests be fair when the billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who gains from new laws that bring agriculture under corporate control, also happens to be India&rsquo;s biggest media owner?<br /><br />Despite lack of resources, small and independent digital platforms increasingly do the heavy lifting in terms of both news coverage and breaking stories. <em>NewsClick</em>, set up in a shabby one-room studio 12 years ago, saw viewership rise dramatically with its coverage of the farmers&rsquo; protest movement that began in 2020. Erupting with renewed vigour in early February this year, the farmers had the Modi government on the back foot when the Enforcement Directorate came calling on <em>NewsClick</em>.</p> <h2>Inequality in India&rsquo;s media houses</h2> <p>Inequality is entrenched in India&rsquo;s media houses. Oxfam India and the digital platform <em>Newslaundry </em>helped to expose this reality with their 2019 study &ldquo;Who Tells Our Stories Matters&rdquo;, which examined the representation of different groups in the media, including the indigenous Adivasis or Scheduled Tribes, and the Dalit communities (Scheduled Castes). Dalits make up 16.6 per cent of the national population, and continue to face widespread discrimination and violence, despite untouchability being outlawed. The study examined a selection of print, television and digital platforms in English and Hindi, finding that the Scheduled Tribes, who make up 8.6 per cent of the national population, were virtually absent from newsrooms. In prominent dailies such as the <em>Times of India</em> and the <em>Economic Times</em>, all the writers on caste issues turned out to be members of the upper castes.<br /><br />India&rsquo;s media is not an outlier here. Social exclusion is rampant in corporate boardrooms, the judiciary, bureaucracy, research and teaching positions in universities, and notably in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) &ndash; the mothership of Hindu nationalist ideology. A secretive and profoundly undemocratic organisation that reaches into every sphere of public life, the RSS has been led through the 96 years of its existence by six unelected men in succession, five of them from India&rsquo;s highest caste, the Brahmins (the remaining one was a Kshatriya, the second-highest caste). <br /><br />Away from traditional media institutions, however, excluded social groups have a vibrant presence in the digital and social media space. Among their demands is an all-India caste census (the last one was published in 1931). A new caste census, the journalist and public intellectual Dilip Mandal points out, would disclose each caste group&rsquo;s share in the national population, and in wealth, income, savings, credit, higher education and employment. This is precisely the kind of information suppressed by the elite consensus, whether between government and capital or that of upper-caste cohesion, for it would expose Hindutva to some painful truths. The last thing they want is for caste to be acknowledged as a dividing line within the Hindu social order, between entitlement and deprivation.<br /><br />Over the past three years, the prison population of underprivileged Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims has been joined by some of the country&rsquo;s most distinguished anti-caste scholars, lawyers, journalists and rights activists, all of them charged with terrorism under the UAPA. Self-assertion, whether by subordinate caste groups seeking their rightful share of resources, or by the anti-caste movement &ndash; which identifies Hinduism as the basis of caste &ndash; is a grave threat to the RSS&rsquo;s projection of a homogeneous and conservative Hindu nationhood.</p> <h2>The force of Hindutva</h2> <p>Promoting Islamophobia offers an escape route from the subject of caste and has proved useful for Modi in broadening Hindutva&rsquo;s base. &ldquo;Modi hai tau mumkin hai&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Modi makes it possible&rdquo; &ndash; was the insinuating slogan that returned the BJP government for a second term in 2019. The party&rsquo;s increased vote share and parliamentary majority were swiftly parlayed into a mandate to reshape the constitution. On 3 August that year, the amended UAPA overturned the presumption of innocence as a legal principle in terror-related cases. Two days later, the central government revoked Article 370 &ndash; which had granted the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir special recognition &ndash; and also trifurcated the state. Led by a raucous media, public opinion across the country cheered the dissolution of Kashmir&rsquo;s constitutional status. <br /><br />By the end of 2019, the central government had passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which obstructs Muslim immigrants from obtaining Indian citizenship. Amit Shah, the minister of home affairs, promised to launch a National Register of Citizens next. The poorly documented among India&rsquo;s Muslims, citizens included, saw themselves at imminent risk of being derecognised and interned. <br /><br />To supporters of Hindutva in the mass media, these were powerful moves. Primetime shows fanned the hatred, accusing Muslims of bizarre, wholly imaginary crimes, from waging &ldquo;love jihad&rdquo; (marrying Hindu women) to &ldquo;UPSC jihad&rdquo; (seeking jobs in the civil services), and even &ldquo;corona jihad&rdquo; (deliberately infecting Hindus). With this free pass for Islamophobia came a fresh contempt for facts and reasoning. This disdain was also extended to defenders of secular values: cued by BJP leaders, television studios denounced human rights activists as the &ldquo;bits-and-pieces gang&rdquo; of &ldquo;anti-national&rdquo; subversives, and as &ldquo;urban Naxals&rdquo; &ndash; secret agents fomenting a communist insurrection. When a group of writers returned their state awards in protest at the government&rsquo;s inaction against violence by lynch mobs attacking Dalits, Muslims and other minorities, they too were deemed &ldquo;anti-national&rdquo;. In these ways, the mass media has helped transform Modi&rsquo;s electoral victory into an epistemic coup. <br /><br />Githa&rsquo;s latest novel, <em>I Have Become the Tide</em>, shows an India where old forms of bigotry continue to defeat struggles for public reason, inclusion and dignity. However, the novel ends by marking a fresh start, as a great swell of people advances to confront a decaying culture. The ending is not a poetic consolation. Githa also put together a companion volume of non-fiction, <em>Battling for India</em>, that collates accounts of political resistance and ground-level organisation &ndash; by women, Dalits, Adivasis, writers, artists, religious, ethnic and sexual minorities &ndash; rallying against Hindutva and the neoliberal oligarchy. <br /><br />It may not be Birnam Wood and the troops advancing on Macbeth, not yet, but this force has the courage of its convictions. India&rsquo;s mass media, dwindling and demoralised, ignores this swell of resistance at its peril.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

There, my father had an annual engagement that, to be quite frank, embarrassed the hell out of us both. In the boot of the car was a small suitcase, and inside that a tailcoat, watchchain and other faded garments. We&rsquo;d arrive soon after sundown at Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place, the final home of Charles Dickens, and within the hour, dad would be up on stage in the school hall in Victorian costume, gripping a lectern, his body pitched forward as he read to the audience his own rendering of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. We, meanwhile, slid ever deeper into our seats. <br /><br />The voices of the many characters - gnarled and guttural for Scrooge, weak and whiny for Tiny Tim - I remember well. He executed them brilliantly. I also remember the odd gushing fan who&rsquo;d greet him like a rock star once the reading finished. What I wasn&rsquo;t of course aware of was the significance of the text itself. To me, it was just a Christmas story. The characters were richer than those of your average tale, and the story had a better developed moral arc than most. But it was just another Christmas story.<br /><br />Only later did the subversive quality of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, published in December 1843, come into view. Like several of Dickens&rsquo; other works, the book electrified much of Victorian Britain. But it did so for reasons that have been largely forgotten. The origins of <em>A Christmas Carol</em> had nothing to do with Christmas; it arose from an idea Dickens had earlier in 1843 to issue a political pamphlet, &ldquo;An Appeal to the People of England on behalf of the Poor Man&rsquo;s Child&rdquo;, to protest against the exploitation of children sent to work in mines and factories. He was also exercised by the condition of children attending London&rsquo;s Ragged Schools - free institutions for the poor that had been established by charities. Should children be given so much religious instruction in circumstances where the basic needs of food, drink and clothing seemed so much more urgent to address? &ldquo;To impress them, even with the idea of God, when their own condition is so desolate, becomes a monstrous task,&rdquo; he wrote in a published letter.<br /><br />Dickens shelved his first idea of the &ldquo;Appeal&rdquo;, and decided instead to reshape it into a short story and then to link that story with Christmas. The &ldquo;Poor Man&rsquo;s Child&rdquo; became Tiny Tim; Victorian society&rsquo;s spirit of callous laissez-faire was embodied in the grasping misanthrope Ebenezer Scrooge. It was an extraordinary success: 6000 copies sold in one day.<br /><br />&ldquo;Blessings on your kind heart,&rdquo; the Scottish literary critic Francis Jeffery wrote to Dickens soon after reading the short book. &ldquo;You may be sure you have done more good by this little publication, fostered more kindly feelings, and prompted more positive acts of beneficence, than can be traced to all the pulpits and confessionals in Christendom since 1842.&rdquo;</p> <h2>A secularist Victorian bible</h2> <p><em>A Christmas Carol</em> was greeted at the time, informally at least, as something of a secularist bible - or, as Paul Davis writes, &ldquo;the first gospel in the &lsquo;secular scripture&rsquo; of Victorian fiction&rdquo;. Dickens located the story in a smog-filled London at a time when cities, according to the American critic J. Hillis Miller, were &ldquo;the literal representation of the progressive humanization of the world&hellip; The way in which many men have experienced most directly what it means to live without God in the world.&rdquo;<br /><br />That distancing from Christian worship is reflected in the book. Despite occasional mentions of &ldquo;Our Founder&rdquo;, as well as the fact that Dickens was a practising Christian himself, <em>A Christmas Carol</em> steers clear of theological evangelising. The redemption story of Scrooge is a deeply humanistic one, and as such, the book appealed to both churchgoers and agnostics. It therefore stood out at a time when obsession with Christianity was pervasive in the literary world. By the time of Dickens&rsquo; death, half of all monthly periodicals and books were religiously oriented, despite the fact that religion was waning in British society more generally as a result of the rise of evolutionary science and the historical criticism of the Bible that would come a decade or two later.<br /><br />&ldquo;I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round &ndash; apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that &ndash; as a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time,&rdquo; Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew says early on, shunting the religious origin of Christmas into a passing parenthesis and instead emphasising the humanist value and meaning of the festivity. &ldquo;The only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts, freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.&rdquo; <br /><br />I didn&rsquo;t understand, as a child, that in this Christmas tale, Dickens had nailed together the structural edifice of a broad church, one that took ownership of charity away from the pious and made it a public moral duty. His belief was that responsibility for the unfortunate should be democratised - it was everyone&rsquo;s to share. It&rsquo;s a nice thing to remember my father using Christmas to bellow this same message from the lamplit stage.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Former president Donald Trump disembarking from Air Force One (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2GF12N6.jpg" height="467" alt="2GF12N6" width="700" /></p> <p>It is a strange and disturbing thing to notice that after 20 years, we do not have a neat and evocative phrase that can truthfully summarise what the United States has done to the world, and to itself, since 11 September 2001. The commonplace descriptor, used by the press and politicians, has been &ldquo;The War on Terror&rdquo;. Yet this is vague and euphemistic, as it is impossible to wage war on an emotion and even more difficult to declare victory in such a conflict. <br /><br />Flushed with fervour, George Bush Jr initially wanted to describe his wartime actions as a &ldquo;crusade&rdquo;, but quickly backtracked, to the annoyance of his base. With the title of his 2011 book, the British foreign correspondent Jason Burke collected the various bombings, occupations and insurgencies under the banner of <em>The 9/11 Wars</em>, while &ldquo;The Forever War&rdquo; became popular as a means to convey the interminable emotional reality of what America&rsquo;s renewed imperium represents. Yet both of these can only encapsulate what happened on foreign soil, and not what occurred within the borders of the world&rsquo;s superpower.<br /><br />The national security journalist Spencer Ackerman has a different suggestion: &ldquo;If the United States is ever to recover from the destruction it unleashed not only on the world but on itself, and primarily on its most vulnerable, it must first understand the post-9/11 era as nothing other than a reign of terror.&rdquo; This term reconfigures &ldquo;terror&rdquo; as something that was being inflicted as much as it was being &ldquo;fought&rdquo;. Moreover, it captures the kind of power developed by the Bush administration and inherited by its successors: a sacred consensus contemptful of any challenge.<br /><br />A terse and vigorous primer on the last two decades, Ackerman&rsquo;s new book maps the political and cultural trajectory of the Reign of Terror from September 2001 and Bush&rsquo;s &ldquo;shock and awe&rdquo;, through Obama&rsquo;s attempt to craft a &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; war, up until the chaotic end of Trump&rsquo;s presidency. The actions taken in the months and years after 9/11, he writes, &ldquo;echoed the jihadism it sought to destroy: brutal, messianic, aggrieved, censorious, eschatological.&rdquo; One might also add totalising, given that every institution of the state, all wings of the armed forces, the entire political and media class, sport, literature, music, television serials, cafeteria food, cut-price trinkets, bumper stickers, the judiciary and the education system were suborned to the vagaries of a conflict designed to be endless.</p> <h2>The all-seeing power of the NSA</h2> <p>Indeed, in the founding charters of the Reign of Terror &ndash; specifically the Patriot Act, defining the legal tools available to the state, and the Authorisation for the Use of Military Force, granting the president unlimited warmaking powers &ndash; no clear enemy was ever defined. &ldquo;Precision was not something temporarily lost in the wake of [9/11],&rdquo; Ackerman notes, &ldquo;but was a fundamental obstacle to the emerging enterprise.&rdquo; With these weapons in hand, the will to dominate was alluring, and for many of its victims, inescapable. Tucker Carlson, the rightwing shock-jock, ventriloquised many when he suggested that Iraqis, who had the singular bad taste to demand the freedom of their country, ought to &ldquo;just shut the fuck up and obey&rdquo;. <br /><br />Between brief forays into the places which felt the weight of American might (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Libya, Mali and many others), Ackerman details the architecture of an internal regime of repression, roundups and the most penetrating digital panopticon ever built. Run by the NSA, the security state possessed (and still possesses) the capacity to collect any amount of information from anyone, anytime: &ldquo;the first mathematically exponential violation of constitutional rights in American history,&rdquo; as Ackerman puts it. <br /><br />This surveillance behemoth was wedded to a regimented bureaucracy of assassinations and abductions, and a shadow regime of deniable &ldquo;black sites&rdquo; with their own trained-up torturers. &ldquo;Being Muslim in public,&rdquo; Ackerman writes, &ldquo;was treated as a disreputable political act,&rdquo; courtesy of the FBI and their vast network of informants, wiretaps, dragnets and legal threats. A programme of looting shifted $6 trillion to men in uniform and their auxiliary of mercenary &ldquo;contractors&rdquo;. And where did all of those tanks and armoured trucks, helicopters and grenade launchers later resurface? On American streets, often enough, to discipline protestors.</p> <h2>9/11 and the birth of the Trump administration</h2> <p>Throughout <em>Reign of Terror</em>, Ackerman makes a point of mentioning the figures who made their names in the 2000s and would later become superstars of the rolling controversies of the Trump years: Robert Mueller, James Comey, Bill Barr, Jeff Sessions, Jim Mattis and so on. This is because the last third of Ackerman&rsquo;s book makes the case that, by galvanising the Republican right and creating an unimpeachable administration of violence bolstered by liberal complicity, the Reign of Terror &ldquo;produced&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s presidency. &ldquo;A war that never defined its enemy became an opportunity for the so-called MAGA coalition of white Americans to merge their grievances in an atmosphere of righteous emergency. That impulse unlocked a panoply of authoritarian possibilities.&rdquo; <br /><br />True, but not true enough. Missing from this analysis is the deep and morbid social crisis created by the Great Recession of 2007/08, which is under-examined in the book. Those &ldquo;grievances&rdquo; (real or imagined) were as much a product of the 9/11 era as they were the result of a class of Americans, badly hit by the economic crisis, feeling themselves to be increasingly precarious and alienated. <br /><br />Nevertheless, Ackerman shrewdly observes that at critical moments when the Reign of Terror might have been calmed down or cut back, the Democratic Party and many of its supporters moved in the opposite direction, rushing to entrench the security state. When fears grew that Trump might enact a coup or anoint himself a dictator, when the worrying about the structural stability of American democracy reached its peak, who did they appeal to for redemption? The generals, the police, the intelligence &ldquo;community&rdquo;: in short, the Reign of Terror&rsquo;s administrators who had done so much to threaten that democracy in the first instance. <br /><br />There has been no reckoning, in other words. The machinery of the Terror was passed from Trump to Joe Biden fundamentally intact. We continue to live within the grip of what Ackerman stoutly calls &ldquo;a perpetual-motion engine of death&rdquo;.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter edition 2021. </em><a href="/supportus"><span class="s2"><em>Subscribe today</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2021-12-16-at-10.47.26.jpg" height="862" alt="Screenshot-2021-12-16-at-10.47.26" width="1393" /></p> <p>As soon as Christina and Jake Hunger brought their new puppy home, they were utterly smitten. Stella was a tiny eight-week-old Catahoula-Blue Heeler cross, with rich, chocolate-coloured fur, bat ears and a white bib. Stella was a highly engaging little dog, almost frantic with delight every time they entered the room, wagging her tail so hard it set her whole body a-wiggle.<br /><br />Puppies are hard work. There was toilet training, nap times, playtime and lead training. At night, Stella often whimpered until Jake went downstairs to sleep by her bed. But Stella was a quick learner too. Some commands, like &ldquo;Come&rdquo;, were easy. They just bent down and patted their knees and Stella would dash right over.<br /><br />Christina, who works as a speech-language pathologist, was struck by just how precocious her pet was. Sure, Stella was a puppy, but she was also displaying many of the pre-linguistic skills Christina looked for in her nonverbal clients: she maintained eye contact, whined for attention, dropped toys by their feet when she wanted to play, and used gestures to make requests, like pawing at her empty water bowl. Christina started noting down these milestones as she noticed them: already, at two months, Stella was exhibiting over half of the skills a nine-month-old baby might be expected to demonstrate shortly before they begin to say their first words.<br /><br />It wasn&rsquo;t the same. Christina knew that. Stella wouldn&rsquo;t keep passing milestones that would, within months, bring her miraculously into the realm of the verbal the way most infant humans are. Still, it was enough to give her pause.<br /><br />In her job, Christina works with children with developmental issues, finding ways in which they might communicate their wants through non-normative means. This field, known as &ldquo;augmented and alternative communication&rdquo;, or AAC, encompasses many tools and techniques, including sign language and facial expressions, as well as speech-generating devices of the kind used by Stephen Hawking. In AAC, there is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to communicate, no end goal for clients to aim towards; success is successful communication of intent between two parties, however that&rsquo;s achieved. Often she uses iPad apps, allowing her clients to press buttons that enunciate words or phrases on their behalf &ndash; &ldquo;More&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hungry&rdquo;, &ldquo;All done&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Human devices for canine friends</h2> <p>What she likes most about her job is that her clients often surprise both her and their parents with their hidden abilities. Suddenly, children who had seemed oblivious to much of what was going on around them would seize their device and communicate in unexpected bursts, stringing together words they had never before used or even seemed to understand. Sometimes children who seemed to have plateaued would make huge advances once their device was reprogrammed to offer a better range of vocabulary. In this way, Christina had learned never to underestimate how closely someone else might be listening, even if they seemed inattentive or used unusual body language, their verbal speech non-existent.<br /><br />Christina wondered whether Stella could learn to communicate using similar tools. Could a dog use AAC? She didn&rsquo;t see why not. One evening she found a pack of four &ldquo;recordable answer buzzers&rdquo; online &ndash; easy-press buttons intended for use during parlour games, but perfect for Stella. They were palm-sized and easily compressible by a paw or a muzzle. When triggered, each button would sound a short audio clip. Christina programmed the first button to announce &ldquo;Outside&rdquo;. It would be Stella&rsquo;s first word.<br /><br />It took a while for the penny to drop, but after three weeks of Christina and Jake pressing the button with their toe and enunciating the word before opening the door, Stella began to pay it a great deal of attention. Sometimes she would bark at the button, as if willing it to activate itself, or tensely sit by it, waiting for them to press it. Christina recognised this behaviour from the children at work: sometimes a child on the cusp of understanding would take her finger in theirs and use it to press the button on their behalf. It was a good sign: this usually happened very shortly before the child first used the device for themselves.<br /><br />Sure enough, a few nights later, Jake woke Christina. It had happened. They rushed downstairs. Stella did it again. Outside. Outside. She seemed delighted with herself, and when they opened the door in response she ran in ecstatic loops around the garden. Jake and Christina were elated.<br /><br />Since that first button push, Stella has gone on to learn around 50 words: nouns, verbs, adjectives. Christina introduced them slowly and thoughtfully, based largely on her own intuition and her experience of working with children. She also tried to offer Stella what speech-language pathologists call &ldquo;core words&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the words she would use most often. Then, as with the &ldquo;Outside&rdquo; button, she and Jake would faithfully model the new words every time a suitable situation arose. They&rsquo;d press &ldquo;Water&rdquo; right before they refilled her bowl. Or &ldquo;Play&rdquo; before, during and after a game with a toy.<br /><br />Stella&rsquo;s favourites, of course, were &ldquo;Walk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beach&rdquo;, &ldquo;Park&rdquo;. But she also had &ldquo;Help&rdquo;, &ldquo;Love you&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bye&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bed&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cat&rdquo;, &ldquo;Eat&rdquo;, &ldquo;No&rdquo;, &ldquo;Play&rdquo;, &ldquo;Want&rdquo;. Stella was curious and would press buttons to see what happened next. Christina and Jake would enact what the button suggested, and after dozens or hundreds of reinforcements, Stella learned what to expect. Christina wasn&rsquo;t sure that Stella understood the words to mean exactly what we use them to mean, but the connotations were similar. &ldquo;Love you&rdquo; became associated with cuddles, soft voices, sympathetic attention. <br /><br />Christina was working purely to satisfy her own curiosity. But Stella&rsquo;s progress was quick and caught her by surprise. In early interactions, button usage orbited around requests: &ldquo;Outside&rdquo; to go to the toilet, &ldquo;Help&rdquo; to request assistance with a lost toy. As time went on, Stella began to use the buttons in interesting ways. While watching Christina watering houseplants, she pressed &ldquo;Water&rdquo;; when emotionally charged, she tapped buttons repeatedly. She then began to combine words. &ldquo;Eat no&rdquo; one evening when they got home past her usual dinner time. Later on, &ldquo;Come outside&rdquo;. Further down the line, &ldquo;Stella want play&rdquo;.</p> <h2>The limits of a dog&rsquo;s comprehension</h2> <p>Christina isn&rsquo;t the first person to explore the limits of a pet dog&rsquo;s language comprehension. Behavioural psychologist Dr John Pilley once taught the collie Chaser the names of 1,000 toys, and later demonstrated that she understood basic grammar. But Christina&rsquo;s AAC board meant she could study not only Stella&rsquo;s comprehension but her capacity for generating language, for two-way communication. The experiment has been successful far beyond what she ever imagined. Throughout, she has documented Stella&rsquo;s progress online, via her popular Instagram account, @hunger4words, where she has amassed close to 800,000 followers, many of them pet owners keen to try Christina&rsquo;s methods for themselves.<br /><br />Among them is Alexis Devine, an artist based in Tacoma, Washington, who in 2019 bought a bouncy, bed-headed Sheepadoodle (an Old English Sheepdog crossed with a Poodle) called Bunny. She used an AAC system and also began with a simple &ldquo;outside&rdquo; button by the front door. Alexis copied Christina&rsquo;s methods. Over a six-month period she modelled new button usage before combining them into a large wooden &ldquo;keyboard&rdquo; on the floor. Soon she was contacted by Leo Trottier, a cognitive scientist and computer programmer who offered her the use of a prototype canine AAC device, which grouped buttons by type &ndash; activities, objects, places, descriptions &ndash; in a modification of the Fitzgerald Key, a system developed in the early 20th century to help deaf children structure sentences. <br /><br />Since then, Bunny&rsquo;s progress has been even faster than Stella&rsquo;s. Videos posted by Alexis, who has seven million followers on TikTok (@whataboutbunny), show more than 90 buttons arranged on neat hexagonal tiles. In one viral clip, Bunny looks in the mirror and appears to experience an existential crisis. &ldquo;Who this?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;Bunny&rdquo;, Alexis replies. Bunny then walks away and stares through the window before returning to press &ldquo;Help&rdquo;.<br /><br />Amusing as the videos are, the researchers need harder data to work from. The history of cross-species communication study has been plagued with controversy. In one famous early example, a horse called Clever Hans appeared to perform calculations on request, tapping his hoof on the ground to answer questions like, &ldquo;What is three plus four?&rdquo; Hans would perform when asked both by his owner and by strangers, but it became apparent that he was responding not to the rules of mathematics, but to his questioners&rsquo; body language: when he reached the right answer, they would relax, and he would know to stop tapping.</p> <h2>The science of talking animals</h2> <p>Clever Hans&rsquo; owner was not a fraudster &ndash; he was utterly convinced of his horse&rsquo;s genius &ndash; and Hans also took in a number of contemporary scientists. What the case demonstrates is just how difficult it can be to disentangle animal comprehension from their responses to subtle cues. &ldquo;The issues of overinterpretation (ie the human interprets the animal signals as more meaningful than they actually are) and cueing (the animal reproducing sequences acquired through extensive learning or simply responding to cues by the human rather than flexibly producing communicative sequences) have long been discussed as some of the main issues of several other animal language studies,&rdquo; explains Federico Rossano, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, San Diego. He has been studying Bunny&rsquo;s progress as part of the &ldquo;They Can Talk&rdquo; research project, which aims to apply &ldquo;a rigorous scientific approach to determine whether, and if so, how and how much non-humans are able to express themselves in language-like ways.&rdquo; Bunny is only one of 3,000 pets taking part in &ldquo;They Can Talk&rdquo;, in which Rossano, Trottier and others have been analysing the dogs&rsquo; keypad logs and the context in which the buttons are used. <br /><br />The key requirement for them to be classed as language users, in Rossano&rsquo;s opinion, is that the dogs must be able to combine and recombine the various words in different contexts &ndash; that is, not simply asking &ldquo;Where dad?&rdquo;, as Bunny has done when Alexis&rsquo; partner goes to work, but also asking &ldquo;Where mum?&rdquo; when Alexis leaves, and so on. &ldquo;If she repeats or slightly modifies sequences when she does not get a response and clearly orients towards the human while producing the button presses, it would appear more likely that she is trying to communicate something.&rdquo;<br /><br />Rossano and his team have installed five cameras in Alexis&rsquo; house to allow a constant livestream to be beamed to Rossano&rsquo;s lab. &ldquo;Having the cameras on Bunny&rsquo;s board takes some of the pressure off of me feeling like I have to personally record everything,&rdquo; explains Alexis. It also removes any suspicion that she might be selectively editing their interactions. So far, Rossano says, the data is quite convincing. The &ldquo;They Can Talk&rdquo; team is preparing to present their findings to the scientific community. It&rsquo;s important, he says, to &ldquo;retain a healthy scientific scepticism&rdquo;. Nevertheless, &ldquo;the evidence points pretty clearly towards them [the pets in the study] communicating with the humans while using these devices&rdquo;.<br /><br />Alexis too is keen to underline that she does not know exactly how much Bunny understands of their interaction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been open about the importance of scepticism, and the difficulty of avoiding implicit bias from the beginning, and thankfully I personally am not tasked with proving or disproving anything. Our journey is about curiosity, connection and exploring the depths of communication with a non-human animal, and I think that&rsquo;s pretty important regardless of the eventual scientific findings.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Shaping a dog's mind and body</h2> <p>Dog owners are not unbiased parties when it comes to assessing their own pet&rsquo;s mental abilities. This much is obvious. I&rsquo;m a dog owner, and I can tell you this for free. When dog owners speak to one another, we often expound at length upon our pets&rsquo; habits and personalities, their likes and dislikes, even their opinions or dreams. Some of these impressions may well be true. It&rsquo;s also possible, even likely, that we are wrong more often than not.<br />We project a great deal onto our wordless companions, and pride ourselves in playing a protective, even parental, role in their lives. They offer us clues as to their feelings, moods and wants, but we can never truly know what they are thinking. Maybe that&rsquo;s for the best: &ldquo;no small amount of dogs&rsquo; winsomeness is the empathy that we can attribute to them as they silently contemplate us,&rdquo; wrote the cognitive scientist Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, in <em>Inside of a Dog</em>.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the relationship between dog and human is unusually close thanks to an estimated 11,000 years of domestication. We feed them, care for them and breed them selectively for friendliness and other useful traits. We have shaped almost every attribute of their bodies and minds. They live in our homes and play important roles in many industries. In various ways, dogs have shaped us too.<br /><br />If any animal was likely to excel at communication with humans, it would be the dog. Yet until now, there has been surprisingly little study of them. Past animal communication researchers have instead opted for gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and even dolphins. But monkeys and apes, for all their human-like characteristics, are notoriously erratic, even aggressive. Dolphins, being water-based, bring myriad logistical problems. Dogs, meanwhile, are domestic companions, unusually easy to train, responsive to human commands and body language, and are often &ndash; but not invariably &ndash; keen to please. For these reasons, the Soviet space programme, unlike Nasa&rsquo;s, opted to use dogs in early rocket launches after circus trainers warned them that monkeys were too temperamental to be useful. <br /><br />Their attentiveness and intelligence is part of what makes dogs so appealing, but our love for them is also part of the reason why it&rsquo;s so difficult to lay aside scepticism. &ldquo;It is not the animals who desire to speak and cannot, I suspect; it is that we desire them to talk and cannot effect it,&rdquo; writes Horowitz. In past interviews, Horowitz has called for research to focus on dogs&rsquo; natural modes of communication and behaviour, rather on their capacity to learn or respond to ours. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s difficult not to get excited by Bunny and Stella&rsquo;s conversational prowess, and the small glimmers they offer us as to how canine minds might work.<br /><br />We may never know if the dogs are using and comprehending human language to mean exactly the same as we do. But if nothing else, it gives us a great deal of insight into our relationship with them as a species, their concerns and their personalities. As for my own dog, I haven&rsquo;t yet tried to teach her to speak. I very much want to learn her innermost desires, but I suspect she has little interest in communicating with me on my own terms. If she did, I imagine it might closely resemble the one-track conversation of scrappy Bastian, a rescued terrier in New York City (@bastianandbrews), who will scratch the relevant buttons repeatedly until their covers fly off. &ldquo;Hungry hungry hungry hungry,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;food food food food treat treat treat treat food food food.&rdquo;<br /><br />Still, who can blame him? I think I can relate.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="US coins were inscribed with 'In God We Trust' following the US Civil War (image taken from QuoteInspector.com)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/money-qi57-md.jpg" height="480" alt="money-qi57-md" width="720" /></p> <p>The First Amendment to the US Constitution prevents the government from making laws designed to regulate the establishment of any religion, or that would prohibit the free exercise of religion. Yet the US remains a decidedly "Christian" nation. Nearly all US Presidents have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/20/biden-only-second-catholic-president-but-nearly-all-have-been-christians-2/">professed</a> to follow some form of the Christian faith. Only Presidents Lincoln and Jefferson have claimed no religious affiliation. <br /><br />Historically, the sitting president's personal faith has been reflected in the overall populace. The Public Religion Research Institute <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/">notes</a> that 70 per cent of Americans identify as Christian, and 5 per cent identify with non-Christian religions. Nearly a quarter are religiously unaffiliated. <br /><br />Given the preponderance of US citizens who claim to be Christians, how is this ideal of the separation of church and state enacted within the public square? Rob Boston, Director of Communications at <a href="https://www.au.org/">Americans United</a>, a nonpartisan educational and advocacy organization dedicated to advancing the separation of religion and government, explains that while the United States operates under the separation of church and state, &ldquo;there has always been something of a carve out for what scholars call &lsquo;civil religion&rsquo; &ndash; that is, the tendency of government and political leaders to use religion (usually in a generic sense) to buttress perceived national goals.&rdquo; <br /><br />Perhaps the most explicit recent example of this came during the Trump administration. Throughout his time in office, Trump <a href="https://thehumanist.com/commentary/let-us-say-its-time-to-end-the-national-prayer-breakfast">displayed</a> a politicised version of Christianity that contained a toxic mixture of conservative white evangelicalism, prosperity gospel preaching, and Christian nationalism. His policies were not reflective of the will of the majority of Americans but instead tended to reflect his Christian nationalist policy goals. <br /><br />Upon initial glance, the Biden administration may present itself as less outwardly "religious" than Trump&rsquo;s. For instance, as <a href="https://religiondispatches.org/2021-national-prayer-breakfast-a-kinder-gentler-form-of-christian-capitalism/">reported</a> at Religion Dispatches, during the 2021 National Prayer Breakfast, President Joe Biden offered a bipartisan message of national unity and faith in light of the January 6 Capitol insurrection, with even Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-addresses-national-prayer-breakfast">highlighting</a> Biden&rsquo;s call to end &ldquo;political extremism.&rdquo; <br /><br />Yet Biden&rsquo;s endorsement by progressive faith leaders, as well as events like the virtual <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2020/09/04/biden-campaign-launches-catholic-voter-outreach-initiative">Catholics for Biden</a> voter outreach campaign and the rise of organizations like Evangelicals for Biden and The New Moral Majority point to the continued infusion of faith and politics within the US administration. It may manifest in a somewhat kinder, gentler expression, yet the ongoing problematic practice of &ldquo;civil religion", in which an administration&rsquo;s national policy agenda is influenced by its religious orientation, remains in place. </p> <h2>Politicians, prayer and "God talk"</h2> <p>For decades, American civil religion has been seen most visibly through the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual gathering of US politicians, pastors and industry leaders. Despite the fact that it is sponsored by a secretive private Christian group titled The Family (aka The Fellowship Foundation), invitations are issued on congressional letterhead and the press secure their access via the White House. Ever since President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered the inaugural address in 1953, every US president has addressed this gathering. <br /><br />During the Eisenhower era from 1953 to 1961, Christianity became identified as the country's overall civil religion. &ldquo;Under God&rdquo; became part of the Pledge of Allegiance, and &ldquo;In God We Trust&rdquo; was added to the US paper currency (and to US coins after the Civil War). Politicians regularly employ &ldquo;God talk&rdquo; in speeches, call on Americans to pray during times of crisis or uncertainty, and offer prayers before meetings of local, state, and federal governments. <br /><br />The Supreme Court of the United States has issued rulings in favour of church and state separation, including <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale">banning prayer in public schools</a> or <a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/37/bob-jones-university-v-united-states">permitting</a> the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to deny tax-exempt status to institutions whose policies are &ldquo;contrary to established public policy,&rdquo; even if those policies are based on religious beliefs. However, as Rob Boston has noted, US Courts have also ruled that certain forms of &ldquo;civil religion" are legal. This can be seen in court rulings granting individuals exemptions based on religious beliefs to, for example, the government-mandated Covid-19 <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/courts-clash-over-religious-exemptions-for-vaccine-mandates">vaccine</a>. "Given the current conservative cast of the Supreme Court, that is not likely to change anytime soon," Boston says. <br /><br />Christian pastors and leading faith-based institutions can, according to Boston, endorse candidates for public office in their private capacities. However, they are not legally allowed to use the resources of their houses of worship or faith-based nonprofit to support or oppose a political candidate, nor are they permitted to issue statements of support or opposition from the pulpit. All the same, the IRS has not, in a number of years, penalised those churches who use their pulpit for political purposes. The last <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/senator-grassley-and-the-televangelists/">attempt</a> by Congress in 2007 to force ministries to provide greater fiscal accountability failed to garner traction. <br /><br />While political candidates and elected officials can and should hear from faith communities about their concerns and views on social issues, public officials should be careful to include diverse faith and secular voices in discussions on public policy. Boston cites as one example former President Trump's creation of an Evangelical Advisory Board that was not inclusive of the full spectrum of faith and nonreligious communities in America. <br /><br />Despite now being out of the presidency, Trump's public support among white evangelicals continues to rise in part due to his ongoing support of faith-based <a href="https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/articles/why-white-evangelicals-stuck-trump">issues</a> that matter to evangelical leaders, such as abortion and religious freedom. White evangelicals in the pews also remain attracted to Republican positions on the economy, national security, and immigration. According to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">Pew Research Center</a>, 77 per cent of this demographic supported Trump in 2016, a number that increased to 84 per cent in 2020.</p> <h2>The rise of the irreligious US voting bloc</h2> <p>While these debates continue to rage, the religious composition of the US continues to grow more pluralistic. &ldquo;Nones&rdquo; &ndash; people who profess no religious affiliation - <a href="https://thehumanist.com/commentary/debunking-rise-democratic-christian-voters">represent</a> 24 per cent of US voters. As the Pew Research Center has noted, Biden's win can be attributed in part to the fact that more atheists and agnostics voted for him in 2020 than they did Hillary Clinton in 2016. <br /><br />Most politicians remain entrenched in their old patterns, and despite a 2019 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/no-religion-largest-group-first-time-usa-trnd/index.html">survey</a> finding that there are as many nonreligious Americans as there are Catholics or evangelicals, they continue to engage in efforts to reach the faithful in the pews. To date, neither the Democrats or Republicans have launched any significant initiatives to target the growing voting block that professes no religious affiliation. <br /><br />The US electorate is changing. It&rsquo;s time the political establishment took note and responded to the will of the people and not their faith-based funding streams.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
