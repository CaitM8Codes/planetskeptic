<p class="lead"><i>Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch&#8217;entrate</i> should have been inscribed on the exit doors of the Phoenix airport. Tremble and weep in horror at this <a href="https://leftcoastrightwatch.org/2021/12/i-spent-a-weekend-at-a-fascist-youth-conference-so-you-wouldnt-have-to/">thorough description of the Turning Point USA conference</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Twas the weekend before Christmas when Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA hosted a massive, sold-out 4-day conservative youth conference featuring 10,000 teens and young adults screaming for Dennis Prager, the Fox News lineup, January 6-plotting politicians, a dancing James O’Keefe, and former active shooter Kyle Rittenhouse in Phoenix, AZ. AmericaFest was located in the same building where Arizona holds it’s yearly ComicCon and the layout was eerily similar. It featured an exhibitor hall filled with merch booths and meet-n-greets, except instead of getting a picture with Spider-Man one could get a picture with Jack “Pizzagate” Posobiec or accused child trafficker Rep. Matt Gaetz. Instead of buying an overpriced Street Fighter figurine, you could buy an $500 bedazzled gun purse or “invest” in Let’s Go Brandon cryptocurrency. Tickets for this mega conference reached up to $750, with people flying in from all over the country to see their favorite TPUSA-sponsored influencer preaching the benefits of white Christian American hypercapitalism. Hotels in the nearby area offered package deals so the entire downtown area was overrun with 20-somethings in blue and hot pink tailored suits and Trump hats for the entire long weekend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hate is as popular as comic books, I guess. You couldn&#8217;t pay me to set foot in that hall.</p>
<blockquote><p>Religion, and more specifically Christian supremacy, was present throughout the weekend. Lining the street leading up to the conference, men with graphic anti-choice signs handed out pamphlets for AbortionNO. Turning Point Faith was a co-sponsor of the conference and had a large booth with free merch advocating for the merging of politics and religion, speeches throughout the weekend often spread a similar message. Creepy fetus dolls were on display and fetal development commercials played in between speakers, followed by “BUY GOLD! BUY SILVER!” Anti-choice activist Abby Johnson was a speaker, hosted panels on “how to fight abortion,” and also had a massive merch booth for her “Pro-Love Ministries.” Johnson has previously advocated for “household voting” where only the husband can vote and said that it would be “smart” for the police to racially profile her biracial son. Give Send Go, the Christian supremacist crowdfunding site that platforms white nationalists and other extremist groups also had a merch and prayer booth while the co-founder Jacob Wells joined a reception across the street with an organization with ties to neo-Nazis (more on that later).</p></blockquote>
<p>Has white nationalism infected religion, or is religion tainting white nationalism? I can&#8217;t tell anymore. They&#8217;ve long been entangled, and this is just the emergence of a particularly virulent mutant strain of both.</p>
<blockquote><p>Similar brochures were given out on “gender identity” but explicit transphobia was an ongoing theme from many of the speakers as well. Charlie Kirk took the stage multiple times during his event and demonizing trans people was one of his most repeated points. Dennis Prager lead the crowd in booing trans athletes and he rejected the term “transphobic” entirely, claiming it’s a “meaningless phrase,” implying that trans men, women, and nonbinary people do not exist at all. The one transgender joke conservatives have was repeated countless times this weekend. Nothing can truly describe the pure hate in the crowd any time trans people were mentioned. There were 10,000 young adults frothing at the mouth and scapegoating a tiny and extremely marginalized community for all of their perceived problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>How transphobic is Charlie Kirk? This transphobic.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I truly cannot describe how endlessly transphobic this morning has been so far. Charlie Kirk barely let Sarah Palin speak and instead used the hour to demonize trans people in absolutely every disgusting way possible.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Horrible as that was, I&#8217;m going to have to nominate the Rittenhouse moment as the low point of the event.</p>
<blockquote><p>Day three of the convention was noticeably the busiest despite being on a Monday. Charlie Kirk endlessly bragged about how the arena, capable of seating up to 10,000 was filled to capacity. Kyle Rittenhouse was going to take the stage and his appearance was the already the topic of conversation all weekend. The day before, in the snack line, I listened to two teenagers who were giddy in excitement over seeing Rittenhouse, talking about his recent appearance on Louder With Crowder. Rep. Lauren Boebert swooned over Rittenhouse during her speech and later appeared in a photo with him backstage. He was billed as “a VERY special guest” alongside Jack Posobiec, Drew Hernandez, and Elijah Schaffer. Before walking out, the three large screens played scenes from Tucker Carlson’s special on Rittenhouse. The crowd stood to attention and cheered as Kyle appeared on screen then booed and laughed when his victims, Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber, and Gaige Grosskreutz came on, including the graphic images of their death and injuries. The clip of Rittenhouse crying on the stand was met with shouts of “we love you Kyle!” He took the stage to flashes of red, white, and blue filling the room as a Kyle Rittenhouse-themed rap song blasted. The screaming was deafening as they chanted his name. A young teenager behind me couldn’t stop repeating “based, based, based.”</p></blockquote>
<p>They showed gory images of the dead and wounded…and the audience <em>laughed</em> about it? Jesus. There&#8217;s a crop of young men and women I don&#8217;t want to ever meet.</p>
<p>Is this America? Or is this Hell?</p>

<p class="lead">Sam Harris has an explanation for why <em>some</em> people (but not him, oh no, don&#8217;t accuse him of being so seduced by an all-encompassing bias that he would become an anti-vaxxer) would fall for anti-scientific ideas: the Woke made them do it. Wokeness is infuriating, don&#8217;t you know, so infuriating that it makes people abandon reason.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Might be as simple as: The establishment has been captured by an infuriating ideology (wokeness) which is contaminating even the most basic scientific and medical communication. So&#8230; now I will trust only non-standard sources of information and look for conspiracies everywhere.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sam Harris (@SamHarrisOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/1475369713165221888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This, of course, makes no sense, but then many of Harris&#8217;s rationalizations don&#8217;t hold up to inspection. What is this ideology of wokeness that he is blaming for everything? It seems to be vaguely defined as a recognition that there is injustice in the world (patently true), and that systems of power tend to perpetuate that injustice (also true, but a more complex issue that may we could argue about nuances over). But blaming the people you disagree with for driving you into more extreme positions, of radicalizing you, is bogus. Your position is yours. You can&#8217;t blame others for it.</p>
<p>Would Harris accept it if an Islamic fundamentalist said, &#8220;The establishment has been captured by an infuriating ideology (secularism) which is contaminating even the most basic scientific and medical communication. So&#8230; now I will trust only my imam&#8221;? That logic takes extremism off the hook.</p>
<p>Or &#8220;The establishment has been captured by an infuriating ideology (atheism) which is contaminating even the most basic scientific and medical communication. So&#8230; now I will trust only my Bible&#8221;? We can play this game of opposites all day, constantly claiming that the contrary position made me do it. It makes it easy to take disagreement as affirmation.</p>
<p>Also, the purpose of this illogical argument is crystal clear. Harris himself is a member of an ideological tribe, these IDW conservatives, through which the disease of science denialism and anti-vax nonsense is sweeping. See Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying and Joe Rogan for examples, also note that Jordan Peterson has joined the party.</p>

<p>With all of his good buddies embracing the anti-science banner, poor Sam Harris is in the position of having to make excuses for the irrationality of his clique. Sure, the Woke made them do it!</p>
<p>Does he even realize how familiar this religious argument sounds?</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="Claire Tomalin (copyright: Angus Muir)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Claire-Tomalin-NEW-2011-credit-Angus-Muir.jpg" height="851" width="1277" /></em></p> <p><em>Claire Tomalin was the literary editor at the </em>New Statesman<em>, and then later at the </em>Sunday Times<em>. She then embarked on successful career as a full-time writer. Her first book, "The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft", won the Whitbread First Book Award, and she has since written a number of highly acclaimed, award-winning and bestselling biographies. They include: "Jane Austen: A Life", and "Charles Dickens: A Life". Tomalin's latest book is "The Young H.G. Wells: Changing the World".</em></p> <p><strong>As a teenager, at Uppark, Sussex, H.G. Wells had the good fortune of discovering the work of many great writers and thinkers. How important was that formative moment in shaping his artistic and intellectual abilities later on?</strong></p> <p>The experience of finding those books at Uppark was absolutely crucial in Wells's life. His mother was a servant in a gentry country house there. And when visiting his mother, Wells suddenly found he had access to an extraordinary range of books from the library he found in the servants&rsquo; quarters. He discovered the works of Plato, Voltaire, Thomas Paine, and Jonathan Swift. One of the fascinating things about Wells is that he came from poverty. But this formative reading moment opened up his mind to a whole new world of ideas and possibilities.</p> <p><strong>Was Wells a working class hero?</strong></p> <p>He knew that he was getting out of the working class. He said to his mother: "If you could make me be a draper's apprentice, then I will stay as a draper's apprentice forever, but if you let me go to school and study at university, I will rise up." And that is what happened.</p> <p><strong>Wells is often credited as being a kind of father figure for the science fiction genre. Why were books like <em>The Time Machine</em> (1895) and <em>The War of the Worlds</em> (1898) considered so fresh and modern at the time they were published?</strong></p> <p>They are just marvellous stories that are vividly and plainly well written. Wells also had an extraordinary imagination. He deserves to be regarded as a great, great English storyteller.</p> <p><strong>Many critics often draw distinctions between Wells's science fiction work and his literary realism. The general consensus seems to be the science fiction was far better. Do you agree?</strong></p> <p>A book like <em>Joan and Peter </em>(1918), for example, is okay, but it's much more like a conventional English novel, and doesn't approach the thrill of those early [science fiction stories]. Why that happened I cannot say. I suppose Wells just got old and lost his sparkle.</p> <p><strong>Wells also wrote a great deal of polemical non-fiction. Your biography look at books like <em>Anticipations </em>(1901), where Wells was making a claim to forecast the future in areas like transport, social activities, education, and warfare. And <em>Misery Boots</em> (1907): a political tract advocating socialism. Were these two books his strongest works of non-fiction?</strong></p> <p><em>Misery Boots</em> is a wonderful political pamphlet. And <em>Anticipations</em> is absolutely terrific too. I wouldn't be able to say which is the best. They are just all very interesting and impressive. When people like George Bernard Shaw, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb read Wells, they realised how extraordinary he was. Which is why they were so keen to get him into the Fabian Society.</p> <p><strong>Wells's relationship with the Fabian Society was controversial. Why did he fall out with them?</strong></p> <p>He was overly ambitious. He wanted to to enlarge The Fabian Society, and he wanted to change it by spending a lot of money. But Beatrice and Sidney Webb [who were early members of the organisation], and many others, realised this was not a realistic scheme. The Fabian Society was very influential. But it wasn't rich. So that was part of the problem. And then Wells had an affair with Amber Reeves, who was a the daughter of William Pember Reeves and Maud Pember Reeves: two prominent members of the Fabian Society. This sexual scandal was regarded as unacceptable.</p> <p><strong>Wells married twice, first to his cousin, Isabel Mary Wells, before beginning an affair with Amy Catherine Robbins, who he later married. But Wells had many other lovers throughout his life. Could he be cruel in love, or did he just have a very open attitude to relationships and sex?</strong></p> <p>I think Wells didn't mean to be cruel to the women he was with. But he did have this very powerful attraction to women. He was also absolutely insistent on having sexual freedom. Wells wanted everything. He wanted to have a lovely loyal wife, who could entertain his friends at home. But he also wanted to have a passionate love affairs. Actually, he got most of what he wanted.</p> <p><strong>Was there one particular romantic affair Wells embarked on that stands out to you as especially passionate or intense?</strong></p> <p>The affair with the English writer, Rebecca West, was very long drawn out, and probably the most intense affair of Wells's life. That's partially why I stopped the book before that period of his life. It's a whole new chapter, and that's been written about, in depth, by many people. And, of course, West was such a powerful woman herself. But Wells's affair with Amber Reeves was very interesting too. She was this beautiful young student at Cambridge. She really initiated the affair, and asked Wells to make her pregnant. If you read the letters between both of them they are extraordinary. Long afterwards, when she was happily married, she always retained her feelings for him.</p> <p><strong>Wells's bibliography contains an impressive 3,000 items, including more than 100 books. He was quite a hard worker and extremely prolific with his pen it seems?</strong></p> <p>At one stage of his writing career Wells was churning out 7,000 words a day. It almost seemed like he had a team of writers working for him. This was an extraordinary side to his working life: how much writing he actually produced. He also had the capacity to do lots of other things. He had an intense energy. As well as writing, he was engaged in all sorts of travel. And, of course, he was engaged in many relationships with many different women.</p> <p><strong>You've written biographies documenting the lives of writers like Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Thomas Hardy. How does Wells's life compare to them? Was it more eventful and interesting?</strong></p> <p>Well my first biography was on the life of Mary Wollstonecraft. She had a pretty eventful life. So too did Charles Dickens. I've enjoyed writing about Wells, but I'm not sure if his life was more interesting than any of the other writers I've written about. Wells lived through very interesting times. But then so too did those other writers I've written about.</p> <p><strong>What is the secret to writing a great biography?</strong></p> <p>Each biography one embarks on is like forming a close friendship, or close relationship, and trying to be as understanding and tolerant as you can, so you can then investigate as much as you can into that person's life. Of course, you can't catch everything. Nobody can catch everything about another person's life.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>(I think the gag about the government putting a bag over your head is part of the metaphor.)</p>
<p>I watched it last night, and I liked it in a grim, cynical, we-are-so-fucked sort of way. The story in the movie is about our response to learning that a planet-killing comet is going to smash into the Earth in six months, which is a nice, sharp, discretely bounded example of a catastrophe, so it does differ from our current situation where the oncoming catastrophe is messy and slow. It makes no difference, though, since we&#8217;d probably react to either kind of disaster with ineffectual denial. (Probably? In the case of our current situation, definitely.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/21/opinion/global-destruction-isnt-funny-when-it-comes-climate-crisis-it-might-have-be/?event=event25">Michael Mann appreciated the message of the movie</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>McKay’s film succeeds not because it’s funny and entertaining; it’s serious sociopolitical commentary posing as comedy. It’s a cautionary tale about the climate crisis stitched together by McKay’s signature biting humor. That’s the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down.</p>
<p>As we look toward the next decade — a critical decade from the standpoint of averting truly catastrophic climate change — we need more unconventional endeavors like “Don’t Look Up” to communicate the perils of climate inaction. Scientific research, on its own, will travel only so far (until scientists distill a 900-page report into a 90-second TikTok). Science isn’t finished until it’s successfully communicated.</p>
<p>As Beth Osnes, associate professor of theater and environmental studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said, “Climate change isn’t a laughing matter, but sometimes you have to laugh at your pain to get to a solution.” So let’s stop to have a laugh or two. And then get on with the work at hand.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think he&#8217;s right, but we also have to appreciate how hard it&#8217;s going to be. The movie made that obvious: even when our doom was obvious, when there was a comet hanging in the sky, there were still people scheming to use it for political gain or corporate greed. The signs and portents of our troubles are all around us, yet we still have conservative think-tanks denying the need to take action because it might interfere with corporate profits, and we have a political party that&#8217;s <i>raison d&#8217;etre</i> seems to be about disenfranchising the citizenry because they might vote against greed and exploitation. What <em>is</em> the work at hand? It&#8217;s not just doing good science, it also seems to require crushing a corrupt political party, replacing a negligent one, and dismantling all of capitalism. It&#8217;s all a bit overwhelming.</p>

<p>In the early years of this blog, way back in the 2000s, I felt a bit of frustration and despair because when I looked at the surveys, all I saw then was a flat line: less than half the population accepted a well-supported scientific fact, and 40% openly rejected it in favor of nonsense contradicted by all the evidence. And the statistics were flat-lined back into the 1960s, when the surveys began! It was all very discouraging, but also motivated a lot of us to get out there and do public science communication. It seems to have worked.</p>
<p>At least, I think educating the public helped. Another factor is that evolution has also become a tribal marker. If you&#8217;re a True Republican, you believe in bullshit and the American way; if you&#8217;re a True Democrat, you believe in evolution and science. Part of the reason for the growing disparity is simply growing polarization.</p>
<blockquote><p>Antievolutionism remains a political force. The Republican party often panders to religious fundamentalism, and attitudes toward evolution are politicized as a result. Miller and his collaborators found that 34% of conservative Republicans accepted evolution in 2019, as compared to 83% of liberal Democrats. There is evidence that the politicization is increasing: in 2009, 54% of Republicans and 64% of Democrats accepted human evolution, but by 2013, the ten-point gap widened to a twenty-four-point gap, according to the Pew Research Center.</p></blockquote>
<p>That tells me it&#8217;s just as important as ever to work to make sure citizens accept evolution for the <em>right</em> reasons. Because that&#8217;s what the evidence supports.</p>

At many points, it felt as if the doomed 2020 had stretched well into 2021. The media continued to bear bad news, and reflections on the experience of grief, isolation, polarisation and other features of our social landscape continued to surface in everyday discussions. But so too did stories of hope and empowerment, along with heartening developments in science and technology. At <em>New Humanist</em>, we continued to shine a light on worrying trends in our "post-truth" era, championing reason and free inquiry at a time when these principles are under great threat. In our Top 20 articles of the year, our authors engage with these themes and much more. We have also included episodes from our podcast <a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061"><em>With Reason</em></a>. We hope you enjoy these as much as we have.</p> <p>***</p> <p>1. <a href="/articles/5841/blasphemy-in-the-classroom">Blasphemy in the classroom</a> by Emma Park</p> <p>In March, a grammar school in Kent was targeted by protestors angry at a teacher's showing of a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad. Soon after, Emma Park began to reflect on what this said about the state of free expression in Britain, and the all important question of how religious iconography is differently interpreted.</p> <p>3. <a href="/articles/5891/of-beasts-and-men">Of beasts and men</a> by Julian Baggini</p> <p>Parliament has been debating an Animal Sentience Bill that could finally see animals officially recognised as sentient creatures. It's high time this happened, Julian Baggini writes, but it doesn't provide the basis for an argument that meat-eating is a special kind of evil.</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NEW_HUMANIST_WINTER_2v1aw2small.jpg" height="372" alt="NEW_HUMANIST_WINTER_2v1aw2small" width="494" /></p> <p>4. <a href="/articles/5802/our-national-need-for-grief">Our national need for grief</a> by Samira Ahmed</p> <p>The pandemic cast a huge blanket of grief over Britain. Yet it feels like the tens of thousands of sudden deaths haven't been properly marked.</p> <p>5. <a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/4398ad6427f6c3a8207b3ed667934a4b78058210/view">Writing and recovery</a>: an interview with Michael Rosen</p> <p>In early 2020, the poet and author Michael Rosen almost died from Covid-19. He used his recuperation to reflect on the value of kindness, touch and practical atheism, and later spoke with New Humanist about the immorality of government decision-making around the pandemic.</p> <p>6. <a href="/articles/5784/talking-to-ourselves">Talking to Ourselves</a> by Jon Moses</p> <p>When we pay them heed, our inner voices can shape our lives. They tell us what we should think, and how we should behave. But, writes Jon Moses, they have long been understudied. Should that change?</p> <p>7. <a href="/articles/5859/power-shapes-human-health-and-infectious-diseases-shape-power">Disease and power</a>: a Q&amp;A with Kyle Harper</p> <p>Several transformations in human history - the development of agriculture, the rise of cities, international travel - triggered profound changes in the way diseases evolve and pass between humans. Dr Kyle Harper, author of <em>Plagues Upon the Earth: Disease and the Course of Human History, </em>gave us an overview of how we have shaped disease, and how it has shaped us.</p> <p>8. <a href="/articles/5827/lying-eyes">Lying Eyes</a> by Gayan Samarisinghe</p> <p>Judges, juries, prosecutors and courtroom audiences can't but help look at the expressions of defendents to glean clues as to their guilt or innocence. But this is not only unscientific, writes Gayan Samarisinghe. It is a major cause of bias in criminal trials.</p> <p>2. <a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/9ecf3706689beab926e28b8ce15b6ca0f96fcf91/view">How to fix the internet</a>: an interview with Chris Bail</p> <p>Online tribalism is a growing threat, with real implications for offline safety. Chris Bail, head of the Polarization Lab, shared his thoughts on what strategies can best be used to tackle the problem.</p> <p>9. <a href="/articles/5846/why-does-every-hollywood-baddie-need-a-redemption-story">Scraping the Barrel</a> by James Robins</p> <p>A Hollywood film on the life and times of Cruella de Ville has flattened a complex villain into a likeable, redeemable character. But why do directors need to deliver feelgood stories, James Robins asks?</p> <p>10. <a href="/articles/5899/the-curious-mind-of-a-dog">The curious mind of a dog</a> by Cal Flyn</p> <p>Several years ago, a speech pathologist began to wonder whether the strategies she uses to develop language skills in her young patients could be adapted in order to train dogs to "talk". As Cal Flyn found out, the results have been astonishing.</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistDog-small1.jpg" height="480" alt="NewHumanistDog-small1" width="535" /></p> <p>11. <a href="/articles/5857/a-good-death">A good death</a> by Jem Bartholomew</p> <p>Current laws around assisted dying in the UK mean that people who want to legally and painlessly end their lives have to travel abroad. But the tide is beginning to turn, writes Jem Bartholomew in a feature on the life, and death, of Rebecca Drury.</p> <p>12. <a href="/articles/5763/inside-diyarbak%C4%B1r-the-city-of-the-silenced">Inside Diyarbakir, the city of the silenced</a> by Sami Kent</p> <p>Diyarbakir is Turkey&rsquo;s biggest Kurdish city, and its recent history is one marked by violence and unrelenting state oppression. But it also where the development of a recognisably 21st-century Kurdish city has found powerful expression, as Sami Kent discovered.</p> <p>13. <a href="/articles/5821/qa-ac-grayling">Q&amp;A with A.C. Grayling</a> by Niki Seth-Smith</p> <p>"I&rsquo;ve always said that humanism is an ethical outlook," A.C. Grayling told us earlier this year, "which has its roots in Classical antiquity and which pretty well all reflective people have held close, right the way through the history of philosophy."</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/oz1.jpg" height="432" alt="oz1" width="532" /></p> <p>14. <a href="/articles/5773/australias-dance-with-death">Australia's dance with death</a> by Peter Salmon</p> <p>As with neurosis in an individual&rsquo;s psyche, Peter Salmon reflected, a neurosis in the psyche of a nation can battle on, impervious to the facts. Australia's position on looming environmental collapse is just such an example.</p> <p>15. <a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/646f1bfd4c2adf1ec42391021aafc62ee374200f/view">The Cosmos &amp; Us</a>: an interview with Jo Marchant</p> <p>What do we gain when we look to the skies? How has cosmology shaped our politics? And why is awe a feeling that we can&rsquo;t afford to lose? We spoke about this, and more, in a podcast with the science writer Jo Marchant.</p> <p>16. <a href="/articles/5816/remember-me">Remember me</a> by Laurie Taylor</p> <p>Laurie Taylor spent much of the past year contacting old pals in the hope that long-dead friendships could be reborn. For the most part, he was wildly unsuccessful, and he came to learn a hard truth: they had gotten on just fine without him.</p> <p>17. <a href="/articles/5900/qa-eimear-mcbride">Q&amp;A with Eimear McBride</a> by J. P. O'Malley</p> <p>The Irish novelist, whose book <em>A Girl Is A Half-formed Thing</em> won the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize in 2013, spoke to us about objectification and disgust in representations of, and conversations around, women's bodies.</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Eimar_McBride_&copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall1.jpg" height="328" alt="Eimar_McBride_&copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall1" width="492" /></p> <p>18. <a href="/articles/5854/patron-saint-of-doom">Patron saint of doom</a> by Tom Whyman</p> <p>Like many of us, Tom Whyman found the pandemic period to be full of dispiriting news. But after returning to the work of Arthur Schopenhauer, he understood that hope lay in properly interrogating the pessimistic mind.</p> <p>19. <a href="/articles/5831/secrets-in-the-soil">Secrets in the soil</a> by Kate Brown</p> <p>Our problem of ravaged soils is one of the oldest in the history of agriculture. But having tried her hand at farming on disturbed urban territory, Kate Brown found reason to be optimistic about the future of the ground beneath our feet.</p> <p>20. <a href="/articles/5847/shutting-down-websites-used-by-sex-workers-is-part-of-a-dangerous-trend">Adult enterprise</a> by Ray Filar</p> <p>Some anti-sex-worker campaigners believe that criminalisation will &ldquo;end demand&rdquo; from would-be sex buyers. Part of this push is the shutting down of websites used by sex workers. But, as Ray Filar discovered, resistance against this campaign is growing.</p> <p>To all of our readers: <em>Felice anno nuovo!</em></p> <p>And to those of you who don't yet subscribe, why not head into 2022 with a fresh new subscription to <em>New Humanist </em>magazine.

Both in Latin and French, God was talked of as a &ldquo;refuge&rdquo;, a protector. Geoffrey Chaucer often marks an arrival of a French word into common English usage. In his <em>Knight&rsquo;s Tale</em> (c.1405), we find the phrase, &ldquo;Give us neither mercy nor refuge, but slay me&rdquo; (modernised spelling).</p> <p class="p4">The Oxford Dictionary lists the first example of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in the modern sense, attached to Protestants who fled religious persecution in France, especially after 1685 and the Edict of Nantes. In 1687, John Evelyn, in his famous <em>Diary, </em>wrote of &ldquo;the poor and religious Refugie&egrave;s [sic] who escaped out of France in the cruel persecution&rdquo;. Even so, a little earlier there are references to &ldquo;poor refugees in Norwich, Colchester, Sandwich, Maidstone and Southampton&rdquo;, a reminder that places some think of as &ldquo;pure English&rdquo; (whatever that means) have had their share of migrants from as far back as the 17th century. Daniel Defoe used the word in 1724, presumably in the knowledge that his readers were familiar with it, talking of &ldquo;the people call&rsquo;d refugees&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p4">In the slippery way that we all enjoy, we find writers using the word metaphorically or hyperbolically. A migratory bird could be described as a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; (1764); Lawrence Durrell, in <em>Justine</em> (1957), wrote: &ldquo;You are a mental refugee of course, being Irish.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">As we know only too well, the word can also be used in an inversion of its customary sense when the person is deemed unworthy: a refugee from the law and due punishment. This idea has been around since at least the 18th century. One Lady Miller, writing in 1777, first described refugees as &ldquo;robbers and murderers&rdquo;, before adding: &ldquo;The soldiers seize the refugees and bring them to justice.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">What&rsquo;s not clear from Lady Miller&rsquo;s writing is whether this outcome was better or worse than having your dinghy turned round in the English Channel in 2021 and sent back to France.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Looking wan and tense, Githa talked about her growth as a writer, from her Commonwealth Award-winning debut, <em>The Thousand Faces of Night</em>, to her latest novel, <em>I Have Become the Tide</em>, which deals with themes of justice and caste. Addressing an invisible audience from her computer screen, Githa&rsquo;s tone grew urgent as she spoke of her literary values and her disagreement with the idea of writers as silver-tongued illusionists.<br /><br />This is no time &ldquo;to wax lyrical&rdquo;, she said, but &ldquo;to use words as what they are, weapons&rdquo;: the challenge is to discover solidarity, imagine multiplicity and connectedness. This is necessary, she added, if we are to resist the ascent of a &ldquo;homogeneous story&rdquo; which &ldquo;invariably leads to the exclusion of people [&hellip;] to censorship [&hellip;] to what the poet Seamus Heaney called &lsquo;the government of the tongue&rsquo;, and today that&rsquo;s where we are in our country&rdquo;. <br />Githa&rsquo;s words were all the more striking given her situation. It was four days since officials from the government&rsquo;s financial investigation agency, the Enforcement Directorate, had confined her and her partner, Prabir Purkayastha, to their house, blocking them from contact with the outside world, including lawyers. Her appearance at the literature festival, by special leave, was the first glimpse of her since the enforced disappearance. Halfway through the interview, she noted that it was exactly 100 hours since the Enforcement Directorate had taken over her life. They would remain for another 14 hours. <br /><br />While Githa and Prabir were effectively held hostage in their home, Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government had been planting stories against them. That very morning, the <em>Indian Express</em>, a leading national daily, had carried a report about some 30 crore rupees (&pound;3 million) in foreign &ldquo;remittances&rdquo; received by Prabir&rsquo;s media company, PPK NewsClick, payments the Enforcement Directorate was investigating. The report mentioned that the <em>Express</em> had not heard back from emails and texts sent to Prabir and <em>NewsClick</em>&rsquo;s editor, Pranjal Pandey. <br /><br />Had the newspaper tried asking around, it would have discovered that no one could reach Prabir. When the raids began on the morning of 9 February, from the <em>NewsClick</em> office to the homes of seven of its staff members &ndash; including Prabir and Pranjal &ndash; their access to phones and other electronic devices was suspended. As Githa addressed the Shoolini Literature Festival, the sleuthing carried on around her. The <em>Express </em>was not alone with its one-sided report. On 9 February, another national daily, the <em>Hindustan Times</em>, had published the government&rsquo;s claim that <em>NewsClick</em> was being probed for money laundering.</p> <h2>Tax raids, sedition and anti-terror laws</h2> <p>Raids like that on <em>NewsClick</em> have become routine in India: between 2011 and 2020, over 1,700 raids were carried out in connection with 1,569 investigations of tax evasion and money laundering. Only nine cases in this period ended with a conviction in court. The real punishment arrives with the long wait for a trial: bank accounts are frozen and questioning continues, as do raids and the harassment of employees. &ldquo;The process becomes the punishment,&rdquo; as Prabir wryly sums it up. <br /><br />In July this year, after a devastating second wave of Covid exposed the government&rsquo;s unpreparedness for a health crisis, both the television company Bharat Samachar and the Dainik Bhaskar Group, owner of one of the highest-circulating newspapers in Hindi, were raided &ndash; the latter at over 30 locations in five states. The two media houses had reported on the discrepancy between the government&rsquo;s low count of Covid fatalities and the real numbers logged by graveyards and cremation grounds. <br /><br />Tax raids have also been used against global organisations. In September 2020, Amnesty International was forced to halt operations in India after a succession of raids by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate. Amnesty had been sharply critical of human rights abuses in the wake of the Modi government&rsquo;s 2019 decision to rescind the constitutional recognition of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and again of the government&rsquo;s use of repressive new laws, whether in Kashmir or elsewhere in the country.<br /><br />If the Bureau and the Directorate don&rsquo;t sound Orwellian enough, there is also the National Investigation Agency, which handles cases of sedition and terrorism. Anti-terror laws and charges of sedition are a variation on the tax raid, freely used to silence critics. Sedition cases have shown a 28 per cent increase each year since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. At the start of its second term in 2019, the government also sharpened an already harsh law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The amended law permits the government to designate an individual as a terrorist before proving the charge in court. <br /><br />Bail is virtually impossible to obtain under the UAPA, and the government has the right to hold an accused person in custody for up to 180 days without presenting a charge sheet against them. The Bureau and the Agency handle cases under this law; both sedition and UAPA charges have been levelled at journalists on a regular basis. <br /><br />In October 2020, while covering the story of a caste atrocity &ndash; the gang rape and torture of a young Dalit woman that had led to her death &ndash; the journalist Siddique Kappan was arrested and charged with being a terrorist. More than a year later, he remains in prison awaiting trial. Once again, the rate of conviction is low, at less than 2 per cent of the 7,840 arrests made between 2015 and 2019. The rate of pendency (cases waiting to reach trial) stands at 83 per cent &ndash; the harrassment being the point.</p> <h2>Modi&rsquo;s &ldquo;unofficial Emergency&rdquo;</h2> <p>Opposition leaders and the commentariat often compare what is unfolding today to Indira Gandhi&rsquo;s suspension of democracy in 1975, terming it Modi&rsquo;s &ldquo;unofficial Emergency&rdquo;. Gandhi&rsquo;s 21-month-long dictatorship had entailed the suspension of fundamental rights, imprisonment of opposition leaders and pervasive press censorship. Modi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Emergency&rdquo; is more insidious. Rather than a straightforward authoritarian regime with a single author, it is built upon interlocking circles of collusion, an elite consensus that amplifies the government&rsquo;s message and supports its disruptive behaviour. India&rsquo;s mass media is no simple victim but part of this convergence of interests, and it is complicit in the gutting of democratic citizenship.<br /><br />At first glance, India&rsquo;s media landscape in print and broadcasting looks diverse: in 2018, there were over 118,239 publications, along with more than 380 news and current affairs channels on television. This appearance is deceptive: just a few media houses dominate the market. Their business models tend to rely on earnings from advertising, which makes editorial and journalistic freedom vulnerable to &ldquo;soft pressure&rdquo; from both government and corporations. <br /><br />Modi has set a record by becoming the first Indian prime minister to complete a full term in office without calling a single press conference. He did, however, spend twice as much on advertising in his first five years as the previous government did in ten. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the Economist Intelligence Unit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Democracy Index&rdquo; charts a steep decline in India&rsquo;s position. In 2014, it was ranked at 27 out of 167 countries; by 2020, it stood at 53, and was reclassified as a &ldquo;flawed democracy&rdquo;. International surveys echo this finding. This year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Democracy Report&rdquo;, published by the V-Dem Institute in Sweden, describes India&rsquo;s lapse from an &ldquo;electoral democracy&rdquo; in 2010 to an &ldquo;electoral autocracy&rdquo; in 2020. The grim proof of these assessments is the derisive manner in which they are reported on &ndash; or, frequently enough, not reported &ndash; in India&rsquo;s newsrooms.<br /><br />Palagummi Sainath, founder of the People&rsquo;s Archive of Rural India, points out that the Indian media systematically overlooks 70 per cent of the country&rsquo;s population. Coverage of rural issues makes up 0.67 per cent of front-page news in the national dailies, while crime and entertainment dominate the middle pages. Can it even be called &ldquo;mainstream media&rdquo;, he asks, if it studiously ignores the mainstream? And can its coverage of farmers&rsquo; protests be fair when the billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who gains from new laws that bring agriculture under corporate control, also happens to be India&rsquo;s biggest media owner?<br /><br />Despite lack of resources, small and independent digital platforms increasingly do the heavy lifting in terms of both news coverage and breaking stories. <em>NewsClick</em>, set up in a shabby one-room studio 12 years ago, saw viewership rise dramatically with its coverage of the farmers&rsquo; protest movement that began in 2020. Erupting with renewed vigour in early February this year, the farmers had the Modi government on the back foot when the Enforcement Directorate came calling on <em>NewsClick</em>.</p> <h2>Inequality in India&rsquo;s media houses</h2> <p>Inequality is entrenched in India&rsquo;s media houses. Oxfam India and the digital platform <em>Newslaundry </em>helped to expose this reality with their 2019 study &ldquo;Who Tells Our Stories Matters&rdquo;, which examined the representation of different groups in the media, including the indigenous Adivasis or Scheduled Tribes, and the Dalit communities (Scheduled Castes). Dalits make up 16.6 per cent of the national population, and continue to face widespread discrimination and violence, despite untouchability being outlawed. The study examined a selection of print, television and digital platforms in English and Hindi, finding that the Scheduled Tribes, who make up 8.6 per cent of the national population, were virtually absent from newsrooms. In prominent dailies such as the <em>Times of India</em> and the <em>Economic Times</em>, all the writers on caste issues turned out to be members of the upper castes.<br /><br />India&rsquo;s media is not an outlier here. Social exclusion is rampant in corporate boardrooms, the judiciary, bureaucracy, research and teaching positions in universities, and notably in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) &ndash; the mothership of Hindu nationalist ideology. A secretive and profoundly undemocratic organisation that reaches into every sphere of public life, the RSS has been led through the 96 years of its existence by six unelected men in succession, five of them from India&rsquo;s highest caste, the Brahmins (the remaining one was a Kshatriya, the second-highest caste). <br /><br />Away from traditional media institutions, however, excluded social groups have a vibrant presence in the digital and social media space. Among their demands is an all-India caste census (the last one was published in 1931). A new caste census, the journalist and public intellectual Dilip Mandal points out, would disclose each caste group&rsquo;s share in the national population, and in wealth, income, savings, credit, higher education and employment. This is precisely the kind of information suppressed by the elite consensus, whether between government and capital or that of upper-caste cohesion, for it would expose Hindutva to some painful truths. The last thing they want is for caste to be acknowledged as a dividing line within the Hindu social order, between entitlement and deprivation.<br /><br />Over the past three years, the prison population of underprivileged Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims has been joined by some of the country&rsquo;s most distinguished anti-caste scholars, lawyers, journalists and rights activists, all of them charged with terrorism under the UAPA. Self-assertion, whether by subordinate caste groups seeking their rightful share of resources, or by the anti-caste movement &ndash; which identifies Hinduism as the basis of caste &ndash; is a grave threat to the RSS&rsquo;s projection of a homogeneous and conservative Hindu nationhood.</p> <h2>The force of Hindutva</h2> <p>Promoting Islamophobia offers an escape route from the subject of caste and has proved useful for Modi in broadening Hindutva&rsquo;s base. &ldquo;Modi hai tau mumkin hai&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Modi makes it possible&rdquo; &ndash; was the insinuating slogan that returned the BJP government for a second term in 2019. The party&rsquo;s increased vote share and parliamentary majority were swiftly parlayed into a mandate to reshape the constitution. On 3 August that year, the amended UAPA overturned the presumption of innocence as a legal principle in terror-related cases. Two days later, the central government revoked Article 370 &ndash; which had granted the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir special recognition &ndash; and also trifurcated the state. Led by a raucous media, public opinion across the country cheered the dissolution of Kashmir&rsquo;s constitutional status. <br /><br />By the end of 2019, the central government had passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which obstructs Muslim immigrants from obtaining Indian citizenship. Amit Shah, the minister of home affairs, promised to launch a National Register of Citizens next. The poorly documented among India&rsquo;s Muslims, citizens included, saw themselves at imminent risk of being derecognised and interned. <br /><br />To supporters of Hindutva in the mass media, these were powerful moves. Primetime shows fanned the hatred, accusing Muslims of bizarre, wholly imaginary crimes, from waging &ldquo;love jihad&rdquo; (marrying Hindu women) to &ldquo;UPSC jihad&rdquo; (seeking jobs in the civil services), and even &ldquo;corona jihad&rdquo; (deliberately infecting Hindus). With this free pass for Islamophobia came a fresh contempt for facts and reasoning. This disdain was also extended to defenders of secular values: cued by BJP leaders, television studios denounced human rights activists as the &ldquo;bits-and-pieces gang&rdquo; of &ldquo;anti-national&rdquo; subversives, and as &ldquo;urban Naxals&rdquo; &ndash; secret agents fomenting a communist insurrection. When a group of writers returned their state awards in protest at the government&rsquo;s inaction against violence by lynch mobs attacking Dalits, Muslims and other minorities, they too were deemed &ldquo;anti-national&rdquo;. In these ways, the mass media has helped transform Modi&rsquo;s electoral victory into an epistemic coup. <br /><br />Githa&rsquo;s latest novel, <em>I Have Become the Tide</em>, shows an India where old forms of bigotry continue to defeat struggles for public reason, inclusion and dignity. However, the novel ends by marking a fresh start, as a great swell of people advances to confront a decaying culture. The ending is not a poetic consolation. Githa also put together a companion volume of non-fiction, <em>Battling for India</em>, that collates accounts of political resistance and ground-level organisation &ndash; by women, Dalits, Adivasis, writers, artists, religious, ethnic and sexual minorities &ndash; rallying against Hindutva and the neoliberal oligarchy. <br /><br />It may not be Birnam Wood and the troops advancing on Macbeth, not yet, but this force has the courage of its convictions. India&rsquo;s mass media, dwindling and demoralised, ignores this swell of resistance at its peril.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

(Flickr / Creative Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2021-12-20-at-17.39.40.jpg" height="753" alt="Screenshot-2021-12-20-at-17.39.40" width="1031" /></p> <p>As a young child, my brother and I would be packed into the family car each year at Christmas and driven to Rochester, in north Kent. There, my father had an annual engagement that, to be quite frank, embarrassed the hell out of us both. In the boot of the car was a small suitcase, and inside that a tailcoat, watchchain and other faded garments. We&rsquo;d arrive soon after sundown at Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place, the final home of Charles Dickens, and within the hour, dad would be up on stage in the school hall in Victorian costume, gripping a lectern, his body pitched forward as he read to the audience his own rendering of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. We, meanwhile, slid ever deeper into our seats. <br /><br />The voices of the many characters - gnarled and guttural for Scrooge, weak and whiny for Tiny Tim - I remember well. He executed them brilliantly. I also remember the odd gushing fan who&rsquo;d greet him like a rock star once the reading finished. What I wasn&rsquo;t of course aware of was the significance of the text itself. To me, it was just a Christmas story. The characters were richer than those of your average tale, and the story had a better developed moral arc than most. But it was just another Christmas story.<br /><br />Only later did the subversive quality of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, published in December 1843, come into view. Like several of Dickens&rsquo; other works, the book electrified much of Victorian Britain. But it did so for reasons that have been largely forgotten. The origins of <em>A Christmas Carol</em> had nothing to do with Christmas; it arose from an idea Dickens had earlier in 1843 to issue a political pamphlet, &ldquo;An Appeal to the People of England on behalf of the Poor Man&rsquo;s Child&rdquo;, to protest against the exploitation of children sent to work in mines and factories. He was also exercised by the condition of children attending London&rsquo;s Ragged Schools - free institutions for the poor that had been established by charities. Should children be given so much religious instruction in circumstances where the basic needs of food, drink and clothing seemed so much more urgent to address? &ldquo;To impress them, even with the idea of God, when their own condition is so desolate, becomes a monstrous task,&rdquo; he wrote in a published letter.<br /><br />Dickens shelved his first idea of the &ldquo;Appeal&rdquo;, and decided instead to reshape it into a short story and then to link that story with Christmas. The &ldquo;Poor Man&rsquo;s Child&rdquo; became Tiny Tim; Victorian society&rsquo;s spirit of callous laissez-faire was embodied in the grasping misanthrope Ebenezer Scrooge. It was an extraordinary success: 6000 copies sold in one day.</p> <h2>A secularist Victorian bible</h2> <p>&ldquo;Blessings on your kind heart,&rdquo; the Scottish literary critic Francis Jeffery wrote to Dickens soon after reading the short book. &ldquo;You may be sure you have done more good by this little publication, fostered more kindly feelings, and prompted more positive acts of beneficence, than can be traced to all the pulpits and confessionals in Christendom since 1842.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>A Christmas Carol</em> was greeted at the time, informally at least, as something of a secularist bible - or, as Paul Davis writes, &ldquo;the first gospel in the &lsquo;secular scripture&rsquo; of Victorian fiction&rdquo;. Dickens located the story in a smog-filled London at a time when cities, according to the American critic J. Hillis Miller, were &ldquo;the literal representation of the progressive humanization of the world&hellip; The way in which many men have experienced most directly what it means to live without God in the world.&rdquo;</p> <p>That distancing from Christian worship is reflected in the book. Despite occasional mentions of &ldquo;Our Founder&rdquo;, as well as the fact that Dickens was a practising Christian himself, <em>A Christmas Carol</em> steers clear of theological evangelising. The redemption story of Scrooge is a deeply humanistic one, and as such, the book appealed to both churchgoers and agnostics. It therefore stood out at a time when obsession with Christianity was pervasive in the literary world. By the time of Dickens&rsquo; death, half of all monthly periodicals and books were religiously oriented, despite the fact that religion was waning in British society more generally as a result of the rise of evolutionary science and the historical criticism of the Bible that would come a decade or two later.<br /><br />&ldquo;I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round &ndash; apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that &ndash; as a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time,&rdquo; Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew says early on, shunting the religious origin of Christmas into a passing parenthesis and instead emphasising the humanist value and meaning of the festivity. &ldquo;The only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts, freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.&rdquo; <br /><br />I didn&rsquo;t understand, as a child, that in this Christmas tale, Dickens had nailed together the structural edifice of a broad church, one that took ownership of charity away from the pious and made it a public moral duty. His belief was that responsibility for the unfortunate should be democratised - it was everyone&rsquo;s to share. It&rsquo;s a nice thing to remember my father using Christmas to bellow this same message from the lamplit stage.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
