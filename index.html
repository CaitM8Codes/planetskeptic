<p class="lead">I mentioned that I was messed up with some nasty lower back pain &#8212; I got in to the doctor this morning, and oh boy, I got some good drugs. I&#8217;m going to be doping myself with cyclobenzaprine three times a day for a while, so I don&#8217;t expect to be particularly perky for a while.</p>
<p>The pain has been pretty bad. On my personal scale I&#8217;d give it a 9 (10, the worst I&#8217;ve ever felt, was a ruptured eardrum). To put it in perspective, though, my wife went through labor and delivery three times, so it might have been a 3 or 4 on that scale.</p>
<p>Somehow I&#8217;ll have to wade through the lethargy and get the grading done. Maybe this will improve the student&#8217;s grades.</p>

<p class="lead">There it is: the black hole at the center of our galaxy, named Sagittarius A*. Hi there, big fella! You&#8217;re very pretty, please don&#8217;t swallow us up!</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/astronomers-reveal-first-image-black-131807134.html?fr=yhssrp_catchall">quite an achievement</a>, but weirdly, so many of the articles about it try to downplay it. OK, there are <em>bigger</em> black holes out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The M87 black hole is far more distant and massive than Sagittarius A*, situated about 54 million light-years from Earth with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our sun. In disclosing the photo of that black hole, the researchers said that their work showed that Albert Einstein, the famed theoretical physicist, had correctly predicted that the shape of the shadow would be almost a perfect circle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we know. M87 is impressive, but the mass of <em>four million suns</em>, like Sagittarius A* possesses, is nothing to sneeze at. Also extraordinary and impressive.</p>
<p>The worst comes from an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2022/05/11/black-hole-milky-way/">astronomer talking to the Washington Post</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Feryal Ozel, a University of Arizona astronomer, described the achievement as &#8220;the first direct image of the gentle giant in the center of our galaxy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>WTF? Our black hole is not gentle at all &#8212; it&#8217;s a snarling, spitting, shrieking maelstrom of lethal radiation and deadly cosmic forces. I will not tolerate this diminution of our all-engulfing pit of chaotic darkness.</p>

<p class="lead">It&#8217;s good to have an outsider take a look at us and give some insight. Here&#8217;s an excellent example: a Slovakian wondering what&#8217;s up with American suburbs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked those same questions myself. When I lived in Pennsylvania, we first got an apartment in a shiny glossy hellhole, in a town called King of Prussia. It was the most dead, soulless place I&#8217;ve ever been to. The apartments were clean and good, but imbedded in loops of freeways, and the sole attraction was a mega-mall. We got out of there as soon as we could.</p>
<p>The next stop was a house in a suburban development near Jenkintown. It met one of the criteria mentioned by the Slovakian: there was bus service. I made that a requirement by taking mass transit to get to any place we were seriously considering. But the rest of that list fit it perfectly. The only things in that development were residential housing. If you wanted to go anywhere, you had to have a car. On weekends, there were no coffeeshops to walk to, no movie theaters, nothing. You stayed home and mowed your lawn. I kind of hated it.</p>
<p>We had moved to Pennsylvania from Salt Lake City, and that was an unpleasant change. Salt Lake City is a weird place, but I&#8217;ll give it this: there were lots of parks in walking distance from anywhere you might live. There was a bagel place a block away from my apartment, and three movie theaters within a few blocks, one of them a funky art house kind of place. We were surrounded by restaurants, too, although with three little kids we didn&#8217;t get to partake very often.</p>
<p>There are enriching places for humans to live, and then there are festering, ingrown suburbs that were built by short-sighted developers and that are entirely dependent on cars for survival. For some reason, probably capitalist greed, many Americans are compelled to live in the latter, for lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Oh, also, racism.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the city of Minneapolis took a bold step and <a href="https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html">changed zoning laws</a>. Such a simple thing, with deep consequences!</p>
<blockquote><p>Minneapolis will become the first major U.S. city to end single-family home zoning, a policy that has done as much as any to entrench segregation, high housing costs, and sprawl as the American urban paradigm over the past century.</p>
<p>On Friday, the City Council passed Minneapolis 2040, a comprehensive plan to permit three-family homes in the city’s residential neighborhoods, abolish parking minimums for all new construction, and allow high-density buildings along transit corridors.</p>
<p>“Large swaths of our city are exclusively zoned for single-family homes, so unless you have the ability to build a very large home on a very large lot, you can’t live in the neighborhood,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told me this week. Single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today. Abolishing restrictive zoning, the mayor said, was part of a general consensus that the city ought to begin to mend the damage wrought in pursuit of segregation. Human diversity—which nearly everyone in this staunchly liberal city would say is a good thing—only goes as far as the housing stock.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s probably too soon to tell for sure, and there&#8217;s more to this problem than just zoning, but there are hints that we might be getting some incremental, evolutionary change. Here&#8217;s an <a href="https://streets.mn/2022/05/06/minneapolis-rents-drop/">article by a landlord</a> &lt;makes the sign of the cross, mutters a prayer of protection&gt; that suggests there has been a subtle shift. First, she points out the racial disparities &#8212; maybe that ought to be one of the first answers to give that Slovakian. Race hatred poisons everything in this country.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve worked on housing affordability since 1997. That whole time, the Twin Cities has been losing ground, with homes becoming steadily less affordable. Rents have been rising — sometimes very rapidly. The portion of people paying more than 30 percent or even 50 percent of their income in rent (the definition of “housing cost burden”) is stubbornly high, especially for Black households. While we increase public funding for Affordable Housing — the subsidized kind — the number of unsheltered people grows.<br />
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/HousingCostBurden-MplsFedDashboard-500x365.png"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/HousingCostBurden-MplsFedDashboard-500x365-500x365.png" alt="" width="500" height="365" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-66522" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/HousingCostBurden-MplsFedDashboard-500x365.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/HousingCostBurden-MplsFedDashboard-500x365-150x110.png 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/HousingCostBurden-MplsFedDashboard-500x365-300x219.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>But then she looks at rents. It&#8217;s messy, and complicated by the fact that we&#8217;re in a pandemic, but things are looking slightly better.</p>
<blockquote><p>This spring, I pulled all the median advertised rent information from the Minneapolis Rental Housing Brief into a spreadsheet. I didn’t adjust it for inflation. I used three-month rolling averages to smooth out the monthly noise. Check out these results.</p>
<p>Line graph showing 1, 2, and 3br rent trends in Minneapolis 2018 through 2022<br />

Data: HousingLink Minneapolis Rental Housing Brief, chart by author<br />
The actual advertised median rents for one- and two-bedroom apartments are lower — in actual dollars — in 2022 than they were in late 2018. Three-bedroom rents went up 2 percent over the four years, while inflation went up 11 percent over the same time. These shifts started more than a year before the pandemic. “Post” pandemic increases look big due to the atypical and extremely low rents during summer 2020. But trends show that Minneapolis rents have simply returned to pre-pandemic levels. </p></blockquote>
<p>Rents are a rather narrow parameter to scrutinize livability in a city, but it&#8217;s something, at least.</p>
<p>As for my situation now: I&#8217;m in a small town that would find it difficult to lock down a large chunk of land and reserve it for single family housing, although they&#8217;d like to try, I&#8217;m sure. There are some nascent suburb-like areas near town where the local construction company has put up rows and rows of houses. We looked at those when we were on the market, and crossed them all off our list when we noticed their common feature: they all had gigantic garages, another affliction of American housing. We don&#8217;t own three gargantuan trucks, which would have easily fit into those garages, so we didn&#8217;t see the point. Now we live in a quirky older home with all the commercial amenities within a half-mile walk, and a university next door, which is a much nicer way to live. We&#8217;ve gone for weeks without driving a car!</p>
<p>I guess the bottom line explanation I&#8217;d give the Slovakian would be two words: cars and racism.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Steven Pinker giving a lecture for Humanists UK (Wikimedia Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Steven_Pinker.jpg" height="835" alt="Steven Pinker" width="1252" /></p> <p class="p1">Steven Pinker&rsquo;s <em><span class="s1">Rationality</span></em> is a tour de force training manual on how to think. Lessons in logical deduction, in avoiding cognitive biases and probability blunders, and in how to recognise fallacies all provide stimulus for vital mental spring-cleaning. Not merely instructive, <span class="s1"><em>Rationality</em> </span>is also an affirmation of many of the most fundamental humanist commitments: the simple beauty of the recursive nature of reason, the indispensability of rationality to deliberative democracy, the celebration of science, ethics and law as the greatest achievements of human rationality.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>But <em><span class="s1">Rationality</span> </em>aspires to do more than just explain, define and describe its eponymous concept. Its full subtitle asks not just &ldquo;What [rationality] is&rdquo;, but &ldquo;Why it seems scarce, Why it matters&rdquo;. And it isn&rsquo;t a utopian tract, arguing for human beings as perfect rational actors who go astray only when manipulated or misled. In many forms, Pinker says, rationality is counterintuitive &ndash; we often need to engineer it. So, bookending the chapters that deal with the many aspects of the nature of rationality is Pinker&rsquo;s most urgent call: to understand that rationality does matter, that it needs defending, and that we must advance it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The book&rsquo;s focus is a natural extension of the Canadian-American&rsquo;s inquiries to date. As a public intellectual and committed member of the humanist movement &ndash; as well as a cognitive psychologist and psycholinguist &ndash; Pinker&rsquo;s work, especially his 2011 book <em><span class="s1">The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</span></em> and its sequel, <span class="s1"><em>Enlightenment Now</em> </span>(2018), has argued consistently and forcefully for the importance of science, reason and humanism to the advancement of our species. As Chief Executive of Humanists UK, I was especially keen to discuss the book with Pinker &ndash; particularly the idea, as he summarised it to me, that &ldquo;good things only happen as a result of human ingenuity and reason deployed toward humanistic goals&rdquo;. I enthusiastically agree. But it&rsquo;s easy to entice someone like me to embrace and celebrate the case for rationality. What about those who are not yet convinced, who may be the very people fighting for social change?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>&ldquo;One of the reasons that I&rsquo;m active in the humanist movement,&rdquo; he tells me, &ldquo;is I think we can provide reasons why some goals are better than others by pointing out how they are consistent with other values that virtually everyone claims to believe.&rdquo; Yet for Pinker&rsquo;s aim of advancing rationality to be meaningfully fulfilled, it does seem to me that we must do more than rationally point out the inconsistencies in the thinking of others.</p> <h2 class="p4">Making use of myth?</h2> <p class="p5">Towards the end of <em><span class="s1">Rationality</span></em>, Pinker classifies beliefs into two types. The first belong in our &ldquo;reality&rdquo; mindset. We arrive at and sustain these beliefs by reasoning about facts in our direct experience: water will boil at 100 degrees; cooking food will make it edible and nourishing. As these examples imply, beliefs of the reality type are also those that are essential to our everyday lives.<br /><br />Beliefs of the second type &ndash; those in our &ldquo;mythology&rdquo; mindset &ndash; operate in a different zone. They relate to the worlds beyond our direct experience: the long ago, the far away, the metaphysical. The functions of these beliefs are different from the beliefs in our reality mindset, and broader. They provide entertainment, moral lessons, a sense of meaning, social solidarity and more. Conspiracy theories, superstitions, comforting falsehoods, religions and tribalisms all live in our mythology mindset.<br /><br />As inheritors of the enlightenment tradition, committed to its dynamic continuation, we are duty-bound &ndash; so <em><span class="s1">Rationality</span></em> argues &ndash; to make sure that as many of our beliefs as possible fall into the &ldquo;reality&rdquo; mindset. But I realised, reflecting on the book, that my own commitment to rationality has a considerable amount of the mythological about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>I remember the first time I read a legal judgement. I can recall the admirable clarity with which the judge assessed the evidence presented to her. The arguments lawyers had made were considered, and &ndash; step by logical step &ndash; a judicious conclusion was reached. I found the experience of reading her words enormously satisfying. I didn&rsquo;t just regard the rationality of her process as an effective way of getting to the truth. I felt a sort of pleasure as the judgement unfolded and took shape. At the end, I felt an aesthetic appreciation at something having been done properly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>It reminded me of my favourite work of theatre, Aeschylus&rsquo; <em><span class="s1">Oresteia</span></em>. Its final scene is an enactment of the first ever court, presided over by the goddess Athena, where adversarial truth-seeking justice replaces blood guilt and vengeance. Written two and a half millennia ago, it depicted the mythical world of centuries before that, providing an inspiring origin story for rational adjudication.</p> <p class="p5">Thinking about that scene and the <em><span class="s1">Oresteia</span></em> brings to mind what Einstein said about the Greeks, that they were the first to &ldquo;overcome man&rsquo;s insecurity before himself and before nature&rdquo; and the first who &ldquo;wrought a system of thought whose conclusions no one could escape&rdquo; &ndash; a beautiful way of describing both the art of reasoning and its profound consequences. What the broadcaster and humanist Jacob Bronowksi called this Greek &ldquo;assertion of confidence&rdquo; evokes the 20th-century scientific confidence that people like Bronowski and Einstein represent. I see the centuries-long chain of men and women who have carved out a space for truth and justice in an indifferent universe &ndash; their effort, their commitment, their inspiring struggle. In this timeless community, as the humanist philosopher Harold Blackham put it, &ldquo;Nothing is exempt from human question. There is no immemorial tradition, no revelation, no authority, no privileged knowledge . . . which is beyond question because [it is] beyond experience and which can be used as a standard by which to interpret experience. There is only experience to be interpreted in the light of further experience, the sole source of all standards of reason and value, forever open to question.&rdquo; Rationality is the golden thread that runs through so much that makes the human story vital and vivid in my mind&rsquo;s eye.<br /><br /><span class="s2">A</span>ll this may lack the sensuousness of Proust&rsquo;s madeleine, but it&rsquo;s plain that my own commitment to rationality at least in part resides in the category of mythological belief, a weaving together of all these narratives and more. This mythology even has its own magic. The three little words &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be reasonable&rdquo; always have the power to recall me to calmness. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I think, &ldquo;we should be reasonable. I was being unreasonable and overheated. I should stop that.&rdquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t want to let Athena down.</p> <p class="p5">This is very personal, but it is not merely by way of autobiography. I am not the only one whose most powerful motivations come from my &ldquo;mythological&rdquo; beliefs, nor the only person who is more likely to be rational if the case for doing so can be made more vivid and warm. So, to return to my question arising from Pinker&rsquo;s new book: if we do need to find ways to promote rationality &ndash; and it won&rsquo;t do to just tell people it is fact-based and true &ndash; should we make use of the mythology mindset, and not just the principles exhorted in <em><span class="s1">Rationality</span></em>? I put this to Pinker.<br /><br />&ldquo;Do we want to have humanist preachers rolling back their eyes and pumping copies of Spinoza&rsquo;s <span class="s1">Ethics</span> on the pulpit?&rdquo; he responds. &ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo; But, he says, &ldquo;we do need something. We are human. We are motivated by ideals, images, heroes. I think that is reasonable to the extent that we know how to bottle them so that they don&rsquo;t infect our understanding of reality. If it&rsquo;s a way to engage our emotions toward ends that we can justify on humanist grounds, then it&rsquo;s probably wise, it&rsquo;s probably a challenge that we ought to step up to.&rdquo;<br /><br />I expressed the hope that this could be achieved through &ldquo;mythologies&rdquo;, but Pinker is much more comfortable with the idea that rhetoric will provide motivation: &ldquo;Maybe we have to study the cases of successful political leadership and rhetoric that managed to engage people&rsquo;s emotions toward goals that we all can best justify.&rdquo; He singles out Martin Luther King, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barack Obama. &ldquo;It is an art that I think probably requires a rare combination of talents &ndash; intellectual and interpersonal and emotional. I do what I&rsquo;m capable of doing, which is making the case. It ain&rsquo;t Martin Luther King. But, you know, maybe it would inspire some future version of Martin Luther King!&rdquo;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>In fact, the prose of <em><span class="s1">Rationality</span></em> frequently inspires, and there are many passages that would qualify as required reading on any curriculum of &ldquo;rationalist myth-making&rdquo;, if such a thing were thought desirable after all. But I come to my next question, on advancing the case for rationality. In his book, Pinker argues that being rational has an image problem and that this is one cause of the current crisis of reason. To be rational is not seen as &ldquo;cool&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s an unattractive thing to aspire to. This may be true, but it&rsquo;s not my biggest concern. Perhaps I am defeatist, but I have taken it as read that many people are going to behave irrationally a lot of the time and that rationality will never be the predominant fashion. What worries me most today is the possibility that the people most inspired by justice, equality and human dignity may be averse to the idea of rationality.</p> <h2 class="p4">Rationalism and social change</h2> <p class="p5">Pinker takes aim in <em><span class="s1">Rationality</span></em> at what he sees as an unhelpful trend: that young people on university campuses are pursuing social justice while adhering to &ldquo;fashionable academic movements&rdquo; that &ldquo;hold that reason, truth and objectivity are social constructions that justify the privilege of dominant groups&rdquo;. Because the students aligned with these movements also, he says, believe that &ldquo;western philosophy and science are parochial, old-fashioned, and naive to the diverse ways of knowing found across periods and cultures&rdquo;, Pinker places them outside of the rational.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>I certainly don&rsquo;t think rationality is a parochial cultural product. But I do see that it can be preached in aid of the privilege of dominant groups, especially economically dominant ones, and I understand why the people Pinker is talking about feel that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The plea of &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be reasonable&rdquo; from friend to friend might annoy you in the instant, but it does no harm. Between colleagues who share a certain discipline it may be vital, recalling us both to a shared standard. But a plea to be reasonable in the context of the struggle for equality or justice has less palatable associations. I, the rational actor, am calling on you to bring yourself into line. The implication is that you are too emotional, perhaps overly demanding. It&rsquo;s obvious why the suspicion arises that rationality works against the interests of the less powerful and the vulnerable. This is worrying, especially if we have a particular obligation to persuade those committed to humanistic goals that human reason is the way to realise their hopes. So I ask how we can make rationality appealing to those who promote social justice, democracy and human rights.<br /><br />Pinker responds that it is rational arguments, not angry protestors, that have historically triggered social change, disputing the idea advanced by his campus radicals that progress is &ldquo;a story of struggle, with the downtrodden rising up and overcoming their oppressors&rdquo;. His general theory of social progress is that &ldquo;the first domino [is] a reasoned argument&rdquo;. A philosopher wrote a text or manifesto and &ldquo;eventually the conclusion was absorbed into the conventional wisdom and common decency of a society, erasing the tracks of the argument that brought it there&rdquo;.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>We agree, however, that rationality is not the only tool required to achieve moral progress and that, as the book clearly states, there is no iron law of history. Human societies are not laboratories and no firm conclusions can be drawn about what &ldquo;works&rdquo;. Nonetheless, Pinker strongly prefers the rational argument theory. I am not so sure. Even the Enlightenment-soaked founding fathers of the US didn&rsquo;t reason George III out of his malfeasance. They overthrew him.<br /><br />On the other hand, Pinker does persuade me that we have a strong argument for convincing progressives of the importance of rationality to achieving social change. &ldquo;The rights of the downtrodden, the oppressed and the less privileged ought to be fostered and I for one am not willing to say that&rsquo;s an irrational argument, quite the contrary,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ultimately a rational one, stemming from the principle of the equality of all humans. This itself is an inherently rational proposition, because it simply hinges on the fact that the pronouns &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;You&rsquo; have no logical status. The idea &lsquo;Whatever I claim for myself, I have to grant to you equally&rsquo; is just built into rational discourse.&rdquo;<br /><br />In <em><span class="s1">Rationality</span></em>, Pinker says much of the need to re-engineer our world for rationality, from working to valorise it in popular culture to building it further into our school curricula. It&rsquo;s a powerful manifesto: we do need to build and maintain resilient rationality-based institutions in every area of our common life. But I am left thinking that the main path out of our present difficulties may be the one that he expresses later &ndash; and quite beautifully &ndash; in our conversation. Putting rationality at the very heart of the case we make for our love and care for each other is what can in turn give rationality itself back its heart.<br /><br /><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p class="lead">I mean, how could I not read a story with the title, <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/america-first-nick-fuentes/">White nationalist &#8216;America First&#8217; group plunges into chaos after high-ranking official gets a girlfriend</a>? It&#8217;s the most pungent kind of clickbait. It seems Nick Fuentes, that unbelievable cartoon of a man, is in disarray over the fact that one of his employees has done something fairly normal.</p>
<blockquote><p>The America First movement has plunged into turmoil after its treasurer started a romantic relationship and moved out of the group leader&#8217;s basement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Somehow, I could have guessed someone was going to be living in someone else&#8217;s basement somewhere in the story.</p>
<blockquote><p>White nationalist Nick Fuentes, the right-wing group&#8217;s leader and associate of Reps. Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene, urges his followers to abstain from sex, and he describes himself as an incel, or involuntarily celibate.</p>
<p>This led the nonprofit group&#8217;s treasurer Jaden McNeil to resign and call America First a cult, reported The Daily Beast&#8217;s &#8220;Fever Dreams&#8221; podcast.</p>
<p>“[Members act so] racist and ridiculous in public that it ruins people’s lives,” said co-host Kelly Weill on the podcast. “You can’t go and get a normal job after that, so they turn further and further into this movement, which really does function almost like a cult.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that Gosar and Greene, who have a modicum of power and influence, are entangled with Nick Fuentes, is revealing about the sad state of American politics. How can anyone in the halls of power take this guy seriously?</p>
<p>That last paragraph, though, explains a lot. America First is openly and loudly racist, and its members have openly slapped that stigma on their records. This is how cults start: throw out one absurdity for your followers to accept, watch as the majority walk away, but the ones who stay…give &#8217;em another absurdity. Then another. And another. You&#8217;ve got the few so deeply hooked that you can get them to do whatever you want. Tell your followers that you translated the holy book by staring at magic rocks in a hat, and if they swallow that, you can load &#8217;em up into a wagon train and go found a city in the middle of nowhere. Fuentes is such a patently hateful fool that his followers <em>have</em> to be committed to stick by him, not by virtue of the quality of his arguments, but because they&#8217;re so stupid that admitting that leads to an exposure of their gullibility.</p>
<p>By the way, this also explains how Michelle Malkin has ended up associated with this group. She&#8217;s been making horrible choices for many years &#8212; justifying the internment of Asian Americans in WWII just one of them &#8212; so of course she has sorted herself to the bottom of the dumpster.</p>

Synthetic video content &ndash; that is, video which is wholly or partly generated by artificial intelligence &ndash; has been in widespread use since at least 2017. Until now, however, it has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/7/20902215/deepfakes-usage-youtube-2019-deeptrace-research-report">largely been used</a> for non-consensual pornography, targeting women by using their likeness without their consent.</p> <p class="p2">This year, this developing technology <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60780142">has been weaponised</a> in the Russia-Ukraine war. In March, a deepfake video was released, apparently showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asking Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons. It was unsuccessful. After the TV channel Ukraine 24 was hacked so that its website displayed the video, Zelensky was alerted and posted a Facebook video explaining that it was a fake. Twitter and YouTube were quick to announce that they were tracking and removing the video where it was being shared, as it breached their rules on deceptive synthetic media.</p> <p class="p2">However, as a <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/09/05/campaigns-must-prepare-for-deepfakes-this-is-what-their-plan-should-look-like-pub-79792">playbook for defeating deepfakes </a>that the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace released in 2019 put it, while digital fakery can, for now, be detected pretty easily, &ldquo;People have a visceral reaction to video and audio. They believe what their eyes and ears are telling them &ndash; even if all signs suggest that the video and audio content is fake.&rdquo; Since that report, artificial intelligence has advanced, substantially increasing the realism of deepfakes and cutting the resources required to create them.</p> <p class="p2">How do we face this coming tide of disinformation? New technology is part of the picture. In late 2020, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) <a href="https://governmentciomedia.com/darpa-launches-new-programs-detect-falsified-media#:~:text=The%20Defense%20Advanced%20Research%20Projects,falsified%20media%2C%20such%20as%20deepfakes.">launched a Media Forensics programme</a> to develop new prototypes to identify and combat falsified media. They use detection algorithms, which analyse media content to determine if manipulation has occurred; and fusion algorithms, which combine information across multiple detectors to create an &ldquo;integrity score&rdquo; for each media asset.</p> <p class="p2">But as Nina Schick, author of <em>Deepfakes: The Coming Infocalypse</em>, <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepfakes-porn-politics">pointed out recently</a> in <em>Wired</em> magazine, &ldquo;our crisis of information will not be for technology to solve alone. Any technological solutions will be useless unless we humans are able to adapt to this new environment where fake media is commonplace.&rdquo; This will require &ldquo;inoculation&rdquo; through digital-literacy and awareness training, along with concerted action from government, military and civil groups.</p> <p class="p2">We need to prepare now for this rising threat to our information eco-system. At the moment, it is relatively easy to spot deepfake videos. As the recent video of Zelensky shows, such fakes can be countered with a prompt response. But as technology advances, it is only a matter of time before we will need additional tools and strategies in order to distinguish a deepfake from the real thing.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a3-a7 a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a-all a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

According to the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies, <a href="https://crss.pk/blasphemy-cases-in-pakistan-1947-2021/">at least 89 citizens </a>have been murdered in killings related to blasphemy cases since Pakistan was established in 1947. There were five last year alone.</p> <p class="p2">Even against this grim backdrop, the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dga85/woman-teacher-killed-blasphemy-dream-pakistan">recent murder of Safoora Bibi,</a> a teacher at an all-girls religious school in Pakistan, is striking for its particularly horrific nature and the rarity of the killers being women: a female colleague and two of the victim&rsquo;s former students have been accused. The girls told police that a relative dreamed that Bibi had committed blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad. Police are investigating whether the killing was in fact related to a personal feud. This is often at the root of blasphemy allegations in Pakistan, since the potential punishment is so high and the burden of proof so low (accusers can even refuse to repeat the alleged blasphemy for fear of blaspheming themselves).</p> <p class="p2">Last December, Priyantha Kumara, a Sri Lankan general manager of a garment factory in Sialkot, a city in Pakistan&rsquo;s Punjab region, was <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/3/sri-lankan-factory-manager-lynched-and-set-on-fire-in-pakistan">bludgeoned to death by a mob</a> after reportedly removing posters that had sections from the Koran written on them. Many people, including the president of the local chamber of commerce, maintain that Kumara was in fact targeted by his factory&rsquo;s workers over a personal grudge.</p> <p class="p2">According to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, about <a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2019%20Pakistan%20Blasphemy.pdf">80 people in Pakistan</a> are in prison for blasphemy, with at least half facing a life sentence or death. There have been no executions since the moratorium on the death penalty 14 years ago. However, there is some evidence that the death penalty emboldens ordinary citizens to carry out vigilante killings in Pakistan. Some of the goriest mob lynchings occurred after the moratorium was introduced. Perpetrators of these vigilante killings are rarely brought to justice.</p> <p class="p2">Whatever the motive of the women who killed Safoora Bibi, attacks based on blasphemy accusations look set to continue. With Pakistan mired in a broader political crisis after Imran Khan was ousted, a change to the law is not on the agenda: in the last 15 years, politicians who proposed reform have been threatened and even killed. As long as the country has some of the strictest blasphemy laws in the the world, we will continue to see innocent people murdered by their fellow citizens.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a3-a7 a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a-all a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p2"><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

On 27 April, the Nationality and Borders Act finally passed through parliament, despite evidence that it risks criminalising asylum seekers and denying their right to reunion with their families already in the country. Meanwhile, the Homes for Ukraine scheme &ndash; through which individuals, charities and business can sponsor refugees fleeing the Russia-Ukraine war &ndash; has grabbed headlines while falling behind on targets, as Ukrainians struggle to actually obtain the visas required, with many of the spare rooms offered remaining empty.</p> <p class="p2">The immigration bill had been stuck in parliament since last July, and to force it through the government dropped one of the more controversial aspects: the so-called &ldquo;push-back&rdquo; policy that would allow the UK to stop asylum seekers in the Channel and send their dinghies back to France. However, the new legislation still penalises refugees entitled to asylum in the UK for having reached the country via &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; means. The government has repeatedly claimed that the aim is to crack down on people-smuggling gangs and to prevent deaths at sea. However, they were<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/fury-as-patels-borders-bill-found-misleading-on-safe-routes-for-migrants"> forced to admit </a>in April that the bill contained no provision for safe and legal routes for asylum seekers into Britain. Therefore this argument appears to be disingenuous.</p> <p class="p2">Thus far, <a href="https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/bond-and-over-150-organisations-lobby-government-to-scrap-cruel-rwanda-asylum-plan.html">160 charities and campaign groups</a> have branded the bill &ldquo;shamefully cruel&rdquo;. The UNHCR, meanwhile, has raised concerns that the law will undermine the Refugee Convention, along with Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;longstanding global cooperation on refugee issues&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p2">Particular concerns have been raised over the new legislation allowing for the removal of refugees to other countries. Some critics have questioned the feasibility of the &pound;120 million deal with Rwanda for offshore housing of asylum seekers, given the legal challenges such a scheme is likely to face. But the possibility of such a development has prompted outrage. The move has been seen as further evidence of Britain seeking to abandon its international obligations, and to shirk its ethical responsibility to provide safe refuge to people fleeing war and persecution.</p> <p class="p2">Meanwhile, a whistleblower working for the Homes for Ukraine scheme <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/homes-for-ukraine-whistleblower-says-uk-refugee-scheme-is-designed-to-fail">has claimed</a> that the policy was &ldquo;designed to fail&rdquo;, in order to limit the numbers of Ukrainians entering the country. Announced in the Commons as advancing Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;long and proud history&rdquo; of supporting the most vulnerable &ldquo;in their darkest hours&rdquo;, the scheme was criticised from the start for requiring asylum seekers toapply for a visa. This bureaucratic process &ndash; in which people are sometimes expected to travel hundreds of miles to passport or visa offices &ndash; drastically limits and slows a process intended to aid victims of war who may be in immediate danger.</p> <p class="p2">The Refugee Council has <a href="https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/homes-for-ukraine-scheme-refugee-council-response/">expressed concern </a>about the prospect of housing traumatised people with individuals who had not been through any robust checks or training, while it&rsquo;s still unclear what will happen to refugees after the six-month stint with sponsors comes to an end. This latest whistleblower leak, claiming that the system was designed to &ldquo;keep the numbers down&rdquo;, seems to confirm suspicions that limitations aren&rsquo;t a bug, but rather a feature.</p> <p class="p2">Taken in the round, the least cynical of observers might conclude that the UK government&rsquo;s priority is simply to keep refugee numbers low. Thus far, appeals to moral and international commitments have been ignored, as has the opinion of the British public, whose views in a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/migrants-asylum-rwanda-boris-johnson-b2058114.html">recent YouGov poll</a> showed the majority opposed the Rwanda deal, with 27 per cent &ldquo;strongly opposed&rdquo;. So much for Britain&rsquo;s much-trumpeted &ldquo;long and proud history&rdquo; of providing refuge for the vulnerable &ndash; at least where the current government is concerned.</p> <p class="p2"><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist summer 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-07-at-15.01.46.jpg" height="758" alt="What strange paradise" width="942" /></p> <p class="p1">Along the far end of the port of Lesbos, I watch two Afghan boys push battered mountain bikes against a wind that drives in from the water, past a military vessel emblazoned with an EU flag. Farther out at sea, the forms of violence &ndash; from the elements or at the hands of those commanding such vessels &ndash; being delivered to others like these boys are difficult to think about. Yet it is into just such a world that Omar El Akkad draws us. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Set on an unnamed Aegean island, as well as in Egypt and on the fickle waters in between, <em><span class="s1">What Strange Paradise</span></em> traces the journey of a young Syrian boy across the Mediterranean to Europe. Nine-year-old Amir inadvertently finds himself aboard a smuggler&rsquo;s rickety vessel in Alexandria whose wreckage is ultimately washed up on a European beach. The novel is structured into interlacing chapters of before and after, which recount Amir&rsquo;s hazardous passage and the similarly perilous adventure following his arrival.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Central to the latter is the novel&rsquo;s other key protagonist, the teenage Vanna: a second-generation northern European migrant whose family owns a failed guesthouse on the tourist-laden island. It is Vanna who first encounters Amir after his apparent brush with death. She becomes his accomplice in a mission to deliver him from the hands of the local police and asylum system to the mainland.</p> <p class="p1">It is a Manichean world of azure sunlit beaches and blackened nights on a tormenting sea, where those seeking safety are ruthlessly exploited by smugglers and then rounded up at gunpoint by the authorities on arrival. Yet it is illuminated by individual acts of solidarity and heroism. El Akkad&rsquo;s portrait of contemporary asylum-seeking &ndash; its violence, mercilessness and tedium, relieved by flashes of altruism &ndash; gives the uninitiated vivid insight into the realities of what is commonly called the EU&rsquo;s &ldquo;migrant crisis&rdquo;.<br /><br />Indeed, the opening passage in which Amir&rsquo;s small body lies prostrate in the sand is an obvious reanimation of the image of the Kurdish toddler Alan Kurdi, whose tiny corpse unleashed a tide of global attention when it appeared in 2015. Yet El Akkad simultaneously plays with the boundaries of social realism, stretching them such that the story takes on a fable-like hue. It is unsurprising then that the author expresses a love of alchemy in writing, describing the book as a repurposing of the tale of Peter Pan: Vanna the young Wendy on the threshold of adulthood and escapism, and Captain Hook manifest in the novel&rsquo;s steely Colonel Kethros, who, with his amputated leg, doggedly pursues the two children across the island.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /></span><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br /></span>The novel is thus also distinctly cinematic, populated by archetypes (the villainous smuggler, the conflicted young officer, the maternal Muslim woman) and driven by fast-paced action and pithy dialogue. At times, this dynamic can feel on the verge of trite. Kethros suffers from PTSD from military service in the Balkans, but this background of trauma is underdeveloped, while the fable-like simplicity in parts of the novel sits at odds with the nuances of its realism elsewhere, such as Vanna&rsquo;s complex relationship with her distant mother. Nonetheless, the novel is interwoven with truths of such universal resonance, told with poignancy, that the reader often pauses between lines. Most resonant is El Akkad&rsquo;s characterisation of the human relationship to place and to those perceived as outsiders. Vanna&rsquo;s body, for example &ndash; with its white skin, blue eyes and blond hair &ndash; speaks to Amir of &ldquo;luxury, betterment, possibility&rdquo;. The novel explores how her Aryan body is dealt with differently to the dark-skinned migrants, many of them destined for the sea floor, among the &ldquo;million interlocking bodies who&rsquo;d braved this passage before&hellip; and come to rest at the bottom, sick with the secrets of their own unallowed mourning.&rdquo;<br /><br />The novel holds a mirror to the absurdity and cruelty of the EU migration system, while framing events in Europe against the vaster scale of disaster around the globe. As such, it is a meditation on human behaviour when pressed to its extremes: a study of universal relevance in which El Akkad weaves his tales while playing many roles, as Scheherazade does in <em><span class="s1">One Thousand and One Nights</span></em>: raconteur, provocateur &ndash; and, ultimately, jurist.</p> <p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></span></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook&#8217;s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>
