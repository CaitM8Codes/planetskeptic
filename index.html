            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Mary caught a centipede in the house, and I was going to take a quick picture of it…but it was way too active. So I had the bright idea of bringing it to the lab, and just carry it outside as I walked in. I had it in a large plastic container that I figured would provide some thermal insulation.</p>
<p>It was not enough. </p>
<p>Before I reached the end of the driveway, it was immobile &#8212; that was less than a minute. It took another 3 or 4 minutes to get to work, and it looked dead and frozen. I took a picture anyway. This is a sad, corpselike centipede. Whoops. I was pretty sure I&#8217;d killed it with surprising speed. I guess -20°C isn&#8217;t healthy for small invertebrates.</p>
<p><span id="more-65746"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/centipede.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/centipede-500x334.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="334" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65747" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/centipede-500x334.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/centipede-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/centipede-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/centipede-768x513.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>And then it started twitching as it warmed up. Now it&#8217;s fully recovered. I guess centipedes are harder to kill than I thought.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said Russian troops were fighting to break into the wider Kyiv region and crossed the regional border, where Ukrainian forces were battling to repel them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Putin&#8217;s excuse is that they&#8217;re carrying out a program of &#8220;demilitarization and denazification&#8221;. Riiight. This is nothing but imperial conquest. People are dying. Cities are being bombed.</p>

Released in 1972, Pong, which crudely approximates table tennis, was among the first video games created, and the early arcade machines it featured on now stand proudly in museums across the US. <br /><br />The game didn&rsquo;t require a huge amount of brain power, though it did need some: the capacity to predict where the opponent would send the ball; the ability to move the &ldquo;paddle&rdquo; to meet the ball in advance of its arrival. But it evidently didn&rsquo;t demand too much of the human body beyond that, as scientists at Cortical Labs in Australia have now proven.<br /><br />They have taught human brain cells in a petri dish to do more or less what kids did half a century ago, only this time the cells are playing against themselves, bouncing the ball against a virtual wall. Still, they need to operate the paddle and predict the ball&rsquo;s trajectory. <br /><br />The roughly 800,000 cells in the petri dish were sent electrical pulses via microelectrodes: if the ball is arriving at their left side, the signal goes to the left-hand side of the mass, and the same for the right-hand side. The white bar accordingly moves to meet the ball. Cortical Labs&rsquo; Brett Kagan told <em>New Scientist</em> magazine that the teaching of these &ldquo;cyborg mini-brains&rdquo;, as the team calls them, took only five minutes. <br /><br />The experiment will likely add to growing belief in the power &ndash; and scientific utility &ndash; of synthetic brains. In August last year, Science journal published a report on work done by researchers in France to create a computer simulation of the way in which neurons send information between different parts of the brain, and which could be observed mimicking the process of memory formation. A team at King&rsquo;s College London meanwhile used a combination of AI and the Cambridge-1 supercomputer, the UK&rsquo;s most powerful computer, to generate synthetic brain images that enable them to observe how certain illnesses or ageing-related processes trigger changes in the brain over time &ndash; all without needing to place actual humans in an MRI tunnel. <br /><br />The prospect of cyborg brains might not sit too easily. After all, Hollywood has long been telling us that if the machines rise up, humanity will fall. But there is growing scientific support for the furthering of this kind of research, not least because it will make obsolete the invasive procedures currently required to study our brains.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist spring 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">What a way to spread the reputation of your town. New Prague High School, a little place southwest of Minneapolis, hosted a girl&#8217;s basketball game, and the <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/more-allegations-of-racist-remarks-made-by-new-prague-student-athletes-spectators">spectators started taunting the players from the Robbinsdale team</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some people in a high school basketball crowd are being accused of taunting visiting players, many of whom are students of color, with monkey noises during a close game.</p>
<p>The racist chants happened at the girl&#8217;s basketball game between Robbinsdale Cooper and New Prague in New Prague Tuesday night, according to accounts. </p>
<p>One public Facebook post, shared more than 450 times, says some adults and students supporting the home New Prague team &#8220;started to make loud MONKEY NOISES,&#8221; directed at the Robbinsdale Cooper players, as the tightly contested game neared its end. </p></blockquote>
<p>This seems to be a habit at New Prague.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damian Johnson, head boy&#8217;s basketball coach at Benilde St.-Margaret&#8217;s and former Gopher, said on Twitter he &#8220;wasn&#8217;t surprised at all&#8221; to hear Williamson&#8217;s claims. He told Bring Me The News that during a Jan. 31 game between the Benilde and New Prague 9B teams, two girls in the stands referred to a Benilde player as a &#8220;monkey&#8221; while he shot free throws.</p>
<p>A player on the St. Louis Park boy&#8217;s hockey team said similar comments were made during the school&#8217;s game against New Prague this Tuesday. At least two New Prague players, he told Bring Me The News, called a student on the St. Louis Park team a &#8220;monkey&#8221; and told him to &#8220;go back to the 1860s&#8221; as that player was leaving the ice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other schools are <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2022/02/22/st-louis-park-cancels-remaining-games-with-new-prague-after-allegedly-racist-taunts/">responding strongly</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a response to alleged racist taunts during a Feb. 15 high school boys hockey game, St. Louis Park will not compete in any contests against New Prague for at least until the end of the school year.</p>
<p>In an email to New Prague athletics director Brad Skogerboe sent on Monday, St. Louis Park AD Andrew Ewald said the ban “will continue until the harm that was caused is repaired and we are assured that any of our stakeholders, most importantly our students, will not be victimized by racism by any New Prague stakeholder in the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/StLouisPark.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/StLouisPark-500x560.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="560" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65735" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/StLouisPark-500x560.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/StLouisPark-134x150.jpeg 134w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/StLouisPark-268x300.jpeg 268w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/StLouisPark-768x860.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/02/StLouisPark.jpeg 1002w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>But wait &#8212; that seems backward. The schools with black students are canceling their competitions with New Prague? Does that mean the racist high school wins in a forfeit? The penalty ought to be that New Prague is not allowed to compete. Further, apparently New Prague only recently applied to, and was accepted into, the West Metro conference. Kick them out. There&#8217;s no excuse for tolerating that kind of behavior.</p>

These eight-legged micro-organisms &ndash; also called water bears &ndash; are extremophiles, meaning that while they might live in a mossy corner of your garden, they can also survive in extremely hostile climes: temperatures ranging from near absolute zero to well over 100C and pressures found in the deepest ocean.<br /><br />This makes them well suited to space, particularly given their high tolerance for cosmic radiation. Chances are that tardigrades are currently living on the moon, deposited there by an Israeli spacecraft as part of a &ldquo;lunar library&rdquo; back in 2019 (see Kit Chapman on page 18). That&rsquo;s not to say that they&rsquo;re crawling around. Instead, they will have entered a form of suspended animation, adopting a dehydrated spore-like state. But should anyone administer a drop of reviving water, they could well spring back to life.<br /><br />Tardigrades have a raft of strange biological adaptations, which we&rsquo;re only beginning to understand. They contain a unique DNA damage suppressor protein that protects their genetic material from the radicals formed when high energy ionising radiation interacts with water. They also contain an unusual amount of intrinsically disordered proteins. (Most proteins, in contrast, adopt a fixed 3D shape.) <br /><br />Recently, Martin Blackledge and his team at the Institute of Structural Biology in France may have discovered a reason why they produce quite so much disordered protein. When one of these proteins was cooled or dehydrated, it formed a fibrous gel. Intriguingly, this gel protected other, more structured proteins, allowing them to stay folded and functional in the absence of the aqueous conditions normally needed to maintain their shape.<br /><br />For now, these observations have only been made with proteins isolated from the tardigrades, so how (or if) the protective mechanisms work within living organisms is still a puzzle. But it does provide yet another example of the water bears&rsquo; bizarre biochemistry. It also leads to the tantalising idea that the mechanisms used by tardigrades to protect themselves from harsh conditions could be utilised to prolong the shelf-life of protein-based therapeutics.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the Witness section of New Humanist spring 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="Geoffrey Nice, who headed the independent people's Uyghur Tribunal (Lily Vetch)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/9R5A7120-v4.jpg" height="1105" alt="Geoffrey Nice" width="1562" /><br /></em></p> <p><em>Sir Geoffrey Nice QC headed the independent people&rsquo;s Uyghur Tribunal &ndash; an unofficial body of lawyers, academics and businesspeople, based in the UK. In December 2021 it delivered its verdict that China is committing genocide against the Uyghur minority, prompting British MPs to form a cross-party group urging the government to use the same term. In the early 2000s, Nice led the prosecution at the trial of former Serbian president Slobodan Milo&scaron;ević.</em></p> <p><strong>You recently headed a People&rsquo;s Tribunal on the Uyghur in China, which ruled that The People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) is committing genocide against the Muslim minority. How did you reach that verdict? </strong></p> <p>How can one draw general conclusions about an enormous geographical area like Xinjiang Province, which is three times the size of France, from a limited number of in-person witness? First, there was very similar evidence from people not connected to one another, speaking of different camps around Xinjiang. Were these similarities indicative of what is happening in Xinjiang being done pursuant to a policy? If the same thing happens at the hand of officials in Huddersfield as in Penzance and Margate and is evidenced by people who don't know each other, then that's a pointer towards a wider, national policy. Then there were reports from organisations like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch that drew on Uyghur witness testimony, as well as leaked policy documents from the Chinese Communist Party. Those documents set out government and party approaches to the Uyghurs on matters of detention, birth control and so on. There were reports of women detainees forced to take medicine that affected their reproductive functioning, pregnant women forced to undergo abortions, intense surveillance in the community generally, family members incentivised to spy on one another, children forced into state-run boarding schools, and more.</p> <p>As individual accounts from witnesses fitted with all evidence cited in other reports and government policy then what was happening, it could be concluded, was pursuant to a province-wide policy. The tribunal then applied the strictest test of proof beyond reasonable doubt to factual evidence in order to reach factual findings <em>and</em> applied only the law on genocide &ndash; which is subject to some uncertainties and complexities &ndash; about which it could be certain. Accordingly, on the basis of evidence heard in public, the tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, as the judgement read, &ldquo;the PRC, by the imposition of measures to prevent births, intended to <em>destroy</em> a significant part of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang as such, has committed genocide&rdquo;.</p> <p><strong>Many in China appear to believe that the Uyghur population does constitute a security threat, and that the Chinese state&rsquo;s actions are justified. Critics of the ruling Communist Party conversely see a state project to impose a singular Han identity on China. What do you see as the motivation there?</strong></p> <p>You won&rsquo;t find any serious commentator who would say that there is <em>no</em> background of actions by Uyghurs that could represent a security concern; but there's been very little, if anything, recently. Equally, evidence of the encouragement given to Han men to marry Uyghur women clearly speaks to a policy of homogenisation of races. And it was very important at all times to correct the loose public discourse about what's happening in Xinjiang being in some way similar to the Holocaust. It's absolutely nothing like the Holocaust. The Holocaust was concerned with eliminating an ethnic group in Europe altogether. It wasn&rsquo;t concerned with intermarrying; it wasn't concerned with releasing people from death camps back into the community.</p> <p>What&rsquo;s happening in China is very different to what happened to the Jews. We explained at the beginning of the judgment how cautious we were about making a finding of genocide because of the term being rooted, in the popular understanding, in the Holocaust. As to what the overall motivation of the Chinese state is, it would be an overreach of us to make any general finding given the People&rsquo;s Republic of China&rsquo;s management structure, its way of decision-making, its formation of &ndash; and the changeability of &ndash; policy. So, with evidence of a range of motivations, it would be foolish to exclude any one of them &ndash; terrorism or homogenising the population for example, altogether.</p> <p><strong>The tribunal judgement wrote: &ldquo;It is essential to recognise that actions seen as wholly wrong and beyond justification by citizens of liberal democracies, might to citizens of China seem genuinely acceptable and justified for the public good.&rdquo; Why is this point worthy of acknowledgement?</strong></p> <p>It is really wrong to view other people's actions through the lens of one type of society &ndash; in this case, our own &ndash; and with the sensibilities and expectations that such a society may generate. Instead, go back to the terms of the Genocide Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which were signed or acceded to by China / the PRC, the Convention being partly drafted by a Confucian philosopher, Peng-chun Chang. Those international instruments show that whatever the differences in public acceptability of state conduct &ndash; say of the use of force by the police or the methods of detention and so on &ndash; there are standards of conduct necessary for human rights to be respected that are universally acknowledged.</p> <p>There is a great deal of excited commentary around the Uyghur issue that, on examination, clearly applies North European standards. When looking at the PRC, apart from acknowledging its size and its historic misfortune at the hands of others, including our nation, it is very important to recognise that the PRC has done a great deal for its citizens, many of whom are now rich by western standards, having earlier raised millions out of poverty. One should be respectful of its history. It may well be that the citizens of the PRC prefer an authoritarian ruler to the form of government that Westminster offers British people; with such preference may come acceptance of state actions that might be unacceptable elsewhere. The tribunal&rsquo;s job was only to consider and apply the international criminal law that was developed after the Second World War. The tribunal allowed no hint of soft-centred western democratic thinking to enter into its deliberations. There would be no benefit or value in doing that. Likewise emotional response to the evidence would have been of no value.</p> <p><strong>The so-called &ldquo;re-education camps&rdquo; for Uyghurs have been widely reported on. But what did the testimony illustrate in terms of how Uyghurs outside of the camps are policed, and how all-consuming is the state&rsquo;s genocidal project?</strong></p> <p>There was one witness who&rsquo;d been detained in a camp then released then detained again. He said he was actually happier in detention because the nature of control inside was certain, whereas the level and nature of control outside was limitless but uncertain. For example, if you simply went into a mosque, according to some evidence we saw, you exposed yourself to risk of being persecuted and detained; the mosques were emptied and many closed altogether by actions of the state. You had to hand over your phone at checkpoints and everything would be downloaded from the phone. The PRC called this element of download technology their &ldquo;anti-terrorism sword&rdquo;. There were very many other elements of extreme observations and control.</p> <p><strong>Tell us what motivated the founding of a People&rsquo;s Tribunal.</strong></p> <p>We can start with the statement given by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1966 at the beginning of the Russell Tribunal on the Vietnam War. &ldquo;The Tribunal is not a substitute for any institution already in existence: it is, on the contrary, formed out of a void and for a real need.&rdquo; The tribunal said is that it would do this job because others who might have done it did not do as they should have done. Our only interest was in filling a gap of knowledge left needlessly by the failure of governments and other bodies to conduct proper public evidence-based investigation or inquiry. That was the motivating factor. Nothing else. Very serious allegations have been made about a country far away. It&rsquo;s a country that provides the computers we use, the clothes we wear, a country that sends its students here, that funds educational and artistic enterprises here. Even though it&rsquo;s a long way away, the public effectively interacts with China from the moment they buy a t-shirt or computer. And they need to know what is happening in the country where these things are produced. If unbelievable horrors were reported was happening in Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands &ndash; our nearest neighbours &ndash; would it be proper for that information to be made available to the citizens of this country so they can make informed decisions about things they buy? The answer is that of course you need to make it public; of course it would be wrong not to.</p> <p><strong>You led the prosecution at the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. How has your confidence in the ability of international courts to bring justice to victims of genocide and crimes against humanity developed since then?</strong></p> <p>One way of looking at international justice is that it&rsquo;s probably a great deal better than nothing, and nothing is what you had in the 19th century. It was only in the last quarter of the 19th century that the world began to regulate the conduct of war, and only at the beginning of the 20th century that contemplation was given to the post-facto oversight of wrongdoing in war by law. That then developed to a significant extent after the Second World War with the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals and &ndash; later &ndash; with the international tribunals in the 1990s on Rwanda and Yugoslavia. All of that is within quite a short time in historical terms.</p> <p>International law is still in an experimental phase. It&rsquo;s probably too early to make anything like a comprehensive or final evaluation of whether international justice is working, and it&rsquo;s much more important to see what shortcomings there are and try to help people remove them. But most important of all is to say that all of us must hope that some form of &ldquo;law not war&rdquo; &ndash; the phrase that Ben Ferencz, who was chief prosecutor at one of the Nuremberg Trials, uses &ndash; might come about. The pre-First World War enthusiasm for avoiding all war and making all conflicts subject to arbitration or discussion without killing people failed in the 20th century, and it doesn&rsquo;t look much better now. I know Steven Pinker may say that numerically we&rsquo;re killing less, and that may be true, perhaps because we have better targeted weapons. But the desire to attack and fight seems pretty well with us, and the desire to do damage to particular races is often present. The absolutely critical thing for anyone to understand is that, even if you can see the shortcomings of the legal system, it&rsquo;s a great deal better than what came before, and therefore everyone must give their support to it.</p> <p><em>This is the full version of our Q&amp;A from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="An island in the Kiribati atoll in the South Pacific (Flickr/Charly W. Karl) " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/12644930893_b0dd6ec54e_b.jpg" height="640" alt="Kiribati" width="1024" /></em></p> <p><em>Atossa Araxia Abrahamian is a US-based journalist and author of &ldquo;The Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen&rdquo;. She is working on a second book on extraterritorial jurisdictions for Riverhead Books.</em></p> <p><strong>The first nations to become uninhabitable as seas rise will be small island states like Kiribati in the South Pacific, home to some 115,000 people. Under current legal regimes, what will happen to the citizenship status of inhabitants once they are forced to migrate? </strong></p> <p>We know that rising sea levels will force many, many people to move. The vast majority of them will be internally displaced, but some will have to leave their homes for other countries because the environments they live in will be unsuitable for living. Still, there&rsquo;s no reason why these individuals would necessarily become <em>stateless </em>in this process &shy;&ndash; at least in the foreseeable future &ndash; since countries like Kiribati or Vanuatu are unlikely to disappear entirely. If the past behaviour of nations tells us anything, we can safely assume they will cling to their statehood with all their might.</p> <p>International law seems, for now, to be on their side. There&rsquo;s no minimum landmass for a country to be considered a state, so even if coastlines erode and landmass is diminished, I don&rsquo;t see the UN stepping in and un-recognising a country just because it got smaller or lost a significant portion of its population. If it did that, it would have to evict the Holy See, which barely covers half a square kilometre. So, for a while at least this question is academic.</p> <p>There is all the same a threshold at which what&rsquo;s known as a juridical &ldquo;island&rdquo; becomes a juridical &ldquo;rock&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s not theoretically impossible for an island nation to get downgraded. That will happen when it can no longer sustain life &ndash; environmentally (i.e., no drinking water) or economically (no way for people to make a living.) I also really can&rsquo;t imagine states forfeiting their sovereignty for lack of land or population. Countries have been governed from abroad during wartime, for example. What is more likely is that nations will build artificial islands to replace the submerged ones &ndash; the Maldives is doing this right now, and states like Singapore and China have also &ldquo;reclaimed&rdquo; parts of the sea to extend their own territorial reach, even without this existential threat.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s tempting to jump to wild conclusions and solutions to the problem of submerged islands, but as novel as these situations are, we&rsquo;re dealing with much more prosaic and intractable problems: how to make sure people in dangerous situations find a safe landing place where they can live, work, get an education and have a normal life.</p> <p><strong>The question of future citizenship is often sidelined in discussions around the effects of the climate crisis, which tends to focus on direct material impacts &ndash; flooding, drought, food shortages, and so on. But what will the lived experiences of those fleeing sinking states to other countries be? </strong></p> <p>I can&rsquo;t speak to the emotional aspect of losing a homeland to this kind of tragedy, particularly for people with traditions that are inextricably linked to that land. But climate refugees will, on top of this heartbreak, be faced with all of the obstacles that other kinds of migrants deal with: namely, how will they get the right work and residence papers? This will depend on whether individual host nations grant them rights though ordinary immigration channels, or through exceptional visas, like the ones the US grants to citizens of places that have experienced disasters.</p> <p>There are other types of precarity: How will they adapt and integrate into a new society? How will they maintain a sense of their identity &ndash; cultural, national or otherwise &ndash; without a place to go &ldquo;back&rdquo; to? It&rsquo;s not impossible to hang onto heritage even without places or even passports: the Chagossians, who were forcibly displaced from the island of Diego Garcia by the British so that the US could build a military base some 50 years ago, have a thriving community and even a football team in the UK. And of course, Russian emigr&eacute;s after the Revolution did not recognise their new government, were not recognised <em>by</em> the Soviet government, yet maintained an unbelievably rich literary and cultural tradition from abroad.</p> <p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that human cultures are much more than a bit of land, and if given the resources to live comfortable and rich lives in a new place, I don&rsquo;t see them giving up their heritage. The key is to make it possible for people to move safely to places that welcome them. That&rsquo;s a gigantic challenge, even in the absence of climate change.</p> <p><strong>You&rsquo;ve written widely on the uneven global playing field for citizenship eligibility, and especially on the financial elites of the world who can buy passports with ease. Citizenship has long been widely understood as primarily a matter of blood or soil. But how central a role will wealth play as the world heats up?</strong></p> <p>Money will continue to help rich people migrate more easily and keep less rich people in place. Rich people will also look to buy passports, property and land in areas they deem safe or sheltered from the worst effects of global warming. But my prediction here is that there will be more options for moderately well-off people to buy residence or citizenship as populations in Europe age and more states seek to attract educated, working-age populations. This won&rsquo;t do a thing to help the poorest and least privileged people in the world. But money will certainly not be eliminated from the migration equation.</p> <p><strong>Some have advocated for a decoupling of citizenship from territory as one answer to an increase in global statelessness. But what would that look like in reality? </strong></p> <p>This has been done before! In 1922, the head of the UN refugee agency, a Norwegian statesman named Fritzdjof Nansen, came up with what was known as the &ldquo;Nansen passport&rdquo; for people displaced by war and revolution in Russia, Armenia, and beyond. The document was a stateless person&rsquo;s passport, and while it wasn&rsquo;t always as &ldquo;good&rdquo; (in terms of access and acceptance) as an ordinary passport, it allowed close to half a million people to prove their identity, cross borders, and find new homes. Now, you can probably imagine how politically impossible this kind of endeavour would be today, but it&rsquo;s worth remembering that in times of crisis, wild ideas become possible.</p> <p>Since Nansen&rsquo;s day, the international community has passed lots of treaties and conventions to deal with refugees and statelessness, but none of them are quite up to the task of dealing with the climate crisis. The 1951 Refugee convention&rsquo;s standard rationale for a person to be considered a refugee is &ldquo;fear of persecution&rdquo; and it doesn&rsquo;t really apply to, say, an eroding coastline and no means of growing food. Still, there have been plenty of discussions around whether it can be adapted. One argument is that the convention <em>could</em> apply because the victims of climate change <em>become</em> marginalised and at risk of persecution because of their vulnerable position. Climate defenders may also have a claim to fearing persecution when they come up against, say, oil companies or governments defending corporate interests.</p> <p>This convention may prove too outdated; we may have to come up with new ones. But whatever happens, I do think we&rsquo;re going to have to think in less territorial terms. There&rsquo;s always been a premium on land throughout human history, and the paradox of climate change is that preserving it has at once never been more important to our physical survival, nor more important to think beyond its constraints politically and philosophically.</p> <p><strong>Is there any evidence that the world is moving in such a direction &ndash; that the state model is declining? If anything, many nations over the past decade appear to have doubled their efforts to ensure absolute sovereignty and some degree of homogeneity of their populations, so the prospect of new arrivals being given their full legal rights seems to be diminishing. </strong></p> <p>I don&rsquo;t believe the state as an institution is in decline, but states are definitely looking to augment or supplement their territorial footprint with digital and extraterritorial holdings as a way of maintaining and defending their sovereignty. The Bahamas made a splash recently because they opened an embassy in the Metaverse. Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s new NEOM project is promising &ldquo;mixed-reality&rdquo; experience, both in the physical and digital realms, where individuals can access services from far away as well as on the ground. We&rsquo;re seeing crypto-currencies decoupled (in theory) from countries, and even residence decoupled from places, in the case of Estonia, which offers e-residency to entrepreneurs looking to use the country&rsquo;s business and tech infrastructure.</p> <p>And look at us &ndash; we&rsquo;ve been stuck on Zoom meetings in our pyjamas for two years now!</p> <p>Where all this is leading is obviously up in the air, but taken together, with the backdrop of climate disaster, I&rsquo;m inclined to believe that the deterritorialisation of parts of our lives and political systems will continue.</p> <p><em>This is the full version of our Q&amp;A from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic.

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
