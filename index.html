<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering what it is, it&#8217;s a small Faraday cage for people who are sensitive (they think) to EMF radiation. These are designed for you to place your WiFi router in so that it will stop hosing your house with 2.4-5 gigaherz radiation. Which is the whole point of a WiFi router. So yeah, you go drop <a href="https://amzn.to/33JAvKV">$100</a> on a router so you can browse the internet, and then cage it up in a metal box so you can&#8217;t browse the internet. Brilliant!</p>
<p>Another amazing thing: those cages have a significant number of 5-star reviews. I guess they work!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Still from Steve McQueen&rsquo;s 'Mangrove'" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/mangrove-2020-in-the-dock-1.jpg" alt="mangrove-2020-in-the-dock-1" /></p> <p class="p1">I&rsquo;m standing on the deck of the new Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS <em>Queen Elizabeth</em>, looking down at a remarkable view. I can see the multi-decked black and gold hull of Nelson&rsquo;s ship HMS <em>Victory</em>, standing high in Portsmouth&rsquo;s historic Naval Dockyard. Even across 200 years you can see the connection between these two vessels &ndash; both, in their own eras, absolute cutting-edge feats of engineering.</p> <p class="p2">Another perspective comes unexpectedly at dinner in the officers&rsquo; mess to commemorate Trafalgar Day: the anniversary of Vice-Admiral Nelson&rsquo;s victory over the French and Spanish fleets in 1805. This year is a modest, socially distanced affair, without the usual swagger of its full rituals. But the toast to Nelson is always a simple one, focused on the dead: &ldquo;The Immortal Memory of Lord Nelson and those who fell with him&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the only toast taken in silence and, even for those otherwise uncomfortable with the pomp of military displays, a moving reminder of those unfamous men who died. Amid the current interest, led by some politicians, in provoking a culture war over contested history (and Nelson is very contested), the simple commemoration at the heart of the Royal Navy&rsquo;s Trafalgar Day was a useful reminder of the need to go to the source of traditions and examine what really lies there. It is possible to respect the heroic human loss while still confronting concerns about Nelson&rsquo;s connection to slavery.</p> <p class="p2">Steve McQueen&rsquo;s <em>Small Axe</em> film anthology for the BBC is a collection of previously untold histories &ndash; not &ldquo;black British history&rdquo;, as he says himself, but &ldquo;British history&rdquo;. The first, <em>Mangrove</em>, airing from November, recounts the trial of nine men and women charged with incitement to riot in 1970, following a protest against police targeting of the Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill. Shot documentary style, the film evokes the unique West Indian character of the area, where intellectuals like C. L. R. James, author of <em>Black Jacobins</em>, debated colonial history, while fighting to protect a restaurant at the heart of their community. When they finally launch an angry protest march, carrying &ndash; it&rsquo;s shocking to see it &ndash; a real pig&rsquo;s head to police headquarters, they are met with violence.</p> <p class="p2">The Mangrove Nine faced a possible ten-year sentence. We see the angry courtroom exchanges, where the arrogance of the judge, barristers and mendacious officers was challenged and finally led to surprise landmark acquittals by the mostly white jury. Alongside the fight for justice, there is celebratory beauty: McQueen gives us long takes of friends and activists, including their white allies, drinking and dancing with joy.</p> <p class="p2"><em>Mangrove</em> shows the political fierceness of its heroes and the personal risks they faced. Altheia Jones-LeCointe, leader of the British Black Panther movement, was pregnant during her trial. Both she and Darcus Howe, the broadcaster and campaigner, insisted on representing themselves. Jones-LeCointe carried the anguish of knowing her child might be taken into care if she was convicted.</p> <p class="p2">The Mangrove Nine were very aware of the historical importance of their fight; of what it meant to other black Britons to defy the false accusations, rather than bow to the pressure to plead guilty and secure a lesser sentence.</p> <p class="p4">The battle between the personal and the political emerges in unexpected places. Rapper Tupac Shakur, himself the son of a Black Panther activist, wrote movingly to a former white girlfriend in 1995 explaining why he felt his racial responsibility meant they could not continue their relationship. That partner was Madonna, whose entire career has been marred by relatives and work associates selling stories to monetise their connection. The letter, written from prison, first came to public attention when it was put up for auction in 2017 through her former assistant. Madonna temporarily won a court order to block the sale on grounds of privacy. That ruling was subsequently overturned and the auction went ahead last year.</p> <p class="p2">So it feels right that Madonna will make a film of her own life, which looks set to be under her control. Much excitement greeted the announcement that she will be producing and co-writing the biopic, along with Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody, of <em>Juno</em> and <em>Young Adult</em> fame, part of an all-female writing and directing team. It will not be impartial. It will be, in every sense, Herstory.</p> <p class="p2">There might not seem to be much linking British naval history, racial injustice and women in music. But in each case, remembrance matters. We need to tell old or hidden stories, in new ways, to fill the gaps and challenge official versions of history.</p> <p class="p2"><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2020 edition. </em><em><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2011-74-Endgame-_1_.jpg" alt="2011-74-Endgame-_1_" /></p> <p class="p1">It was, in all respects, another typical Covid evening. We&rsquo;d finished our regulation bottle of Chianti, yet again postponed our online Italian lesson, and decided that not one of the films on television merited a moment of our time. Three vacant hours lay between us and bedtime.</p> <p class="p3">Not so long ago, on a strikingly similar evening, we&rsquo;d tried to fill the impasse by recalling our respective teenage years. What was our favourite music? Our hopes for the future? Our unforgettable moments? It successfully passed the time until my partner Sally tired of talking about her love of Carole King and began speaking rather too energetically about the teenage affair she&rsquo;d enjoyed with Geoff. Geoff somebody or other. I forget the surname.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;I can see him now,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Very tall for his age. And very athletic. And surprisingly sensitive. We used to read poetry to each other. Shelley and Keats and Wordsworth.&rdquo; If only I could have matched this with an adolescent romance of my own. But as soon as I recognised that my messy attempts to get off with Sheila Wilson during the dance at Brownmoor Youth Club were hardly comparable to her spiritual liaison with the &ldquo;surprisingly sensitive&rdquo; Geoff, I knew it was time to abandon past lives as a topic to fill the long Covid evenings.</p> <p class="p3">And then, a few weeks ago, when we&rsquo;d both decided that we&rsquo;d lost the plot of <em>Killing Eve</em>, I came up with a casual suggestion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favourite joke?&rdquo; I asked her. At first she didn&rsquo;t want to play. &ldquo;Jokes are so terribly male, so horribly macho,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Lots of hairy men standing around in a pub, downing pints and shrieking with laughter about cocks and tits.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there any feminist jokes?&rdquo; I wondered.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Mmm. Well, there is the very special advice about how to get rid of the snails in your garden.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;You just tell them that you love them madly and want to have their baby and you won&rsquo;t see them for dust.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&lsquo;&ldquo;Any more?&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Dolly Parton one.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;Somebody asked her how long it took to do her hair and she said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m never there.&rsquo; Your turn.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">I settled back on the sofa. My turn. Good. I&rsquo;ve been collecting jokes since I was seven years old. My battered diary from that period even lists some of my childhood favourites. &ldquo;Which nation uses the most cold cream?&rdquo; Answer: The Japanese (the chappy knees). &ldquo;What is brown, hairy and wears sunglasses?&rdquo; Answer: A coconut on holiday. Boom boom.</p> <p class="p3">Something a little more mature was called for. A riddle. &ldquo;What does a dyslexic, agnostic, insomniac do at night?&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;I give up.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;He stays up wondering if there is a dog.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a typical man joke. Very clever. Very &lsquo;look at me&rsquo;. Not as funny as the story about the vicar&rsquo;s wife who gazes lovingly at a dress in a shop window. Guiltily she goes in and tries it on. It&rsquo;s gorgeous. &lsquo;Get thee behind me, Satan,&rsquo; she murmurs to herself. A second later she&rsquo;s alarmed to hear a whispered reply. &lsquo;It looks all right from here,&rsquo; says the hidden voice.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">We&rsquo;ve now been at it, hammer and tongs, giggle and chuckle, for over three weeks. It doesn&rsquo;t always work. Some of my partner&rsquo;s feminist gags have become a tad too polemical. &ldquo;How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb? None. You don&rsquo;t need light bulbs when you have a glass ceiling.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did God invent men? Because vibrators can&rsquo;t mow the lawn.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Occasionally we find one with mutual appeal. It&rsquo;s usually the daftest ones. Like the story of a man doing some woodwork in his garden. His neighbour, looking over the fence, hears a hacking noise coming from the man&rsquo;s bedroom. &ldquo;Is that your wife coughin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he shouts. &ldquo;Her coffin?&rdquo; says the man in the garden. &ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m just mending the dog kennel.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">It would, of course, be appropriate to end this rather sentimental story of how to escape hours of boredom with an actual Covid joke. But I fear you&rsquo;d have to wait two weeks to see if you got it.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2020 edition. </em><em><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

In this series, we're talking about things like faith and fraternity, charity in virtue, racism and identity. Our guests include people like the sociologist Jason Arday, talking about music, race and nostalgia, and the anthropologist Joseph Webster discussing faith, fraternity and community. But today, a topic that endures perhaps above all else: sex, or more precisely, sex robots.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Our guest today is Kate Devlin: She's a leading thinker in the fascinating field of intimacy, technology and how they relate. She's Senior Lecturer in the department of digital humanities at King's College London, and her research looks at human computer interaction and artificial intelligence. Her latest book <em>Turned On: Science, Sex, and Robots </em>confirmed her as an expert on sex robots. It takes a reasoned approach to a subject to ridden with moral panic. When we caught up with Kate, we started by asking her why it's important to take an academic look at something that people might think is just a bit of fun.</p> <p><strong>Kate Devlin: </strong></p> <p>I think that's one of the problems, isn't it, that you really have to justify it when you go into academia to look at things that aren't considered academic. So something that's so fundamental to us, like intimacy, and like sex and like love, are never really treated as academic things. They're not seen as being worthy of our examination, which I think is quite sad, because it's something that's so intrinsic to our well being and to us as people. So you do usually have to justify it in terms of health or psychology and things like that. So I thought it was important to really go and have a look in depth at those things and give them the academic treatment.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I mean, your book comes with a warning to readers that if they're looking for just salacious sound bites, then they should go elsewhere. And also you discuss, as a sex robot expert, that you've had to deal with quite a lot of simplification that surrounds that subject. I wondered if you could give us some examples of that kind of sensationalism or moral panic that you've encountered in your research.</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>One of the motivating factors was the the amount of headlines, especially coming out of tabloid papers about how sex robots were coming, they were going to take over the world, we're going to replace women or we'll all end up in relationships with machines. And I couldn't really see how that would play out in real life. So I wanted to mythbust in many ways, because there is a panic. That panic's very natural for humans, when we come across new pieces of technology, we do get quite scared. And it's a fear that goes into the idea that we're going to lose control, the idea that we're going to lose agency. And I wanted to explore that in that light.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>So let's start at the beginning. When was the very first sex robot?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>It depends what you want to count as a sex robot. There are stories that go right back to Ancient Greece that talk about people trying to create a perfect artificial lover. And that's a trope that's lasted millennia. So down the centuries, we see these stories about how to create that perfect partner. But it wasn't until really the past few years that people have tried to build one. And that's because the technology is at a stage where we can get something that resembles a human, I will not say is unmistakably human, because we're a very long way from that. But there was a number of companies that create very high end sex dolls, and they've decided to introduce some kind of interactivity into the dolls.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And how has the tech progressed, in the years since those very first sex robots that resemble humans were created?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>Well, it's all moving quite slowly, really, because there's not really any commercially available sex robots right now. There are prototypes that have been built by one or two companies and and by people out on their own just trying to build these things, garage builders, as we like to call them, so it's really not advanced at all. But they are making progression, in that there are there's some good robotics going on. There's some interesting work around conversational AI, but it's really not very advanced.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>It seems that humanity's been drawn to the idea of sex robots since ancient times. And I think if I'm right, one of the earliest stories is actually a woman that creates a sort of form of a husband in Greek mythology. But when we hear the term "sex robot" now we might have a certain image that says kind of hyper sexualized, pornified female form. That may be simplistic but we're not completely wrong, are we? The industry does seem to be quite dominated by the male gaze at the moment.</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>Yes, it's very much technology created by men for men. And it's because it comes out of that sex doll market. So that's again, something that the customer base tends to be straight men with enough money to be able to invest in these things. And there hasn't really been critical research into who might want a sex robot and why. It tends to be more a natural extension of the market that was already there.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And some campaigners have opposed sex robots on the grounds that they assume it will encourage objectification of women. But some of your research in the book suggests that actually, these men who own sex robots tend on the whole to worship them. And so that's really interesting. What do you think's going on there?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>It's difficult because as a feminist, I do not want in any way to perpetuate objectification of women. We see enough of that in all other walks of life that we don't need it from our technology as well. But in the case of the sex dolls, so I've done research into the community of people who own these dolls, and they own them for a number of reasons. Some of them really like the idea of companionship, and they project the idea of companionship onto the dolls, they treat them really well. They dress them up, they live with them, they invent backstories, for them, they give them names. For others, it's more of an aesthetic thing. So they collect, they model them and photograph them. For others, it's just like a collector, like collecting a piece of art. So it's a very diverse community. But by and large, everyone that I spoke to was incredibly respectful of the dolls that they owned, not just because they're investing a lot of money into this, but because for them, it represents something that they cherish. And I don't have that same fear that some people do that this is in some way, being used as an outlet for male violence. I just never saw any evidence of that at all.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>So would it be would I be right in saying that you don't think there's any real evidence to say that men who own sex robots are more likely to denigrate women in real life outside of their relationship with a sex robot?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>No, there was really not any evidence pointing to that at all. And I think we see similar comparisons around other things, like the idea the concern that computer games might lead to violence in real life, and there's simply no evidence for that. It just doesn't play out. Or that increased consumption of porn will lead to increased sexual violence in the real world. And actually, given the huge scale of porn that is accessible online, today, we have not seen a corresponding rise in sexual violence. That's not to say that porn does not have other influences that can be negative. But in terms of violence, that's not playing out.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And so one of the other arguments that often gets made about sex robots is that they could bring about the end of human to human relationships, which seems like quite an enormous thing to pin onto a piece of technology. I wondered what your thoughts were on that and where that fear might come from.</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>I think it's a really simple fear to identify in terms of, we don't want to lose our position, we want to be the ultimate to everyone. So we want humans to stay at the pinnacle of all things. And we have that similar fear around things like automation, as well, and job loss. And actually, it's much more realistic, the fear around automation and job loss, it's much more compelling a fear, in terms of replacing human human relationships, I just don't see it. We are intrinsically as humans hardwired genetically, to want to meet with other humans and pass those genes on. Some people act on that, some people don't. So I think that we're never going to see that go away. But for some people, maybe that's an option, that they can have some sense of companionship, some sense of intimacy, with a piece of technology. And I don't feel it's my place to judge, if that's what they want to do.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And you've made the point that that could be quite a distinct kind of emotional and sexual attachment, that's quite different from the attachment that we might get from human to human relationships. But can you talk a bit about what what that might look like? Or is it just completely different in different scenarios?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>it's all about how we put things into social categories. So we're very good at identifying how people fit into different social categories. And we address them in different ways, depending on the context. And I don't think that robots are a replacement for humans. I don't think we're trying to just slot in any sphere, not just in terms of sex and intimacy. I don't think we're trying to slot robots in and say here as a replacement human, what we're seeing is an emergence of a new social class. And there are some really interesting studies out there. So Julie Carpenter, who's looked at military robots, has identified this as well, that we we are engaging with the technology in new ways, but we are very clear all along that it is a piece of technology. So there's no deception going on. There's not some illusion about this. We accommodate it into our lives and we adapt to it.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And what about the question of love? So is it possible to feel love when the emotion only runs one way? You've spoken about the fact that men who own these bits of technology are often very respectful, and might behave in ways that we equate with love. But I wonder, can love exist in that direction only?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>I think in real life, love exists in that direction only as well. So there are plenty of people out there in love with others who don't even know they exist. And I think that it's very different to get your head around the idea that that might be a piece of technology that can't love you back. But I don't think it's that unrealistic. We feel attachment to many different things. And it may not be the same as a loving two way relationship where the love is coming back to you. But there's certainly attachment you can feel, and we see this to a lesser extent in other bits of technology, the people who anecdotally report that they really enjoy the the robot vacuum cleaner that they have that becomes almost like a pet, or having conversations with Alexa, if you're feeling a bit lonely. So I think, then, that the idea of forming some kind of friendship or companionship with a machine is not far fetched. And although the machine can't feel - we may never have machines that can actually feel anything, they can certainly give the portrayal and the illusion of responding to your moods, and they can give the idea that they are interested. And that might be enough for us to buy into it, and think that the machine cares and allow us, not in a deceptive way, but just to allow us enough to feel that rapport.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>In the book, you go and visit one of these sex robots that has different moods. Can you just talk a bit about how that actually works in practice? And also following up on that that, could we begin to talk about robot emotion or even robot love?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>The robot that I went to visit was by a company called Real Doll who make a robot called Harmony who is a sex doll with an animatronic head, so she can smile and she can turn her head and blink. And I'm calling her "she" - these are incredibly gendered. So she does look a bit like a giant Barbie doll, a very expensive giant Barbie doll. And Harmony robot has an AI personality. And that personality can stand alone as an app. So you can actually download this app onto your smartphone. And you can have this virtual girlfriend as a conversational tool. And you can set and tweak the parameters. So if you decide that you want to have her talk to you in a flirtatious mode, or in a loving mode, or in a jokey mode, you can tweak all of these parameters to get a personality of sorts that you want to interact with. So it is very much like programming your partner like on demand, mood matching, which you know, is itself an incredibly interesting phenomenon. And how does that go if you can actually build something to your demand? Does that take away from the idea of human interactions, whether it's kickback, for example? But this robot, you can control the the way that she speaks to you.</p> <p>I mean, it would not be difficult, it would not be exceptionally difficult to program one that behaves more randomly, so you wouldn't have to control necessarily the personality. But that's the way it's been set up for now. But of course, this is very, very limited. So because this is essentially a sex doll with some robotics, the body of the robot can't stand up on her own or anything like that. She has to be propped up. It's just the head. There's no other movement in the limbs, although they're working on that. So it's still quite limited. The people who built it, really their motivation was this companionship element. And if you go on to their website, it's very, very clearly marketing this via companionship means, via the language of romance and the language of relationships, rather than sex. And certainly, the people I've spoken to that own these sex dolls, the one thing they say when you say "if you could tell the world about your sex doll, what would it be?" And they say, "Tell them it's not about sex. That's not what it's about." And there are people who are fetishists, who want the fact that it is a doll, and they are turned on by the fact that it is a doll, but by and large, it's about companionship, and this robot gives them a way of taking that interaction with the doll a bit further and into the realms of physical reality.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>You're listening to With Reason from the <em>New Humanist </em>magazine with me, Niki Seth-Smith -</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And me Samira Shackle: and we're talking to Kate Devlin about her book <em>Turned On: Science, Sex and Robots</em>.

We've also talked about why people might want to own robotic sexual companions.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>But for now, that obligatory question on Covid-19. Since the pandemic hit, it appears that the appeal of virtual sex and high tech interactive sex toys has increased. So there seems to be actually some evidence that the higher risks associated with physical intimacy has led to an increase in use and sales. We asked Kate: does this also apply to sex robots?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>Sex robots still aren't commercially available, but sex dolls have apparently seen a surge in purchases due to lockdown. I talked to a couple of people who own sex dolls about this, and one of them said, it did occur to them that someone like him is probably better equipped than most to deal with an extended period of isolation at home. And so they don't feel as if they're missing out on companionship as much as someone might, who wasn't in that position. So I think that's quite a positive thing. Interestingly, amongst the community of men who own sex dolls, there's been a few investigations and studies done, and they find that rather than being isolated, the those men are forming friendship groups, because they all own sex dolls. So the very fact that they own them, gives them a route to talk to other people and to form these groups. It's actually not as isolating as you might think.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Hmm, that's so interesting. Why do you think that is that people would identify with their ownership of this thing so much that they join a support group? That isn't something you do, for instance, with another kind of sex toy that's more widely available, like a vibrator?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>I think because this is such a lifestyle thing. For many people, it becomes more than just a gadget that someone owns. There's a lot of emotion invested in it. In some ways. It's a bit like hobbyists, so the forums that people meet on to talk about it, friendships emerge from that, and carried over into real life. So there's a very strong social bond that forms between people who are facing the same kind of judgment as well. There's a lot of judgment, a lot of suspicion about men who own sex dolls. And if you can get together with groups of people and talk about that in a safe environment, then it's unsurprising that social bonds emerge.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>So do you think that this kind of sex tech is something that lots of people wouldn't mind trying, but wouldn't want to admit to wanting? We've talked a bit about the stigma around it?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>Yeah. So that's the joy of doing research into sexual interests and behavior is that people just don't want to tell you, but are really curious. So we know that people underreport things a lot when it comes to sexual experiences. I think there is definitely a curiosity for people. Maybe not necessarily around this form of technology and sex, but certainly around other forms. And it's only maybe the past 20 years that people have started to be more open about owning sex toys. So there's still quite a way to go for anything that advances on that.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And we've talked about the dominance of male gaze in the sex robots industry, but now we're broadening that to talk about more forms of sex tech. And your book emphasizes, there's all sorts of different possibilities, not necessarily sort of defined by the human form. You wrote about a surrealist game that you played at a workshop where people came up with all sorts of different creations. Can you remind us of that?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>It was really fun. So it was the game where you draw a head, you fold over the page, you pass it on to the next person, they draw the body, they fold it over, they pass it on to the next person, they draw the legs, etc, etc. And it was really fun. They said, what what could you imagine as as a piece of sex tech or sexual companion that you've created and built. It was so interesting to unwrap the paper and see things like someone who put a screen for a head, that would screen erotica, so you could read while you're having sex with this thing. Other people were putting on wings or tentacles or squidgy bodies or all sorts of things. I ran two hackathons in 2016, and again in 2017. A hackathon is a like a 24 hour prototyping tech sprint, where you come together and you build things. And we brought people from all walks of life, we brought psychologists and tech people and musicians and artists and industry experts. We got them into groups, and they looked at exploring new forms of sex and technology that went beyond the idea of the sex robot or even just the sex toy. And that was fun, because they explored not just sex but intimacy and sensuality and how could you create experiences that were remote from the other person yet, you could still feel connected. And I think that right now in lockdown, that's particularly interesting.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Were there any particular examples out of that that you could talk about?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>Yes, absolutely. So we had one group in the first year, they created soft robotics in the form of - almost looks like a hand sized tentacles, and you can put them anywhere on your body. And when you squeeze the controller, it blew air into the tentacles, and they curled around the body. So you could create this, you could put this on anyone's body and then manipulate. it was really interesting. Another group have made what I called a sensual shawl. And they call the sex blanket, which was a short piece of fabric with some sensors in it. And when you wrapped it around your body, the sensors were next to your skin. Then when you were in a virtual or an augmented reality scene, where perhaps you had rose petals falling from the ceiling, you would feel those trigger the sensors. And as it was as if you were actually experiencing the rose petals touching you.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>That sounds amazing.</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>We had a one that was a series of inflatable tubes that you could wrap around yourself. And if you flick the switch on a motor, they would inflate, and it was like being squeezed and hugged.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Wow, so innovative. In terms of the industry, what do you think would have to change for more experimental products and approaches like that to take hold?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>It's quite difficult with sex tech to get funding for projects. A lot of venture capitalists won't touch anything that has sort of adult content. So if it involves sex, or gambling or drink, things like that, they don't want to get involved quite often. So it's still seen as being very taboo in terms of funding. And there's been a lot of sexism in it as well. The Consumer Electronics Show last year awarded an innovation prize to a robotic vibrator company, but then wouldn't let them exhibit in the trade show. And yet, we're quite happy to have a sex robot being shown on stage. So it's a double standard of what's allowed; a sex toy for women was deemed not nice enough to have on the stage, whereas the sex robot was seen as being fun and interesting.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>We've spoken about the male gaze. I'm assuming it's an industry that's quite dominated by men. Is that a fair assumption?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>Certainly with sex robots, it reflects the state of play in Silicon Valley, which is its its tech being designed by men, for men. We see this in every bit of tech that comes out of there. We see it in the fact that all voice assistants began with female voices because men like to tell women what to do. We see it in the fact that when Apple released a health tracker, there's no way of tracking menstruation on it. It's just incredible. Even in a business sense, it's ridiculous - because you're excluding half the world from your market.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>You mentioned about that double standard when we're talking about sex tech. Does looking at the approach to sex tech, as well as maybe misunderstandings about it, as well as sexism within the industry - has that led you to think about how narrow minded we can be about sex itself?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>There's still so much to do around sex. Certainly, in the past few years we see a resurgence in more moralistic views, more right wing views, that are pushing against the idea of sexual freedom. Certainly, in the US, you can see this in terms of fights over abortion and women's bodily autonomy, things that restricted sex workers being able to use the internet for work. And that's quite worrying. in other ways, we like to think we're very open. And we like to think that we're very broad minded. But there's still a lot of social judgment around these kind of things. Interestingly, with lockdown, people are starting to turn to tech for solutions around sex and around intimacy. So perhaps that will be liberating in some ways.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And if different kinds of desire were taken into account, so you know, female desire, queer desire, what might that lead to? What's different about different kinds of desire, that's not sort of getting a look in within the industry?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>At the moment, it's very much a very much a heteronormative, mono-heteronormative environment. I think there are quite a few startups now that are pushing against that. So you getting more sex tech, that will be better for people with disabilities, for queer communities, for people with multiple partners. And that's really, really promising to see. I just hope that they're able to get momentum and get going with that. Certainly, the will is there, the intention is there. It's whether or not it can be delivered in this society.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>When we're talking about this intersection of intimacy and technology, what kind of future would you like to see?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>I would love to see a future where people have companionship needs met and their intimacy needs met, but not one that replaces humans, because I don't think we should aim for that. I don't think we will get that anyway. But something where life becomes more pleasurable for people who may be missing out, or it becomes more convenient for people when they're apart from their loved ones. I'd like to see technology mediating human relationships, I'd like to see it enhancing what we have, and making things better. I am a techno optimist. I'm not saying that there are no flaws with technology, I can list many, many, many flaws with technology. And you know, I do work in a lot of work in AI ethics, and I get very concerned about some of the directions that these things go. But overall, I think that technology does have the power to enhance lives. And I'd really like to see it go in that direction.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>To put you on the spot, what would you invent, if you could in this space?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>At the moment, I think it would be really lovely to have a machine that could just cuddle you and make you feel reassured, that would be able to give you a bit of a hug when you're away from your loved ones, and maybe whisper in your ear and tell you everything's going to be okay.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>So in this series, we've been looking to the <em>New Humanist</em>'s huge archive of writing on science, culture and ideas to find pieces that might appeal to our guests. And today, we thought we'd take a quick look at "The Dawn of the Replicant", which is an article from 2016, in which Will Wiles considers advances in robot design. Kate, Will writes about the robot revolt trope, which is often seen in pop culture. So that's this idea that the robots might rise up and turn against us. You've seen your fair share of robots, probably more than most people. Is that something to be genuinely concerned about? Or is it firmly in the realm of fiction?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>We certainly don't have to worry about the robot revolution just yet. I would say out of all the problems that tech is bringing us, in all the threats to humanity, that's one of the further away threats. There's definitely a very long standing trope of this. It's where we get the word robot from, from chap x play, where the the robots were servants who threw off the shackles, and we see it time and time again in science fiction, but that's not the big problem in tech with technology. So we're pretty safe.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Will also mention this question of the kinds of jobs that might be filled by robots. So for in care and domestic work, for example, do you think with COVID-19, we may be being shown that robots can and should do such jobs? Or has in fact shown that the human touch remains vital?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>The problem is we don't have enough human touch. We don't have enough human care workers. And a lot of countries are adopting a strategy where robotics could help out but it's not about building humanoid robotic carers, because that's just not technologically feasible. It's very computationally and financially expensive. So Japan, for example, has a robot strategy that kind of hinges on the idea of things that are assistive, like exoskeletons that could help carers lift people, or special powered wheelchairs that can get people around. So there's definitely space for that. Interestingly, people are fine. Actually, people are generally okay with the idea of putting care robots at work in things like nursing homes, but they are really not happy with the idea of robots looking after their children. So survey after survey, you hear people going, "well, you know, I'm okay with it for all people, but I don't want them near my babies", which I think it's very telling about how we treat our elderly people. There are actually trials in care homes and nursing homes with robotic therapy pets, for example. And companionship robots, they've actually been quite successful. And anecdotally, the the people in the care homes are pretty positive about them and find it to be quite a good thing. But you do get kick back from others going, "wow, that's just no replacement, we're destroying human contact", but we can have it as well as human contact. We're spread a bit thin when it comes to caring. So I'd like to think that technology can help.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>So finally, Will's piece, in common with your book <em>Turned On</em> includes lots and lots of pop culture references. So we've got <em>The Stepford Wives</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em>, and <em>Ex-Machina</em>, and so on. Can you think of a piece of TV or a film or a book that you think gives a progressive vision of the future and sex tech in particular, and robotics?</p> <p><strong>KD: </strong></p> <p>Oh, well,if we had if we had a nice TV program, it wouldn't get as many viewers we everyone loves a dystopian sci fi. So things like <em>Black Mirror</em> are really interesting, because they're so near future that some of the technology is quite feasible. But of course, it goes wrong, because where's the fun if it doesn't? I actually think that some of the <em>Black Mirror</em> ideas are really interesting, including cobbling together your loved one from their leftover social media posts. I think that's fascinating. It's not that far off from what we could do, given the amount of data that is collected about us and given the amount of footprint we leave. So would that be a good thing? I don't know. There's something to be said for hanging on to the memories digitally of your loved ones. But then again, does that impact on how we grieve, and how we move on in the world? I don't know that there's a particularly happy portrayal of where we might go in the future. But there's definitely interesting ones. And with the dystopian ones, there's definitely paths we don't want to go down.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Thanks so much. That was fascinating. Kate Devlin, author of <em>Turned On: Science, Sex, and Robots</em>. Niki, there's loads to take in there. What are the main things that you'd want to take away from our chat with Kate?</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>I guess I was confronted by my own assumptions, because I hadn't really thought about it. I think at some level, I had associated owning a sex doll with denigrating women in real life. And the fact that Kate overturned that assumption, made me think of the association that people make between playing violent video games and thinking that will automatically lead kids and teenagers to act out that violence in real life. So those are just,I guess, knee jerk reactions that don't necessarily hold water in reality.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I agree. I think I shared that assumption, and hadn't really ever interrogated it, this idea that there's an association with denigrating women in some way. And I was, on a similar note really struck by what Kate said about lots of people who own these dolls, not seeing them as being primarily or certainly not solely about sex, and that it can be about intimacy, and about companionship, which certainly isn't something that I would have associated with this kind of technology. But I thought that was really fascinating.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, and I guess it's also about what kind of role that we assume there'll be used for, and also, not talking about sex robots, but talking about robot carers. And she mentioned that people like general population are more much more likely to accept a robot carer for older people, and for the elderly, than they are for children. Kate actually said that, for her that seemed to speak to the way that our current society prioritizes children, vastly over the elderly. I think that there's maybe something that's true about that. I don't know what you think.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>It's interesting, I guess there could also be a moral element. And the idea that children growing up are being taught a moral code. So it's not just functional care that they need. They also need to learn about the world and the way life is, whereas elderly people have a whole lifetime of experience and knowledge and wisdom and so on. And what they need is a more functional companionship, I suppose. And practical help. So yes, it's obviously a complicated issue. But listening to Kate talk, it seems that maybe robots could be more appropriate for elderly care than something like teaching children.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, it does seem that Kate's book challenges a lot of assumptions and it's definitely worth a read.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Well, that's all for today. Next up, we'll be talking to Jon Dean, who has written a book on charity - an area rather like sex tech, perhaps, where what people claim to believe might sometimes be pretty different from what they actually do.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Remember, you can head to newhumanist.org.uk/withreason to read more about the podcast and find reading lists and transcripts for each episode.

This is the podcast from New Humanist magazine and the Rationalist Association, the podcast where you can find radical, exciting and sometimes surprising research and ideas from thinkers who deserve to be heard. But challenged a bit too, of course,</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>It's the place where you'll find intelligent thinking in turbulent times. In this series, we're meeting writers and academics whose work prompts questions like: How should we listen to people whose ideas differ from our own? What happens when we cast a critical eye over dominant notions of knowledge? And what could the future of everything from work to relationships look like in this time of massive technological change?</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>We're concerned with questions of reason and unreason, religion and secularism, rational debate and ideas. Our guests this series include people like the feminist Minna Salami, who celebrates sensuous ways of knowing in her new book, responding to Euro-patriarchal knowledge. And Kate Devlin, an expert in sex robots who sifts the facts from the moral panic on the subject. But today, we're meeting an anthropologist of religion.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Yes, our guest today is Joseph Webster. And as I see it, Joe looks at faith and religion in the real world in practice. And what I like about his writing really is that it refuses to bow to cliche or sensationalism. I think there's a real humanity to his descriptions of the people that he studies. He really takes their world seriously, which I think is something that often researchers anthropologists might claim to do, but don't always fully do. I think sometimes journalists are guilty of that also, he's interested in things like apocalypse. So he wrote about people who believe they're living in the end times a very fashionable phrase in 2020, long before the recent rash of books on bunkering and prepping that we've seen this year, especially. More broadly, he studies the rather less trendy subject of Protestantism, how it's actually lived, sometimes in what we might call rather extreme forms.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yes, so Joe's first book was based on his time spent with a devout fishing community in northern Scotland. And for his latest work, he stayed in Scotland and studied quite a different group, the Orange Order, which is Scotland's largest Protestant only fraternity.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Yep, so that's pretty different from the stereotype of anthropology, which you might think of as people going far away to study cockfights in Bali, sexuality in Samoa, the supposedly exotic if you like. So when we talk to Joe, earlier this year, we started by asking why he chosen to stay a little bit closer to home, and whether that was an ethical, conscious decision for him.</p> <p><strong>Joseph Webster: </strong></p> <p>I think it's a conscious decision insofar as the phenomena that I'm interested in happens to be closer to home. So I study Protestant fundamentalism mostly in Scotland. But the interesting observation to make from that, I suppose, is that whilst anthropologists do tend to be drawn towards exotic tribes, for want of a better phrase, it's important to realize that the type of exoticism that we associate with anthropology can actually be found much closer to home. So we imagine that faraway places are exotic and our own culture is somehow banal. But actually, the things that we imagined to be the most ordinary and the closest to home can actually present itself as highly exotic depending on your perspective.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And lots of us probably assume that we basically know what Protestantism is, but could you briefly talk us through its main ideas and pillars?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>So the core principle of Protestantism, I suppose, would be defense of the legacy of the reformation, the Protestant Reformation, which is itself defined by a very particular interpretation of the Bible and seeing biblical authority as the sole authority of faith, that would be an important hallmark. Other features are clearly established in opposition to Catholicism. So the refusal of the mediatory role of priests, the concern about not worshipping images, as certain Protestants would express it - so statues of Mary for instance, not praying to Mary, not allowing a priest to be an intermediary in the confession of sin. So, whilst Protestants say, all we do is follow the Bible, in practice, what that looks like is often the creation of a number of different practices, which take their cue in a negative sense from Catholicism. So for instance, many Catholics would routinely take the mass every single week whereas the Protestant church that I study tend to take communion, sometimes as few as two or three times a year. So you get the idea that, yes, Protestantism is positively defined by a particular relationship to the Bible, but it's also negatively defined in terms of how it isn't a certain expression of religiosity that we would typically associate with Catholicism.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And you yourself have a Protestant commitment. Is that right?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Yeah. So I was raised in the Church of England, a kind of moderate Church of England background and having moved to Ireland, I joined a Presbyterian Church - although, I suppose what drew me to the radical apocalyptic and fundamentalist groups that I researched is that they existed as an expression of Protestantism that was so utterly different to my own Church of England upbringing,</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Much of your work is on Protestantism, and how it's defined by believers themselves and what it means to them to be a good Protestant. And we'll talk more about that in a moment when we talk about your book on Orange politics. But first, tell us a bit about your earlier work, for which you spent a lot of time studying a Protestant brethren fishing community in North Eastern Scotland, where people believed they were living in the last of the last days.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, so my first book was an ethnographic study of a very small fishing village in the far northeast of Scotland called Gamrie. The village had 700 people and six churches, many of these churches were part of the Brethren movement, which is defined by its eschatology - that means its theology of the end of the world. And they were urgently anticipating the apocalypse. And what that looked like in practice was a very close attention to current affairs happenings in the news, but also local developments in the fishing industry, because they were all fishermen, and trying to draw straight lines often between what they read in the Bible and their own everyday experience. And it was that sign searching, that looking for signs of the end times, that came to define what it meant to be a good Brethren believer in that particular community. And they were often, from an outside perspective, quite unusual expressions of that. So because they were all fishermen, they regarded the European Union, and particularly the Common Fisheries Policy as the "mark of the beast" and the Antichrist. So drawing straight lines between political institutions, and particular end times beliefs was something which really seized the religious imagination of local people in that community.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And that research gave rise to your more recent work on the Orange Order in Scotland. That's a very different culture, but still one that's defined as Protestant. And members, the way they see themselves is that they're defending civil and religious liberties. But the order is also accused of being sectarian or even supremacist. Could you tell us a bit about its roots?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Okay, so very briefly, the Orange Order celebrate their own roots through William III, Prince of Orange and the conflict that he had with James II. So James II was a Roman Catholic King, and the Protestant establishment within Britain at the time was very anxious that James II's Catholic commitments could lead to the royal lineage falling into Catholic hands permanently. And as a result, they invited William III, to essentially invade. And that's exactly what he did, in 1688 William lands in Torbay, and by 1690, William III defeats James and is enthroned as King along with his wife Queen Mary. Fast forward 100 years and in Ireland, you have a series of laws which have been designed to secure Protestant ascendancy. So to prevent a kind of second rise of institutional Catholicism within Ireland, and unsurprisingly, the Irish community in Ireland felt aggrieved by these laws, and were fighting back. And the Orange Order as we know it today, is essentially a Masonic inspired secret society, which was attempting to shore up and protect these Irish penal laws. So they attempted to secure Protestant ascendancy. And of course it looks very different today, but its historical roots are designed to secure Protestant ascendancy through this sectarian Civil Defence Force that we saw arise in the very late 1700s.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And so this this started in Ireland, Joe, but came over to Scotland. You write about how it was brought over, I think by soldiers, then weavers, then those fleeing famine and so on. Today it's known for, or at least associated with, in part, sectarian football chants, support for Rangers football club, ritual, anti Catholicism, links to Ulster unionism in Ireland and of course, parades, which are often in the media, though many of them were canceled this year due to COVID-19. And you studied the Order for five years - going to archives, social clubs, churches, everywhere. And where does Scots Orangeism happen today? What does it look like? It seems it's quite hard to pin down.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Well, I think it's very diverse, which is the first thing to say and whilst the public encounter Scots Orangeism primarily on the streets during the summer months of June and July, when they parade through Scotland's urban centres, particularly in Glasgow, which is where they're most well known, the life of the Orangemen is much more diverse than just parading on a few days of the year. Indeed, it's tied up with private lodge activities and rituals. So because the Orange Order has some institutional similarities with Freemasonry, you know, you can use your judgment there about what an Orange meeting might look like, in terms of the reenactment of certain biblical passages in this dramatic communal fashion. But also much more mundane activities, like meeting at your local Orange social club, and drinking together and swapping stories and joking and gossiping and watching football matches, all of that then comes to make life in the Order what it is. And of course, the other very time consuming activity that many Orangemen were engaging in during my research was campaigning against Scottish independence. So as well as the ritual side of things, there is this informal social fraternity - but there's also really concerted grassroots political activism. And if you combine all of those ingredients, then I think you get a pretty rounded picture of what life in the Order looks like.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think that's what your book offers as well. And you talk there also about the different sides to Orange culture. So you describe I think watching a parade, for example, where there's a chaplain, who's really earnestly talking to you about spiritualism, and all these important matters, while two topless men nearby, draped in loyalist flags are smoking joints, getting drunk, etc. I guess you use that as an example, to capture this sense of how heterogenous the culture is, you talk about the rank and file versus a respectable hierarchy, so to speak. Tell me about that, that breadth of membership or type of follower or person?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Sure. So I think the first thing to point out there is the way in which there is a strong divide between the hierarchy, who regard themselves as eminently respectable defenders of a liberal Protestant tradition. But in contrast to that you have grassroots members, who are suspicious of the non-sectarian claims that the hierarchy want to put forward to the rest of the world. So the hierarchy want the grassroots members to be more respectable, but the grassroots members often - certainly among the men that I spent time among - were skeptical about whether or not the squeaky clean image of Orangeism that the hierarchy wanted to put forward was, in fact, their own Orangeism and whether it was the true version of Orangeism that they valued and experienced. Things get even more messy when you realize that in addition to fully paid up orange members, you also have a much wider circle of Orange supporters. So they're not themselves members, but they are regarded, at least in some contexts by Orange members as what they call loyal Protestant friends. But in other contexts, depending on the behavior in question, they're regarded as less desirable, and that would draw in football supporters and other loyalist groups as well.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And indeed, I mean, there is this side that we can't ignore isn't there, and that you also don't ignore in your books. You write about a girl struck by a stray bottle during the Order's campaign against Scottish independence. And in the past few years, Glasgow has seen incidents around parades and so on. I think an attack on a Catholic priest by a follower of a parade in 2018. I guess this is the kind of thing we're talking about here.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>That's right. And the Orange hierarchy are right in pointing out that those who are guilty of the most egregious sectarian behavior are often those at the fringes of Orange parades who are themselves not members. And they say, look, we can't control the behaviour of those who haven't signed up to our organization, but happened just to be standing at the edge of one of our parades. The wider debate that gets played out endlessly in the press then is, do Orange parades create an atmosphere, which is conducive to this type of sectarian behavior? And if it does, should those people be referred to as loyal Protestant friends? And answering that question is really difficult. But I suppose my job as an anthropologist, as an onlooker, was simply to point out that these multiple voices, these multiple perspectives existed side by side, but at the same time they existed in tension. The Orange hierarchy don't often agree with the grassroots members, let alone do they often agree with those at the fringes of their parade. So capturing that messiness was really important.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And I guess just staying with this for a moment, whilst it's hard to control, maybe it is, you'd hope, easy to condemn damaging behavior. This summer, we saw, for example, reports that the leader of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland had failed to immediately condemn sometimes violent protesters from from loyalists' splinter groups from the far right, essentially, who were ostensibly defending a statue of William of Orange in Glasgow/ That strikes me as a bit of a problem, certainly disappointing.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>So the Orange Order hierarchy are put in a difficult position as those types of events get played out very quickly in the press. And when that statement was made, my understanding is that it wasn't really clear, who was attending those demonstrations and what they were doing. But certainly, the hierarchy have to tread a very difficult line about condemning those who are indeed proven to have behaved illegally, like, for instance, they did with the case of the girl who was struck in the face by that bottle or the parade spectator who spat on the the Catholic priest, you mentioned both of those cases. And in those cases, the Orange hierarchy immediately condemned those actions. What we saw most recently in Glasgow, George Square around these protests was a developing situation where no one was really clear who was protesting and who wasn't. But I agree with you that it probably would have been prudent for the hierarchy to more vocally distance themselves from those protesters. But it's easy for me to say that talking to you in an interview, and it would be harder, I imagine, to make that type of judgment call, as you see events developing before you.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>So you're saying that not everyone associated with the Order engages in violence, and also that not everyone who behaves badly in these incidents is actually a member. But yeah, I think, speaking for myself, I might think twice about joining or staying in an organization where some members have engaged in that kind of behavior or in such sectarian language. So I wondered what you think about those kinds of decisions?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, that's a that's a good question. I think there are some Orangemen who do feel very uncomfortable with the kind of outer edges of sectarian behavior that get reported in the press. And for those members. I think if they decide to stay within the organization, what they're doing is they are explaining those events to themselves as highly fringe events, which don't represent the truth of the organization which they've joined. But clearly for critics of the Orange Order, the debate then becomes: are those behaviors fringe or are they actually part and parcel of what it means to be involved in that type of organization? And my sense is, having spent a lot of years with grassroots Orangemen, that there is, again, a range of views. I met with and spoke with Orangemen who were very against the type of sectarian behavior and bigotry that was reported in the press, particularly around these fringe outbreaks of violence. But I also met others who in some instances, and in some circumstances relished the conflict that came with Orange parades, and looking at it from a different perspective, also relish the conflict around Celtic and Rangers in the the old firm football derby. So there's a diversity of opinion there within the Orange Order. And my sense is that whilst some condemn it, others quite like it. And I imagine you would find the same across any number of different organizations which finds itself particularly on the right of the political spectrum.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>So Scots Orangemen are active in opposing Scottish independence, as you've mentioned, seeking to preserve the UK and so on. And I think you met one member who was also a member of the SNP, which is quite interesting. But they're also vigilant against what you discuss, as the menace of Rome, something stretching back to William of Orange. You give examples of how Orangeman see the threats of Catholicism, as they regard it in the everyday, whether it's weeds growing over some neglected Memorial, or whether it's macro issues and education policy. I think it's really interesting that you avoid using the term "conspiracy theory", which is again, a term really thrown around today. Why do you choose to avoid avoid that word? That phrase?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>I guess the term "conspiracy theory" is often a shorthand for a farcical and ridiculous story that no one in their right mind would believe. If we use the word conspiracy theory, often what we're doing is, we're buying into the highly loaded terminology and assumptions that that come with that term. "People who are conspiracy theorists don't believe in the moon landing" would be a kind of classic example of that. Whereas if we use different terms like occluded agency or hidden agency, then suddenly the conversation is able to compare itself to other phenomena. So, you know, maybe it's not a conspiracy theory to suggest that there are financial interests holding back the fight against climate change, maybe some people do profit from fossil fuel industries. And if that's the case, then maybe they are holding back progress on certain technologies, which would allow us to pump less carbon into the atmosphere. I don't think many people would regard that as a conspiracy theory. So if that's the case, then again, maybe we shouldn't use the term for some descriptions of occluded agency and should use it for others. Instead, maybe we should try and find a form of language which allows these cases to be compared and contrasted in slightly more value neutral ways.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>You're listening to With Reason with me, Alice Bloch.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>And me, Samira Shackle. And today we're joined by the anthropologist JW:, who's talking to us about his study of the Orange Order in Scotland. If you'd like to read about matters of reason, belief, community, and much more, why not subscribe to New Humanist magazine? Just like this podcast, it's published by the Rationalist Association. It's a quarterly magazine full of original reporting and fresh thinking on religion, secularism, philosophy, conflict, and much more. I'm the editor, but don't take my word for it, head to newhumanist.org.uk/subscribe, and use the code WITHREASON to get a whole year of issues for just &pound;13.50. So far, we've heard from Joe about the roots of the Orange Order in Scotland, its membership and its followers. We've also talked about how Joe avoids using the term conspiracy theory to describe some of these men's views on volunteerism.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, one thing that did really strike me reading Joe's book was that some of the men he spoke to openly describe themselves as bigots. There's a moment where one man is talking about a singer who performed locally, and he basically says, "Well, yeah, he's a good singer, but he's not so good at the bigotry". Joe talks about hate as being part of "the good" for these men, as something that brings fraternity. Really, that could sound quite contentious on the first listen. And so I asked Joe, what he means by that, by this idea that hate is part of "the good" for them.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>So I think what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to push our understanding of what we allow ourselves to include within "the good" in order to better understand what being an Orangeman in some circumstances is about. So if we say that hate is part of "the good", what we mean is that for some people in some contexts, showing hatred to an institution, or in some cases, a group of people, is capable of giving their lives value and meaning in a way that they regard to be ethical and moral. Perhaps we could take a step back and and ask ourselves the question: do we think that most people engage in behaviors, because they think that those behaviors are good? And I think the answer is probably yes. I don't know many people who do what they do with the determined and settled view that their behaviors are bad. So if the Orange Order across the board thinks that what they're doing is a good thing, then as an anthropologist, my job is to make that make sense to me. And make it make sense to my readers. And I try and do that in the book by framing hatred as a key constituent of fraternity, and also a key constituent of love. So you're only capable of loving what you love. Because on the flip side, you also hate what you hate, and trying to allow love and hatred and fraternity and exclusionism, not to be separate categories, but to actually be kind of conjoined parts of human experiences, is what I try and present in the analysis.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And so you're not saying that hate is good. You're not making a normative claim at all. You're saying it's part of "the good" for these men, it's part of their ethical world. I think one point you've made, either in the book or elsewhere, is the fact that if we look at, say, offensive behavior around football matches, well, yes, that happens at football matches, but it also happens on the bus home. So there has to be something else going on there in the performance of hatreds, when it's in a kind of closed group, if you like. In that instance, it's not about offending the other - something else is going on.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, that's right. So if you look at football, chanting, the vast majority of the most strongly sectarian expressions of hatred are offered in the absence of rival fans. So expressing hatred towards an absent other, in that context becomes a key way of expressing your love for your own football team. So chanting about hatred for Celtic, when there's no Celtic fans around, de facto becomes an expression of your love for Rangers. Now, clearly, those expressions can then be recorded and enter different contexts. And the effect then becomes very different. So these events are not hermetically sealed in experience, even if, as they are engaged and the people who are doing those chants, experience them as entirely separate from a different context. So remaining sensitive to what the original motivations were of the people engaging in that type of sectarian chanting is important to better understand why they're doing those things and why they think doing those things is good and right and proper.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>So do you want to make a point about what you call exceptionalism?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>So when I write about exceptionalism in the book, what I'm trying to put my finger on is the way in which the Orange Order regard themselves to be special, they talk about being a chosen few; in some situations, they talk about themselves as being a race apart, and like my analysis of the relationship between love and hate, my framing of exceptionalism or being part of a special group tries to understand what it feels like to be special in negative relation to the group who is being distanced from, or in some cases condemned. So being exceptional for the Orange Order, I think means that not only are they a kind of special and chosen race, but that they are also not part of the group who they regard as problematic. In this case, we'd be talking about Catholics or Irish Republicans. So being exceptional means being a pristine and especially worthwhile human being, but all the time experiencing that claim in negative relation to the group of people who you regard as as disloyal, or as somehow morally worth lesser than your own community.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And Joe, through what we've been talking about today, and through your book, you make it clear that you're not seeking to sympathize with your informants necessarily but to empathize as a as an academic, and that you're seeking to learn from them, take their life seriously, but not to adopt or agree or agree with their views. But I do wonder, Joe, whether such groups are often let off the hook a little bit too easily. I'm thinking of how far right engagement, particularly by men - and I'm asking this question in a broader sense than just talking about the Orange Order and those who follow them - is often explained away with discussions about emasculation, deindustrialization disenfranchisement. Why should researchers do people the service of theorizing that self-declared bigotry, when I guess those people might not express the same generosity towards others.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>So my job as an anthropologist is certainly not to let anyone off the hook. I think what I'm trying to do is to understand why Orangemen do what they do, from their own, from their own perspective, from their own value system, and then to allow others to read what I've written and come to their own conclusions to make their own assessments. So yes, there's a wider context - whether it's how masculinity has been changed by industrial capitalism, or how indeed, industrial capitalism changes the relationships between the working class and those who are much more privileged. But that context is not enough to fully encapsulate and understand why and how people are doing what they're doing. And as a result, I'm still very much leaving open the possibility that having understood a behavior, someone might then still come to the conclusion that that behavior is is not morally worthwhile, even if the person who is engaging in it thinks that it is. But I think the important work as an anthropologist is to present how from an internal viewpoint, that behavior that we thought might be just blanket immoral, might be more complex than we initially thought it was.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Okay, so your book is also really about anthropology and research ethics - so how we approach communities and belief systems that are different from our own. And in studying the Orange Order, you use this idea of verstehen, developed by the sociologist Max Weber. And it's about getting a deep understanding of people's worlds, from their point of view. And it seems that you're saying that to do this properly, takes more work than people realize, and is also something that we can maybe be disingenuous about.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think so. Understanding something from someone's point of view, requires a lot of work, because I think it requires you to be open to the fact that the thing that you thought you understood initially, is actually not what's really going on at all. So remaining open to being wrong. And having your mind changed by the people who you are studying is really crucial to the work that I do. But that's particularly costly when you are spending time with a group like the Orange Order, whose members on occasion, represent a type of morality that many people would find distasteful. So being willing to have your mind changed on the fundamentals of what is good, and what isn't, or how we might even define "the good" is what I'm trying to do in in the book and not pursuing verstehen with that level of effort, I think will simply produce your previously held understanding, with additional justification. You will come to the conclusion that you were right all along. But that having examined it, you've ended up disproving the viewpoint of the local people who you researched. That seems to me not quite good enough. Listening to people to the extent that they are able to teach you and in some cases rebuke you is really what good anthropology looks like.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>So in discussing this idea of open mindedness, essentially, you mentioned a talk called Anti-Antirelativism, given by the anthropologist Clifford Geertz in the 1980s. Tell me a bit about that, and what you think we can learn from it. I think it ends with this really nice phrase, "if we wanted home truths, we should have stayed at home".</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I mean, it's a very famous anthropological essay. And I guess my reason for weaving that into my own work is that Geertz's main concern is to take issue with the development in anthropology. When he was writing that essay about challenges to classic anthropological views of relativism, the idea that particularly cultural relativism is an important cornerstone of how anthropologists think and how they do their work. And that was a new version of the biological theorization being developed. When he was writing that essay, which was really challenging relativists 'assumptions, a version of this anthropology later became militant anthropology: the idea that we should strongly advocate for our informants, that we should study the underdog, that we should contend for what we regard to be their well-being, that we should defend their rights. And therefore, that activist version of anthropology really doesn't allow relativism to exist. And Geertz was concerned about that. And he suggested that there was something worrying about that militant version of anthropology, which was very against relativism. And he wasn't necessarily defending all of the excesses, as people see it, of relativism. He was just more concerned about the way in which relativism was being challenged. And what he saw as being lost, I think, in anthropology was this willingness to listen to everyone, and to potentially learn from everyone, rather than to pick and choose particular voices as worthy of listening to and shutting down others, because they don't potentially fit in with a wider political project of progressive liberal tolerance.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And it does seem like a lot of the work you do is rather exhausting in a way. It seems like quite a tough gig researching the Orange Order for five years. Not least in the age of the Scottish independence referendum, the Brexit vote, you've picked probably the hardest period in which to study this in recent times. What's next for you? Do you fancy a change of scene maybe, you know, anthropology far away, as we were talking about at the beginning?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>I still think that, for me, staying closer to home is where where I want to be, not least because it's still, I think, an outlier within anthropology. But because I guess staying closer to home to return to what you were quoting from Geertz. You know, staying closer to home doesn't necessarily only produce home truths, right. It doesn't just lead us to reproducing common sense assumptions. I think that the groups, the people that I'm interested in, are still capable of pushing back on what we regard to be unchallengeable or obvious, so called home truths. I enjoyed my time with the Orange Order, I learned a lot, I certainly had to rethink and redefine what I thought Protestantism was. But I think what I would like to do next is return to some of the more explicitly apocalyptic and end times groups, particularly given that that all of a sudden, everyone is talking about apocalypticism. I would like to return to the signs of the times, type research, the idea that many religious groups are fascinated by tracing close links between current affairs and their own prophetic or apocalyptic beliefs, and to try and shine a light on that in a way that doesn't reproduce the tabloid stereotype of the religious fanatic, with the sandwich board on the street corner, declaring the end is nigh, I'd like to try and go back to that religious world and to document it and explain it in a way that didn't let people essentially pigeonhole the theme of apocalypticism as nothing but religious fanaticism.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Great. Well, I'm speaking of the end times, I guess, it's almost time to wrap up. But before you do go, just time to look at something from the New Humanist archive, something that we thought resonated a little bit with your work. We've talked quite a lot today about changing minds. And in the article, The Sleep of Reason, which was in the magazine in 2019, Eleanor Gordon Smith writes about her research into people who do just that - people change their minds on really quite significant things. As part of that she takes on this assumption that emotion has no place in rational thinking, and that we kind of know, we think we know what rationality requires. What do you make of the piece that we write that it was something that that would probably resonate with you in your work?</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I really liked the article. I mean, I think what I found most insightful about it was the way in which Gordon Smith illustrates how what we define as rational thinking is essentially, the preserve of a fairly small number of powerful gatekeepers, who are drawing on some very specific ideas about the way that science and evidence and thinking and decision making occurs. And I like the way the article pushes back on that and says that maybe emotion, maybe even kinship, you know, family connection, are really key ways that people navigate their world. And if that's the case, then maybe we need to think about redefining how we go about the process of changing minds. So I really liked But I think one thing that it left me with was was a question mark about whether we can push the argument even further and whether we can not just question the methods of changing minds, you know, essentially to allow emotion into the room when we when we talk about and think about and try and practice rationality. But also, I don't know, I suppose I was left wondering whether there's also a space to question whether rational decision and rational debate is actually an artifice that that doesn't exist or at least doesn't exist in the way that we think it does. My sense is that Gordon Smith still held up rationality as an ideal, albeit, you know, a difficult one to achieve. And I guess I would want to push back on that and ask ourselves, perhaps it's the case that, you know, rationality is rightly clouded by the messiness of human relationships and all of the complexity that Gordon Smith points out, but But still, could we go further? And could we could we question whether or not the thing that we think is rational, is actually deeply, you know, embedded in all sorts of assumptions about, for instance, the fact that belief and ideas matter most, well, maybe that's not the case, maybe actually, you know, people don't necessarily change their minds, at least not without changing their practices and their behaviors. So those are the kinds of questions that it raised for me, but certainly, I really liked the article.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>plenty to think on there. Thank you very much, Joseph Webster.</p> <p><strong>JW: </strong></p> <p>Well, thanks for talking with me. I really enjoyed it.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Joseph Webster there. Alice, as we said, Joe's book, the religion of orange politics is about exactly that Scots Orangeism. But it's also about that doing research itself. So it's about anthropology and ethics to what struck you most from talking to Joe?</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>First of all, for me, it was a bit of an education in Protestantism, something I think I presumed to know about in a kind of background sense, but I hadn't really stopped to think about much before. So Joe gave a really excellent potted history, or slightly more than a potted history. And I hadn't really thought before about how, of course, that word "protest" is right in there, staring us in the face, embedded within the word Protestantism, which really tells us a lot about its history.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I thought it was really fascinating to hear him talk about religious fundamentalism and extremism in the context of Protestantism, because I think when we think of Protestantism, we think of something kind of inherently moderate, that's quite familiar - if you've grown up in the UK - without necessarily knowing very much about it.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>I think what we're talking about there really is this idea of looking at the familiar or what we presume to be the familiar, the taken for granted, and taking a different view on it. I really like Joe's commitment to doing anthropology a bit closer to home than others might. This idea that actually also, we don't always get home truths when we stay at home, you know, we might find something that surprises us, or I think, to quote Joe or to paraphrase him, something that kind of teaches or even rebukes us. I think he's really saying something important there about the value of listening to people, ultimately, and the hard work that actually that takes when you really do it properly and commit to it. Something that I think is really much needed today in the UK and the post-Trump or almost post-Trump, USA. It's something I guess journalists could learn from too?</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, definitely. I think there's often a sense that journalists might go into something with a preconceived narrative, and then retrofit the material they've got to the narrative. And that's obviously not what you're supposed to do. But I think often it is what happens, perhaps given constraints of time, and pressure to get a certain kind of story and so on, but I think you can really see - obviously, it has a negative impact, I think, on the the quality of material that's produced, and also on the role of the media in terms of furthering public understanding. I think if you're fitting material and interviews to a narrative that you that you've already decided and that you want to prove, then that undermines the whole purpose. I think there's definitely something to take away from Joe's thinking on that, way beyond anthropology.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>I also really like Joe's resistance to the term conspiracy theory. And that certainly made made me think again and made me reflect on I suppose, why we label people people's beliefs with that term. You know, a lot of us might hold beliefs or harbor suspicions that we can't fully back up. And yet, we maybe are in the privileged position of not being branded as conspiracy theorists, where other people might be more more at risk of being labeled as such. And that sense of taking seriously from a scholarly perspective, other people's perspectives -and that's not to say that you have to approve of them or agree with them at all - is also really strong. Joe's early work on the fishing community in Scotland that we spoke about, that I would thoroughly recommend.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>That is all for now. Next up, we'll be talking to Kate Devlin. She's an academic who's hardly in the same field as Joe. She's written a book about sex robots. But she's just as keen to avoid sensationalism in her work.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>You can head to newhumanist.org.uk to read more about With Reason, and to find reading lists linked to each episode and transcripts of them all, too.

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="The market at Bel&eacute;m in Par&aacute; State, Brazil" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2C7M70P.jpg" alt="2C7M70P" /></p> <p>Among the colourful fruit and vegetable stalls in the historic city centre of Rio de Janeiro, customers barter with market vendors. Considered an essential public service, trading has continued throughout the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed at least 160,000 Brazilian lives since March. One stand, adorned with herbs and alternative medicines, offers something more taboo. Groups of young women form an orderly queue to ask for a remedy to cure their &ldquo;sore tummy&rdquo; &ndash; a euphemism in Brazil for an unwanted pregnancy.</p> <p>Mixed with hot water, the ch&aacute; de canela, or cinnamon tea of abortive herbs, known as emmenagogues, may induce cramps, bleeding and ultimately a miscarriage. They&rsquo;re most effective before a pregnancy reaches six weeks, one woman at the market explains. The idea of using parsley, mugwort, pennyroyal or black cohosh to manage reproductive health may seem entirely outdated in 2020. But for many of these women, the alternative to self-induced abortion is terrifying.</p> <p>In almost all circumstances, abortion is a crime in Brazil. This may come as a surprise to those accustomed to the sunnier image projected by the South American country of beach bodies, carnival parades and sexual promiscuity, where the prevailing political mode is liberal conservatism. But Brazil has a long history of secrecy and hypocrisy when it comes to abortion. While the Roman Catholic Church remains influential, evangelical Christianity is also on the rise. Terminations are only legal if the woman&rsquo;s life is at risk, if she can prove in court she was raped, or if the foetus has anencephaly &ndash; a rare condition where part of the brain or skull is missing.</p> <p>Since the election of Jair Messias Bolsonaro in 2018, abortion in Brazil has carried even more stigma, while safe procedures are harder to access. The political climate has become sufficiently extreme that in August this year, supporters of the president protested outside a hospital where a ten-year-old girl was due to have an abortion. The child had become pregnant after being repeatedly raped by her uncle. The case obviously fulfilled the legal exemptions for abortion, and a court order had granted the child permission to terminate the pregnancy. But the protesters were undeterred, branding hospital staff &ldquo;killers&rdquo; and trying to storm the building before being dispersed by police.</p> <p>A firebrand former army captain, Bolsonaro &ndash; whose middle name means &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; in Portuguese &ndash; has significant support from Brazil&rsquo;s evangelical Christians. While he is still an avowed Catholic, he was baptised live on television by a prominent leader of the Pentecostal church in the run-up to his election.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, Christian evangelism has been gaining influence in Brazil. Estimates suggest that 28 per cent of Brazilians now consider themselves to be evangelical. Some 93 of the 513 lower house representatives in Bolsonaro&rsquo;s parliament are aligned with evangelical churches &ndash; a number that is expected to climb higher in the next round of local elections.</p> <p>Evangelicals are playing a key role in imposing regressive law changes, including seeking to restrict access to abortion by trying to block legal abortions in the case of rape, reducing funding for paediatric general clinics that attend to mothers and children, and changing the way sex education is taught in schools. Bolsonaro&rsquo;s son, Eduardo, a prominent member of the Brazilian congress, suggested as part of a televised campaign that if young people wanted to curb unwanted pregnancies, they should abstain from sex.</p> <p>According to a recent study conducted by the non-profit group Article 19, only 42 public hospitals are currently performing legal abortions, in a country of roughly 210 million people. In 2019, the year Bolsonaro assumed office, it was almost double that. As women are forced to turn to other measures, emergency contraception and cramping pills like misoprostol, better known by the brand name Cytotec, are routinely confiscated by customs authorities.</p> <h3>* * *</h3> <p>Brazil&rsquo;s extremely restrictive abortion law dates back to 1940. But despite being a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison, it is fairly common for women to seek out illegal abortions, and very rare for them to serve jail time for doing so.</p> <p>Data from the National Abortion Survey for 2016 showed that roughly half a million women have abortions in Brazil every year. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s almost one woman per minute,&rdquo; pro-choice lawyer Gabriela Rondon calculates. Of these, half needed to go to hospital to finish an incomplete abortion &ndash; in other words, 250,000 women were hospitalised after having illegal procedures.</p> <p>Relatively safe, albeit clandestine, abortions have traditionally been available to those who can afford them. But since Bolsonaro&rsquo;s election, it&rsquo;s also becoming harder to access these clandestine clinics or to treat complications that might result from unsafe procedures.</p> <p>Juliana Reis, a filmmaker and women&rsquo;s rights advocate, explains that many clinics are closing due to &ldquo;a culture of denouncing doctors&rdquo;. If someone reports a doctor for working in this space, they could lose their medical license. The impact of this, Reis says, is that &ldquo;there are fewer facilities that perform abortions, the price of a procedure goes up, and many more women are entirely excluded from a fairly safe place to turn to.&rdquo;</p> <p>Carolina Viera, 29 (not her real name), a public relations employee, paid the equivalent of &pound;800 to a private doctor in S&atilde;o Paulo. This would be prohibitive for most Brazilians who earn, on average, less than &pound;370 per month.</p> <p>The doctor bungled the procedure, and she needed emergency treatment. But she couldn&rsquo;t even bring herself to tell her own mother. &ldquo;They call him a &lsquo;classic&rsquo; for this sort of thing because women have been going to that specific gynaecologist for generations,&rdquo; said Viera. She didn&rsquo;t want to denounce him as she said he helped dozens of upper-class women in her city every day. She personally knows ten clients he&rsquo;s seen in the past.</p> <p>&ldquo;Taking money out of the ATM in instalments makes you feel dirty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have the right to choose when I want to have a child and there I was, alone, notes in hand. And I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones.&rdquo;</p> <p>Other women in her circle had been forced to travel to another city, because the nearest respected private clinic where women pay for illegal abortions had closed.</p> <p>In a country where social injustice and economic inequality are endemic, richer women have a much better chance of finding a qualified person to assist with a clandestine procedure. But as abortion gets harder to access, women are turning to increasingly dangerous methods.</p> <p>Herbs, needles inserted into the uterus and deliberately falling down staircases are common alternative methods for the less well off. Last year, Brazilian customs seized over 26,000 abortion pills coming into the country, compared with about 9,000 confiscated in 2014.</p> <h3>* * *</h3> <p>In early 2020, roughly two-thirds of all public hospital beds were taken up by women who had complications resulting from an unsafe abortion, according to health ministry data complied by NUDEM. But given that abortion is a crime, women who arrive at the emergency room in these circumstances can find it difficult to access treatment, as medical staff fear official repercussions.</p> <p>One woman, a 30-year-old from S&atilde;o Paulo, described nurses refusing to attend to her in January of this year, after a complication resulting from an illegal abortion at a health clinic. &ldquo;I was sent away from the hospital, crying in pain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve bled to death at home had I not sought help from a friend who arranged for another private gynaecologist to see me.&rdquo;</p> <p>Mariana lives in an upmarket neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro and has a seven-year-old daughter. She miscarried last year. When she arrived at her local private hospital the senior doctor refused to operate to remove the foetus and told her to wait it out at home. She bled for 40 days. &ldquo;It was the most traumatic experience of my life,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>She suspected the nurses were fearful of having their license stripped for facilitating what may have been an abortion. Had they assumed she had deliberately induced a miscarriage? &ldquo;Maternity is romanticised in Brazil,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A lot of shame is brought to women who cannot conceive a child or who are not in the right circumstances to bring one into the world.&rdquo;</p> <p>Her case shows that the stigma around abortion doesn&rsquo;t only affect women with unwanted pregnancies. The word for miscarriage in Portuguese directly places blame on any woman who is unfortunate enough to lose a child &ndash; it is called aborto espont&acirc;neo or spontaneous abortion. This is a long-running issue around miscarriage, but in recent years doctors have become even more reticent &ndash; given the increasingly inflammatory discussion around abortion since Bolsonaro&rsquo;s rise to power.</p> <h3>* * *</h3> <p>Given this climate of fear, what hope is there for change? Of the 20 countries in Latin America, only Cuba and Uruguay have legalised abortion for women in early pregnancy. This is difficult to replicate outside these smaller, more progressive nations, because of the role of religion in society and politics.</p> <p>But there is a new ray of hope in the region: Argentina. Activists there have built a broad women&rsquo;s rights movement that has drawn enthusiastic support from across the political spectrum. In November, the new president Alberto Fern&aacute;ndez put forward a legalisation bill, which is set to be debated in parliament next week. It is the ninth time that such a bill has been introduced and it has reignited fierce debate. Activists are hopeful that, with Fern&aacute;ndez as an ally, this time the bill can be pushed through. Since May, hundreds of thousands have taken to social media to stage personal demonstrations against gender violence and in support of abortion rights, with a rallying cry of &ldquo;No somos invisibles,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We are not invisible.&rdquo; Now both sides are on the streets, in Buenos Aries and elsewhere. </p> <p>In Brazil, however, the political climate is much tougher, with little space for discussion. In this context, Brazilian activists and campaigners are still trying to find ways of working around regressive legislative norms.</p> <p>Filmmaker Juliana Reis is one of these campaigners. She set up Milhas Pela Vida das Mulheres or Miles for Women&rsquo;s Lives, in September 2019. The organisation helps fund Brazilian women to travel to get abortions elsewhere in the region, in places where the law is more lenient. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s by no means a solution, but it&rsquo;s a start,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>The fact that relatively few abortion cases are taken to a higher court, and prison sentences are rare, demonstrates the degree to which Brazilian society and the judiciary understand and accept the need for the procedure. When I spoke to Dr Livia Guimar&atilde;es, a prominent women&rsquo;s rights lawyer who works for the Brazilian Society of Public Law, she highlighted 30 important abortion cases brought against women that had been taken all the way to the top court in S&atilde;o Paulo state. Five of those cases were closed on grounds of insufficient evidence and some of the victims were compensated on moral grounds. Cases being dismissed in this way echo a trend in Argentina that began a little over half a decade ago. Could this be the stirrings of progressive change in Brazil, too? At present, case numbers are small, &ldquo;but not a single woman should be held responsible for an abortion,&rdquo; Guimar&atilde;es said.</p> <h3>* * *</h3> <p>Much more needs to be done, particularly now that the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the precariousness of reproductive health services in Brazil.</p> <p>There seems to be some disagreement in parliament as to how this issue should be managed. On 1 June 2020, the Brazilian health ministry published a technical note as part of a regular public advice bulletin. It highlighted the difficulties women and girls may encounter during the coronavirus outbreak when accessing sexual and reproductive health services. Two days later, President Bolsonaro tweeted angrily about the note, distorting its contents by saying that the ministry under his watch did not support &ldquo;any proposal to legalise abortion&rdquo; (the note had made no such proposal). Two of the three public servants who were signatories were subsequently sacked.</p> <p>Funding is also drying up. Local authorities have reportedly suspended some reproductive assistance considered &ldquo;not urgent&rdquo;, including providing contraception, as the virus takes hold. This regression is a lamentable reminder of the approach the current administration is taking towards women&rsquo;s rights.</p> <p>But back in S&atilde;o Paulo there&rsquo;s an appetite for change. Bolsonaro has come under increasing scrutiny for his handling of the pandemic, and for failing to protect hundreds of thousands of lives, including those of mothers and children. The shocking case of the ten-year-old rape survivor went viral, sparking a series of lively, open debates online about the current state of abortion laws.</p> <p>Having experienced her own trauma in seeking an illegal abortion, Carolina Viera was deeply moved by the girl&rsquo;s case. &ldquo;I still burst into tears when I watch videos of the protesters trying to stop that little girl getting help,&rdquo; Viera said. But she is grateful that the story is opening people&rsquo;s eyes to the inadequate state of reproductive rights in the country: &ldquo;Brazil&rsquo;s laws are putting millions of women at risk.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2020 edition. </em><em><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>. </em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>I am delighted to launch a new series of videos that use magic to celebrate science. Fab sleight of hand artist Will Houstoun and I produced them, supported by The Royal Society of Chemistry and chemist Dr Suzanne Fergus (University of Hertfordshire). The three videos use sleight of hand techniques to celebrate a different scientist, and do not involve any CGI or camera trickery. </p>



<p>We are excited about this new story telling technique and recently conducted an experiment that showed that it significantly boosted people&#8217;s engagement (details <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://peerj.com/articles/9610/" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>

              <h2><a href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2020/10/14/how-parapsychology-changed-psychology/">How parapsychology changed psychology</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I recently co-authored a paper on how a little-known parapsychology journal was years ahead of its time.</p>



<p>Our story starts in 2011, when psychologist Daryl Bem reported several experiments that appeared to support the existence of psychic ability. Soon after, Stuart Ritchie, Chris French and I tried to replicate the studies but obtained null results. Several other academics also criticised Bem&#8217;s statistics and procedures. This type of &#8216;I have evidence for psychic ability &#8211; Oh no you don&#8217;t&#8217; back and forth has occurred many times over the years. However, this time, something odd happened.</p>



<p>Several researchers noted that the criticisms aimed at Bem’s work also applied to many studies from mainstream psychology. Many of the problems surrounded researchers changing their statistics and hypotheses after they had looked at their data, and so commentators urged researchers to submit a detailed description of their plans <strong>prior</strong> to running their studies. In 2013, psychologist Chris Chambers played a key role in getting the academic journal <em>Cortex</em>&nbsp;to adopt the procedure (known as a Registered Report), and many other journals quickly followed suit.</p>



<p>However, many academics are unaware that a little-known parapsychology journal &#8211; The European Journal of Parapsychology &#8211; implemented an early version of this concept in the 1970s. For 17&nbsp;years,&nbsp;around half of the studies in the paper were registered in advance. If the critics were right, these papers should be less likely to contain problems with their statistics and methods, and so be more likely to report spurious positive results. To find out if this was the case, I recently teamed up with Caroline Watt and Diana Kornbrot to examine the studies. The results were as expected &#8211; around 8% of the analyses from the studies that had been registered in advance were positive, compared to around 28% from the other papers. Other academics are now conducting the same sort of analyses in psychology and medicine, and finding the same pattern.</p>



<p>Academics often criticise parapsychology, but this episode is a good example of how the field is sometimes ahead of the game and can help to improve mainstream psychology. <br><br>The full paper describing this work is <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/6232/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>And Diana is now looking more broadly at openness in science. If you are a researcher with an interest in the area, you can take part in her survey <a href="https://herts.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EfYxgOn9SNkadD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>In this episode of the podcast, Sam discusses the recent social protests and civil unrest, in light of what we know about racism and police violence in America.</p>
<p>This is a transcript of a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/207-can-pull-back-brink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded podcast</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Welcome to the Making Sense podcast… This is Sam Harris.</p>
<p>OK…. Well, I’ve been trying to gather my thoughts for this podcast for more than a week—and have been unsure about whether to record it at all, frankly.</p>
<p>Conversation is the only tool we have for making progress, I firmly believe that. But many of the things we most need to talk about, seem impossible to talk about.</p>
<p>I think social media is a huge part of the problem. I’ve been saying for a few years now that, with social media, we’ve all been enrolled in a psychological experiment for which no one gave consent, and it’s not at all clear how it will turn out. And it’s still not clear how it will turn out, but it’s not looking good. It’s fairly disorienting out there. All information is becoming weaponized. All communication is becoming performative. And on the most important topics, it now seems to be fury and sanctimony and bad faith almost all the time.</p>
<p>We appear to be driving ourselves crazy. Actually, crazy. As in, incapable of coming into contact with reality, unable to distinguish fact from fiction—and then becoming totally destabilized by our own powers of imagination, and confirmation bias, and then lashing out at one other on that basis.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to talk about the current moment and the current social unrest, and its possible political implications, and other cultural developments, and suggest what it might take to pull back from the brink here. I’m going to circle in on the topics of police violence and the problem of racism, because that really is at the center of this. There is so much to talk about here, and it’s so difficult to talk about. And there is so much we don’t know. And yet, most people are behaving as though every important question was answered a long time ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching our country seem to tear itself apart for weeks now, and perhaps lay the ground for much worse to come. And I’ve been resisting the temptation to say anything of substance—not because I don’t have anything to say, but because of my perception of the danger, frankly. And if that’s the way I feel, given the pains that I’ve taken to insulate myself from those concerns, I know that almost everyone with a public platform is terrified. Journalists, and editors, and executives, and celebrities are terrified that they might take one wrong step here, and never recover.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdsmxzaHtSQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>And this is really unhealthy—not just for individuals, but for society. Because, again, all we have between us and the total breakdown of civilization is a series of successful conversations. If we can’t reason with one another, there is no path forward, other than violence. Conversation or violence.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to talk about some of the things that concern me about the current state of our communication. Unfortunately, many things are compounding our problems at the moment. We have a global pandemic which is still very much with us. And it remains to be seen how much our half-hearted lockdown, and our ineptitude in testing, and our uncoordinated reopening, and now our plunge into social protest and civil unrest will cause the Covid-19 caseload to spike. We will definitely see. As many have pointed out, the virus doesn’t care about economics or politics. It only cares that we keep breathing down each other’s necks. And we’ve certainly been doing enough of that.</p>
<p>Of course, almost no one can think about Covid-19 right now. But I’d just like to point out that many of the costs of this pandemic and the knock-on effects in the economy, and now this protest movement, many of these costs are hidden from us. In addition to killing more than 100,000 people in the US, the pandemic has been a massive opportunity cost. The ongoing implosion of the economy is imposing tangible costs, yes, but it is also a massive opportunity cost. And now this civil unrest is compounding those problems—whatever the merits of these protests may be or will be, the opportunity costs of this moment are staggering. In addition to all the tangible effects of what’s happening—the injury and death, the lost businesses, the burned buildings, the neighborhoods that won’t recover for years in many cities, the educations put on hold, and the breakdown in public trust of almost every institution—just think about all the good and important things we cannot do—cannot even <em>think</em> of doing now—and perhaps won’t contemplate doing for many years to come, because we’ll be struggling to get back to that distant paradise we once called “normal life.”</p>
<p>Of course, normal life for many millions of Americans was nothing like a paradise. The disparities in wealth and health and opportunity that we have gotten used to in this country, and that so much of our politics and ways of doing business seem to take for granted, are just unconscionable. There is no excuse for this kind of inequality in the richest country on earth. What we’re seeing now is a response to that. But it’s a confused and confusing response. Worse, it’s a response that is systematically silencing honest conversation. And this makes it dangerous.</p>
<p>This isn’t just politics and human suffering on display. It’s philosophy. It’s ideas about truth—about what it means to say that something is “true.” What we’re witnessing in our streets and online and in the impossible conversations we’re attempting to have in our private lives is a breakdown in epistemology. How does anyone figure out what’s going on in the world? What is real? If we can’t agree about what is real, or likely to be real, we will never agree about how we should live together. And the problem is, we’re stuck with one other.</p>
<p>So, what’s happening here?</p>
<p>Well, again, it’s hard to say. What is happening when <a href="https://youtu.be/viika57hTO4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a police officer or a mayor takes a knee</a> in front of a crowd of young people who have been berating him for being a cog in the machinery of systemic racism? Is this a profound moment of human bonding that transcends politics, or is it the precursor to the breakdown of society? Or is it both? It’s not entirely clear.</p>
<p>In the most concrete terms, we are experiencing widespread social unrest in response to what is widely believed to be an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at the black community by racist cops and racist policies. And this unrest has drawn a counter-response from law enforcement—much of which, ironically, is guaranteed to exacerbate the problem of police violence, both real and perceived. And many of the videos we’ve seen of the police cracking down on peaceful protesters are hideous. Some of this footage has been unbelievable. And this is one of many vicious circles that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>Again, there is so much to be confused about here. We’ve now seen endless video of police inflicting senseless violence on truly peaceful protesters, and yet we have also seen video of the police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrVp8vlQyU">standing idly by</a> while looters completely destroy businesses. What explains this? Is there a policy that led to this bizarre inversion of priorities? Are the police angry at the protesters for vilifying them, and simultaneously trying to teach society a lesson by letting crime and mayhem spread elsewhere in the city? Or is it just less risky to collide with peaceful protesters? Or is the whole spectacle itself a lie? How representative are these videos of what’s actually going on? Is there much less chaos actually occurring than is being advertised to us?</p>
<p>Again, it’s very hard to know.</p>
<p>What’s easy to know is that civil discourse has broken down. It seems to me that we’ve long been in a situation where the craziest voices on both ends of the political spectrum have been amplifying one another and threatening to produce something truly dangerous. And now I think they have. The amount of misinformation in the air—the degree to which even serious people seem to be ruled by false assumptions and non sequiturs—is just astonishing.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep in mind that, with the presidential election coming in November, the stakes are really high. As most of you know, I consider four more years of Trump to be an existential threat to our democracy. And I believe that the last two weeks have been very good for him, politically, even when everything else seemed to go very badly for him. I know the polls don’t say this. A large majority of people disapprove of his handling this crisis so far. But I think we all know now to take polls with a grain of salt. There is the very real problem of preference falsification—especially in an environment of intense social pressure. People will often say what they think is socially acceptable, and then think, or say, or do something very different in private—like when they’re alone in a voting booth.</p>
<p>Trump has presided over the complete dismantling of American influence in the world and the destruction of our economy. I know the stock market has looked good, but the stock market has become totally uncoupled from the economy. According to the stock market, the future is just as bright now as it was in January of this year, before most of us had even heard of a novel coronavirus. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. And a lot can happen in the next few months. The last two weeks feel like a decade. And my concern is that if Trump now gets to be the law-and-order President, that may be his path to re-election, if such a path exists. Of course, this crisis has revealed, yet again, how unfit he is to be President. The man couldn’t strike a credible note of reconciliation if the fate of the country depended on it—and the fate of the country has depended on it. I also think it’s possible that these protests wouldn’t be happening, but for the fact that Trump is President. Whether or not the problem of racism has gotten worse in our society, having Trump as President surely makes it seem like it has. It has been such a repudiation of the Obama presidency that, for many people, it has made it seem that white supremacy is now ascendant. So, all the more reason to get rid of Trump in November.</p>
<p>But before this social unrest, our focus was on how incompetent Trump was in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. And now he has been given a very different battle to fight. A battle against leftwing orthodoxy, which is growing more stifling by the minute, and civil unrest. If our social order frays sufficiently, restoring it will be the only thing that most people care about in November. Just think of what an act of domestic terrorism would do politically now. Things can change very, very quickly. And to all a concern for basic law and order “racist”, isn’t going to wash.</p>
<p>Trust in institutions has totally broken down. We’ve been under a very precarious quarantine for more than 3 months, which almost the entire medical profession has insisted is necessary. Doctors and public health officials have castigated people on the political Right for protesting this lockdown. People have been unable to be with their loved ones in their last hours of life. They’ve been unable to hold funerals for them. But now we have doctors and public officials by the thousands, signing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letters</a>, making public statements, saying it’s fine to stand shoulder to shoulder with others in the largest protests our nation has ever seen. The degree to which this has undermined confidence in public health messaging is hard to exaggerate. Whatever your politics, this has been just a mortifying piece of hypocrisy. Especially so, because the pandemic has been hitting the African American community hardest of all. How many people will die because of these protests? It’s a totally rational question to ask, but the question itself is taboo now.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that almost everything appears upside down at the moment.</p>
<p>Before I get into details on police violence, first let me try to close the door to a few misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the proximate cause of all this: The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. I’ll have more to say about this in a minute, but nothing I say should detract from the following observation: That <a href="https://youtu.be/vksEJR9EPQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> was absolutely sickening, and it revealed a degree of police negligence and incompetence and callousness that everyone was right to be horrified by. In particular, the actions of Derek Chauvin, the cop who kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes, his actions were so reckless and so likely to cause harm that there&#8217;s no question he should be prosecuted. And he is being prosecuted. He’s been indicted for 2nd degree murder and manslaughter, and I suspect he will spend many, many years in prison. And, this is not to say “the system is working.” It certainly seems likely that without the cell phone video, and the public outrage, Chauvin might have gotten away with it—to say nothing of the other cops with him, who are also now being prosecuted. If this is true, we clearly need a better mechanism with which to police the police.</p>
<p>So, as I said, I&#8217;ll return to this topic, because I think most people are drawing the wrong conclusions from this video, and from videos like it, but let me just echo everyone&#8217;s outrage over what happened. This is precisely the kind of police behavior that everyone should find abhorrent.</p>
<p>On the general topic of racism in America, I want to make a few similarly clear, preemptive statements:</p>
<p>Racism is still a problem in American society. No question. And slavery—which was racism’s most evil expression—was this country’s founding sin. We should also add the near-total eradication of the Native Americans to that ledger of evil. Any morally sane person who learns the details of these historical injustices finds them shocking, whatever their race. And the legacy of these crimes—crimes that were perpetrated for centuries—remains a cause for serious moral concern today. I have no doubt about this. And nothing I’m about to say, should suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>And I don’t think it’s an accident that the two groups I just mentioned, African Americans and Native Americans, suffer the worst from inequality in America today. How could the history of racial discrimination in this country not have had lasting effects, given the nature of that history? And if anything good comes out of the current crisis, it will be that we manage to find a new commitment to reducing inequality in all its dimensions. The real debate to have is about how to do this, economically and politically. But the status quo that many of us take for granted to is a betrayal of our values, whether we realize it or not. If it’s not a betrayal or your values now, it will be a betrayal of your values when you become a better person. And if you don’t manage that, it will be a betrayal of your kid’s values when they’re old enough to understand the world they are living in. The difference between being very lucky in our society, and very unlucky, should not be as enormous as it is.</p>
<p>However, the question that interests me, given what has been true of the past and is now true of the present, is what should we do next? What should we do to build a healthier society?</p>
<p>What should we do next?  Tomorrow… next week…. Obviously, I don’t have the answers. But I am very worried that many of the things we’re doing now, and seem poised to do, will only make our problems worse. And I’m especially worried that it has become so difficult to talk about this. I’m just trying to have conversations. I’m just trying to figure these things out in real time, with other people. And there is no question that conversation itself has become dangerous.</p>
<p>Think about the politics of this. Endless imagery of people burning and looting independent businesses that were struggling to survive, and seeing the owners of these businesses beaten by mobs, cannot be good for the cause of social justice. Looting and burning businesses, and assaulting their owners, isn’t social justice, or even social protest. It’s crime. And having imagery of these crimes that highlight black involvement circulate endlessly on Fox News and on social media cannot be good for the black community. But it might yet be good for Trump.</p>
<p>And it could well kick open the door to a level of authoritarianism that many of us who have been very worried about Trump barely considered possible. It’s always seemed somewhat paranoid to me to wonder whether we’re living in Weimar Germany. I’ve had many conversations about this. I had <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-road-to-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Snyder on the podcast</a>, who’s been worrying about the prospect of tyranny in the US for several years now. I’ve known, in the abstract, that democracies can destroy themselves. But the idea that it could happen here still seemed totally outlandish to me. It doesn’t anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, what we’ve been seeing in the streets isn’t just one thing. Some people are protesting for reasons that I fully defend. They’re outraged by specific instances of police violence, like the killing of George Floyd, and they’re worried about creeping authoritarianism—which we really should be worried about now. And they’re convinced that our politics is broken, because it is broken, and they are deeply concerned that our response to the pandemic and the implosion of our economy will do nothing to address the widening inequality in our society. And they recognize that we have a President who is an incompetent, divisive, conman and a crackpot at a time when we actually need wise leadership.</p>
<p>All of that is hard to put on a sign, but it’s all worth protesting.</p>
<p>However, it seems to me that most protesters are seeing this moment exclusively through the lens of identity politics—and racial politics in particular. And some of them are even celebrating the breakdown of law and order, or at least remaining nonjudgmental about it. And you could see, in the early days of this protest, news anchors take that line, on CNN, for instance. Talking about the history of social protest, “Sometimes it has to be violent, right? What, do you think all of these protests need to be nonviolent?” Those words came out of Chris Cuomo&#8217;s mouth, and Don Lemon&#8217;s mouth. Many people have been circulating a half quote from Martin Luther King Jr. about riots being “the language of the unheard.” They’re <a href="https://youtu.be/pjYZZC5i_AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving out the part</a> where he made it clear that he believed riots harmed the cause of the black community and helped the cause of racists.</p>
<p>There are now calls to defund and even to abolish the police. This may be psychologically understandable when you’ve spent half your day on Twitter watching videos of cops beating peaceful protesters. Those videos are infuriating. And I’ll have a lot more to say about police violence in a minute. But if you think a society without cops is a society you would want to live in, you have lost your mind. Giving a monopoly on violence to the state is just about the best thing we have ever done as a species. It ranks right up there with keeping our shit out of our food. Having a police force that can deter crime, and solve crimes when they occur, and deliver violent criminals to a functioning justice system, is the necessary precondition for almost anything else of value in society.</p>
<p>We need police reform, of course. There are serious questions to ask about the culture of policing—its hiring practices, training, the militarization of so many police forces, outside oversight, how police departments deal with corruption, the way the police unions keep bad cops on the job, and yes, the problem of racist cops. But the idea that any serious person thinks we can do without the police—or that less trained and less vetted cops will magically be better than more trained and more vetted ones—this just reveals that our conversation on these topics has run completely off the rails. Yes, we should give more resources to community services. We should have psychologists or social workers make first contact with the homeless or the mentally ill. Perhaps we’re giving cops jobs they shouldn’t be doing. All of that makes sense to rethink. But the idea that what we&#8217;re witnessing now is a matter of the cops being over-resourced—that we&#8217;ve given them too much training, that we&#8217;ve made the job too attractive—so that the people we’re recruiting are of too high a quality. That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s been alarming here is that we’re seeing prominent people—in government, in media, in Hollywood, in sports—speak and act as though the breakdown of civil society, and of society itself, is a form of progress and any desire for law enforcement is itself a form of racist oppression. At one point the woman who&#8217;s running the City Council in Minneapolis, which just decided to abolish the police force, was asked by a journalist, I believe on CNN, “What do I do if someone&#8217;s breaking into my house in the middle of the night? Who do I call?” And her first response to that question was, “You need to recognize what a statement of privilege that question is.” She&#8217;s since had to walk that back, because it&#8217;s one of the most galling and embarrassing things a public official has ever said, but this is how close the Democratic Party is to sounding completely insane. You cannot say that if someone is breaking into your house, and you&#8217;re terrified, and you want a police force that can respond, that fear is a symptom of “white privilege.” This is where Democratic politics goes to die.</p>
<p>Again, what is alarming about this is that this woke analysis of the breakdown of law and order will only encourage an increasingly authoritarian response, as well as the acceptance of that response by many millions of Americans.</p>
<p>If you step back, you will notice that there is a kind of ecstasy of ideological conformity in the air. And it’s destroying institutions. It&#8217;s destroying the very institutions we rely on to get our information—universities, the press. The New York Times in recent days, seems to be preparing for a self-immolation in recent days. No one wants to say or even think anything that makes anyone uncomfortable—certainly not anyone who has more wokeness points than they do. It’s just become too dangerous. There are people <a href="https://wwos.nine.com.au/news/nba-announcer-fired-over-controversial-all-lives-matter-tweet/a9a50198-4b52-4cb7-a800-e0ffacb3302d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being fired</a> for tweeting “All Lives Matter.” #AllLivesMatter, in the current environment, is being read as a naked declaration of white supremacy. That is how weird this moment is. A soccer player on the LA Galaxy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/rowdies/2020/06/05/la-galaxy-releases-player-after-wifes-racist-and-violent-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fired</a> for something his wife tweeted…</p>
<p>Of course, there are real problems of inequality and despair at the bottom of these protests. People who have never found a secure or satisfying place in the world—or young people who fear they never will—people who have seen their economic prospects simply vanish, and people who have had painful encounters with racism and racist cops—people by the millions are now surrendering themselves to a kind of religious awakening. But like most religious awakenings, this movement is not showing itself eager to make honest contact with reality.</p>
<p>On top of that, we find extraordinarily privileged people, whatever the color of their skin—people who have been living wonderful lives in their gated communities or 5<sup>th</sup> avenue apartments—and who feel damn guilty about it—they are supporting this movement uncritically, for many reasons. Of course, they care about other people—I’m sure most of them have the same concerns about inequality that I do—but they are also supporting this movement because it promises a perfect expiation of their sins. If you have millions of dollars, and shoot botox into your face, and vacation on St. Bart’s, and you’re liberal—the easiest way to sleep at night is to be as woke as AOC and like every one of her tweets.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just with the looting, and the arson, and the violence. There are problems with these peaceful protests themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not questioning anyone’s right to protest. Even our deranged president can pay lip service to that right—which he did as the DC police were violently dispersing a peaceful protest so that he could get his picture taken in front of that church, awkwardly holding a bible, as though he had never held a book in life.</p>
<p>The problem with the protests is that they are animated, to a remarkable degree, by confusion and misinformation. And I’ll explain why I think that’s the case. And, of course, this will be controversial. Needless to say, many people will consider the color of my skin to be disqualifying here. I could have invited any number of great, black intellectuals onto the podcast to make these points for me. But that struck me as a form of cowardice. Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Coleman Hughes, Kmele Foster, these guys might not agree with everything I’m about to say, but any one of them could walk the tightrope I’m now stepping out on far more credibly than I can.</p>
<p>But, you see, that’s part of the problem. The perception that the color of a person’s skin, or even his life experience, matters for this discussion is a pernicious illusion. For the discussion we really need to have, the color of a person’s skin, and even his life experience, simply does not matter. It cannot matter. We have to break this spell that the politics of identity has cast over everything.</p>
<p>Ok…</p>
<p>As I’ve already acknowledged, there is a legacy of racism in the United States that we’re still struggling to outgrow. That is obvious. There are real racists out there. And there are ways in which racism became institutionalized long ago. Many of you will remember that during the crack epidemic the penalties for crack and powder cocaine were quite different. And this led black drug offenders to be locked up for much longer than white ones. Now, whether the motivation for that policy was consciously racist or not, I don’t know, but it was effectively racist. Nothing I’m about to say entails a denial of these sorts of facts. There just seems to be no question that boys who grow up with their fathers in prison start life with a significant strike against them. So criminal justice reform is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>And I’m not denying that many black people, perhaps most, have interactions with cops, and others in positions of power, or even random strangers, that seem unambiguously racist. Sometimes this is because they are actually in the presence of racism, and perhaps sometimes it only seems that way. I’ve had unpleasant encounters with cops, and customs officers, and TSA screeners, and bureaucrats of every kind, and even with people working in stores or restaurants. People aren’t always nice or ethical. But being white, and living in a majority white society, I’ve never had to worry about whether any of these collisions were the result of racism. And I can well imagine that in some of these situations, had I been black, I would have come away feeling that I had encountered yet another racist in the wild. So I consider myself very lucky to have gone through life not having to think about any of that. Surely that’s one form of white privilege.</p>
<p>So, nothing I’m going to say denies that we should condemn racism—whether interpersonal or institutional—and we should condemn it wherever we find it. But as a society, we simply can’t afford to find and condemn racism where it doesn’t exist. And we should be increasingly aware of the costs of doing that. The more progress we make on issues of race, the less racism there will be to find, and the more likely we’ll find ourselves chasing after its ghost.</p>
<p>The truth is, we have made considerable progress on the problem of racism in America. This isn’t 1920, and it isn’t 1960. We had a two-term black president. We have black congressmen and women. We have black mayors and black chiefs of police. There are major cities, like Detroit and Atlanta, going on their fifth or sixth consecutive black mayor. Having more and more black people in positions of real power, in what is still a majority white society, is progress on the problem of racism. And the truth is, it might not even solve the problem we’re talking about. When Freddy Gray was killed in Baltimore, virtually everyone who could have been held accountable for his death was black. The problem of police misconduct and reform is complicated, as we’re about to see. But obviously, there is more work to do on the problem of racism. And, more important, there is much more work to do to remedy the inequalities in our society that are so correlated with race, and will still be correlated with race, even after the last racist has been driven from our shores.</p>
<p>The question of how much of today’s inequality is due to existing racism—whether racist people or racist policies—is a genuinely difficult question to answer. And to answer it, we need to distinguish the past from the present.</p>
<p>Take wealth inequality, for example: The median white family has a net worth of around $170,000—these data are a couple of years old, but they’re probably pretty close to what’s true now. The median black family has a net worth of around $17,000. So we have a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/06/18/a-conversation-about-the-racial-wealth-gap-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenfold difference in median wealth</a>. (That’s the median, not the mean: Half of white families are below 170,000 and half above; half of black families are below 17,000 and half above. And we’re talking about wealth here, not income.)</p>
<p>This disparity in wealth persists even for people whose incomes are in the top 10 percent of the income distribution. For whites in the top 10 percent for income, the median net worth is $1.8 million; for blacks it’s around $350,000. There are probably many things that account for this disparity in wealth. It seems that black families that make it to the top of the income distribution fall out of it more easily than white families do. But it’s also undeniable that black families have less intergenerational wealth accumulated through inheritance.</p>
<p>How much of this is inequality due to the legacy of slavery? And how much of it is due to an ensuing century of racist policies? I’m prepared to believe quite a lot. And it strikes me as totally legitimate to think about paying reparations as a possible remedy here. Of course, one will then need to talk about reparations for the Native Americans. And then one wonders where this all ends. And what about blacks who aren’t descended from slaves, but who still suffered the consequences of racism in the US? In listening to people like <a href="https://youtu.be/FXt9Q5h1sCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McWhorter</a> and Coleman Hughes discuss this topic, I’m inclined to think that reparations is probably unworkable as a policy. But the truth is that I’m genuinely unsure about this.</p>
<p>Whatever we decide about the specific burdens of the past, we have to ask, how much of current wealth inequality is due to existing racism and to existing policies that make it harder for black families to build wealth? And the only way to get answers to those questions is to have a dispassionate discussion about facts.</p>
<p>The problem with the social activism we are now seeing—what John McWhorter has called “the new religion of anti-Racism”—is that it finds racism nearly everywhere, even where it manifestly does not exist. And this is incredibly damaging to the cause of achieving real equality in our society. It’s almost impossible to exaggerate the evil and injustice of slavery and its aftermath. But it is possible to exaggerate how much racism currently exists at an Ivy League university, or in Silicon Valley, or at the Oscars. And those exaggerations are toxic—and, perversely, they may produce more real racism. It seems to me that false claims of victimhood can diminish the social stature of any group, even a group that has a long history of real victimization.</p>
<p>The imprecision here—the bad-faith arguments, the double standards, the goal-post shifting, the <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hrFzz1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idiotic opinion pieces</a> in the New York Times, the defenestrations on social media, the general hysteria that the cult of wokeness has produced—I think this is all extremely harmful to civil society, and to effective liberal politics, and to the welfare of African Americans.</p>
<p>So, with that as preamble, let’s return to the tragic death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>As I said, I believe that any sane person who watches that video will feel that they have witnessed a totally unjustified killing. So, people of any race, are right to be horrified by what happened there. But now I want to ask a few questions, and I want us to try to consider them dispassionately. And I really want you to watch your mind while you do this. There are very likely to be few tripwires installed there, and I’m about to hit them. So just do your best to remain calm.</p>
<p>Does the killing of George Floyd prove that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>Does it even suggest that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>In other words, do we have reason to believe that, had Floyd been white, he wouldn’t have died in a similar way?</p>
<p>Do the dozen or so other videos that have emerged in recent years, of black men being killed by cops, do they prove, or even suggest, that there is an epidemic of lethal police violence directed especially at black men and that this violence is motivated by racism?</p>
<p>Most people seem to think that the answers to these questions are so obvious that to even pose them as I just did is obscene. The answer is YES, and it’s a yes that now needs to be shouted in the streets.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that if you take even 5 minutes to look at the data on crime and police violence, the answer appears to be “no,” in every case, albeit with one important caveat. I’m not talking about how the police behaved in 1970 or even 1990. But in the last 25 years, violent crime has come down significantly in the US, and so has the police use of deadly force. And as you’re about to see, the police used more deadly force against white people—both in absolute numbers, and in terms of their contribution to crime and violence in our society. But the public perception is, of course, completely different.</p>
<p>In a city like Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-12/lapd-use-of-force-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 was a 30-year low</a> for police shootings. Think about that…. Do the people who were protesting in Los Angeles, peacefully and violently, do the people who were ransacking and burning businesses by the hundreds—in many cases, businesses that will not return to their neighborhoods—do the people who caused so much damage to the city, that certain neighborhoods, ironically the neighborhoods that are disproportionately black, will take years, probably decades to recover, do the celebrities who supported them, and even bailed them out of jail—do any of these people know that 2019 was the 30-year low for police shootings in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Before I step out further over the abyss here, let me reiterate: Many of you are going to feel a visceral negative reaction to what I’m about to say. You’re not going to like the way it sounds. You’re especially not going to like the way it sounds coming from a white guy. This feeling of not liking, this feeling of outrage, this feeling of disgust—this feeling of “Sam, what the fuck is wrong with you, why are you even touching this topic?”—this feeling isn’t an argument. It isn’t, or shouldn’t be, the basis for your believing anything to be true or false about the world.</p>
<p>Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that I or anyone else needs to respect. Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that you should respect. In fact, it is something that you should be on your guard for. Perhaps more than any other property of your mind, this feeling can mislead you.</p>
<p>If you care about justice—and you absolutely should—you should care about facts and the ability to discuss them openly. Justice requires contact with reality. It simply isn’t the case—it cannot be the case—that the most pressing claims on our sense of justice need come from those who claim to be the most offended by conversation itself.</p>
<p>So, I’m going to speak the language of facts right now, in so far as we know them, all the while knowing that these facts run very much counter to most people’s assumptions. Many of the things you think you know about crime and violence in our society are almost certainly wrong. And that should matter to you.</p>
<p>So just take a moment and think this through with me.</p>
<p>How many people are killed each year in America by cops? If you don’t know, guess. See if you have any intuitions for these numbers. Because your intuitions are determining how you interpret horrific videos of the sort we saw coming out of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The answer for many years running is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 1000</a>. One thousand people are killed by cops in America each year. There are about 50 to 60 million encounters between civilians and cops each year, and <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 10 million arrests</a>. That’s down from a high of over 14 million arrests annually throughout the 1990’s. So, of the 10 million occasions where a person attracts the attention of the police, and the police decide to make an arrest, about 1000 of those people die as a result. (I’m sure a few people get killed even when no arrest was attempted, but that has to be a truly tiny number.) So, without knowing anything else about the situation, if the cops decide to arrest you, it would be reasonable to think that your chance of dying is around 1/10,000. Of course, in the United States, it’s higher than it is in other countries. So I’m not saying that this number is acceptable. But it is what it is for a reason, as we’re about to see.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few generic things I’d like to point here before we get further into the data. They should be uncontroversial.</p>
<p>First, it’s almost certainly the case that of these 1000 officer-caused deaths each year, some are entirely justified—it may even be true that most are entirely justified—and some are entirely unjustified, and some are much harder to judge. And that will be true next year. And the year after that.</p>
<p>Of the unjustified killings, there are vast differences between them. Many have nothing in common but for the fact that a cop killed someone unnecessarily. It might have been a terrible misunderstanding, or incompetence, or just bad luck, and in certain cases it could be a cop who decides to murder someone because he’s become enraged, or he’s just a psychopath. And it is certainly possible that racial bias accounts for some number of these unjustified killings.</p>
<p>Another point that should be uncontroversial—but may sound a little tone-deaf in the current environment, where we’ve inundated with videos of police violence in response to these protests. But this has to be acknowledged whenever we’re discussing this topic: Cops have a very hard job. In fact, in the current environment, they have an almost impossible job.</p>
<p>If you’re making 10 million arrests every year, some number of people will decide not to cooperate. There can be many reasons for this. A person could be mentally ill, or drunk, or on drugs. Of course, rather often the person is an actual criminal who doesn’t want to be arrested.</p>
<p>Among innocent people, and perhaps this getting more common these days, a person might feel that resisting arrest is the right thing to do, ethically or politically or as a matter of affirming his identity. After all, put yourself in his shoes, he did nothing wrong. Why are the cops arresting him? I don’t know if we have data on the numbers of people who resist arrest by race. But I can well imagine that if it’s common for African Americans to believe that the only reason they have been singled out for arrest is due to racism on the part of the police, that could lead to greater levels of non-compliance. Which seems very likely to lead to more unnecessary injury and death. This is certainly one reason why it is wise to have the racial composition of a police force mirror that of the community it’s policing. Unfortunately, there’s no evidence that this will reduce lethal violence from the side of the police. In fact, the evidence we have suggests that black and Hispanic cops are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. But it would surely change the perception of the community that racism is a likely explanation for police behavior, which itself might reduce conflict.</p>
<p>When a cop goes hands on a person in an attempt to control his movements or make an arrest, that person’s resistance poses a problem that most people don’t understand. If you haven’t studied this topic. If you don’t know what it physically takes to restrain and immobilize a non-compliant person who may be bigger and stronger than you are, and if you haven’t thought through the implications of having a gun on your belt while attempting to do that—a gun that can be grabbed and used against you, or against a member of the public—then your intuitions about what makes sense here, tactically and ethically, are very likely to be bad.</p>
<p>If you haven’t trained with firearms under stress. If you don’t know how suddenly situations can change. If you haven’t experienced how quickly another person can close the distance on you, and how little time you have to decide to draw your weapon. If you don’t know how hard it is to shoot a moving target, or even a stationary one, when your heart is beating out of your chest. You very likely have totally unreasonable ideas about what we can expect from cops in situations like these. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwWado4SVY&amp;bpctr=1592453276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbOLb0O7Pw&amp;bpctr=1592455027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_87GBOCVYTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]</p>
<p>And there is another fact that looms over all this like the angel of Death, literally: Most cops do not get the training they need. They don’t get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQLOmfx8X_E&amp;feature=emb_title">hand-to-hand training</a> they need—they don’t have good skills to subdue people without harming them. All you need to do is watch YouTube videos of botched arrests to see this. The martial arts community stands in perpetual astonishment at <a href="https://youtu.be/F4VeHOkt_o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kinds of things cops do and fail to do</a> once they start fighting with suspects. Cops also don’t get the firearms training they need. Of course, there are elite units in many police departments, but most cops do not have the training they need to do the job they’re being asked to do.</p>
<p>It is also true, no doubt, that some cops are racist bullies. And there are corrupt police departments that cover for these guys, and cover up police misconduct generally, whether it was borne of racism or not.</p>
<p>But the truth is that even if we got rid of all bad cops, which we absolutely should do, and there were only good people left, and we got all these good people the best possible training, and we gave them the best culture in which to think about their role in society, and we gave them the best methods for de-escalating potentially violent situations—which we absolutely must do—and we scrubbed all the dumb laws from our books, so that when cops were required to enforce the law, they were only risking their lives and the lives of civilians for reasons that we deem necessary and just—so the war on drugs is obviously over—even under these conditions of perfect progress, we are still guaranteed to have some number of cases each year where a cop kills a civilian in a way that is totally unjustified, and therefore tragic. Every year, there will be some number of families who will be able to say that the cops killed their son or daughter, or father or mother, or brother or sister. And videos of these killings will occasionally surface, and they will be horrific. This seems guaranteed to happen.</p>
<p>So, while we need to make all these improvements, we still need to understand that there are very likely always to going to be videos of cops doing something inexplicable, or inexplicably stupid, that results in an innocent person’s death, or a not-so-innocent person’s death. And sometimes the cop will be white and the victim will be black. We have 10 million arrests each year. And we now live in a panopticon where practically everything is videotaped.</p>
<p>I’m about to get further into the details of what we know about police violence, but I want to just put it to you now: If we’re going to let the health of race relations in this country, or the relationship between the community and the police, depend on whether we ever see a terrible video of police misconduct again, the project of healing these wounds in our society is doomed.</p>
<p>About a week into these protests I heard Van Jones on CNN say, “If we see one more video of a cop brutalizing a black man, this country could go over the edge.” He said this, not as indication of how dangerously inflamed people have become. He seemed to be saying it as an ultimatum to the police. With 10 million arrests a year, arrests that have to take place in the most highly armed society in the developed world, I hope you understand how unreasonable that ultimatum is.</p>
<p>We have to put these videos into context. And we have to acknowledge how different they are from one another. Some of them are easy to interpret. But some are quite obviously being interpreted incorrectly by most people—especially by activists. And there are a range of cases—some have video associated with them and some don’t—that are now part of a litany of anti-racist outrage, and the names of the dead are intoned as though they were all evidence of the same injustice. And yet, they are not.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XKQqgVlk0NQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Scott</a> was stopped for a broken taillight and got out of his car and tried to flee. There might have been a brief struggle over the officer’s taser, that part of the video isn’t clear. But what is clear is that he was shot in the back multiple times as he was running away. That was insane. There was zero reason for the officer to feel that his life was under threat at the point he opened fire. And for that unjustified shooting, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. I’m not sure that’s long enough. That seemed like straight-up murder.</p>
<p>The George Floyd video, while even more disturbing to watch, is harder to interpret. I don’t know anything about Derek Chauvin, the cop who knelt on his neck. It’s quite possible that he’s a terrible person who should have never been a cop. He seems to have a significant number of complaints against him—though, as far as I know, the details of those complaints haven’t been released. And he might be a racist on top of being a bad cop. Or he might be a guy who was totally in over his head and thought you could restrain someone indefinitely by keeping a knee on their neck indefinitely. I don’t know. I’m sure more facts will come out. But whoever he is, I find it very unlikely that he was intending to kill George Floyd. Think about it. He was surrounded by irate witnesses and being filmed. Unless he was aspiring to become the most notorious murderer in human history, it seems very unlikely that he was intending to commit murder in that moment. It’s possible, of course. But it doesn’t seem the likeliest explanation for his behavior.</p>
<p>What I believe we saw on that video was the result of a tragic level of negligence and poor training on the part of those cops. Or terrible recruitment—it’s possible that none of these guys should have ever been cops. I think for one of them, it was only his fourth day on the job. Just imagine that. Just imagine all things you don’t know as a new cop.  It could also be a function of bad luck in terms of Floyd’s underlying health. It’s been reported that he was complaining of being unable to breath before Chauvin pinned him with his knee. The knee on his neck might not have been the only thing that caused his death. It could have also been the weight of the other officer pinning him down.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly what happened in the cast of Eric Garner. Half the people on earth believe they witnessed a cop choke Eric Garner to death in that video. That does not appear to be what happened. When Eric Garner is saying “I can’t breathe” he’s not being choked. He’s being held down on the pavement by several officers. Being forced down on your stomach under the weight of several people can kill a person, especially someone with lung or heart disease. In the case of Eric Garner, it is absolutely clear that the cop who briefly attempted to choke him was no longer choking him. If you doubt that, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/Nql1xRtWKOU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> again.</p>
<p>And if you are recoiling now from my interpretation of these videos, you really should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_c-E_i8Q5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the killing of Tony Timpa</a>. It’s also terribly disturbing, but it removes the variable of race and it removes any implication of intent to harm on the part of the cops about as clearly as you could ask. It really is worth watching as a corrective to our natural interpretation of these other videos.</p>
<p>Tony Timpa was a white man in Dallas, who was suffering some mental health emergency and cocaine intoxication. And he actually called 911 himself. What we see is the bodycam footage from the police, which shows that he was already in handcuffs when they arrived—a security guard had cuffed him. And then the cops take over, and they restrain Timpa on the ground, by rolling him onto a stomach and putting their weight on him, very much like in the case of Eric Garner. And they keep their weight on him—one cop has a knee on his upper back, which is definitely much less aggressive than a knee on the neck—but they crush the life out of him all the same, over the course of 13 minutes. He’s not being choked. The cops are not being rough. There’s no animus between them and Timpa. It was not a hostile arrest. They clearly believe that they’re responding to a mental health emergency. But they keep him down on his belly, under their weight, and they’re cracking jokes as he loses consciousness. Now, your knowledge that he’s going to be dead by the end of this video, make their jokes seem pretty callous. But this was about as benign an imposition of force by cops as you’re going to see. The crucial insight you will have watching this video, is that the officers not only had no intent to kill Tony Timpa, they don’t take his pleading seriously because they have no doubt that what they’re doing is perfectly safe—perfectly within protocol. They’ve probably done this hundreds of times before.</p>
<p>If you watch that video—and, again, fair warning, it is disturbing—but imagine how disturbing it would have been to our society if Tony Timpa had been black. If the only thing you changed about the video was the color of Timpa’s skin, then that video would have detonated like a nuclear bomb in our society, exactly as the George Floyd video did. In fact, in one way it is worse, or would have been perceived to be worse. I mean, just imagine white cops telling jokes as they crushed the life out of a black Tony Timpa… Given the nature of our conversation about violence, given the way we perceive videos of this kind, there is no way that people would have seen that as anything other than a lynching. And yet, it would not have been a lynching.</p>
<p>Now, I obviously have no idea what was in the minds of cops in Minneapolis. And perhaps we’ll learn at trial. Perhaps a tape of Chauvin using the N-word in another context will surface, bringing in a credible allegation of racism. It seems to me that Chauvin is going to have a very hard time making sense of his actions. But most people who saw that video believe they have seen, with their own eyes, beyond any possibility of doubt, a racist cop intentionally murder an innocent man. That’s not what the video necessarily shows.</p>
<p>As I said, these videos can be hard to interpret, even while seeming very easy to interpret. And these cases, whether we have associated video or not, are very different. Michael Brown is reported to have punched a cop in the face and attempted to get his gun. As far as I know, there’s no video of that encounter. But, if true, that is an entirely different situation. If you’re attacking a cop, trying to get his gun, that is a life and death struggle that almost by definition for the cop, and it most cases justifies the use of lethal force. And honestly, it seems that no one within a thousand miles of Black Lives Matter is willing to make these distinctions. An attitude of anti-racist moral outrage is not the best lens through which to interpret evidence of police misconduct.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many videos of people getting arrested. And I’ve seen the outraged public reaction to what appears to be inappropriate use of force by the cops. One overwhelming fact that comes through is that people, whatever the color of their skin, don’t understand how to behave around cops so as to keep themselves safe. People have to stop resisting arrest. This may seem obvious, but judging from most of these videos, and from the public reaction to them, this must be a totally arcane piece of information. When a cop wants to take you into custody, you don’t get to decide whether or not you should be arrested. When a cop wants to take you into custody, for whatever reason, it’s not a negotiation. And if you turn it into a wrestling match, you’re very likely to get injured or killed.</p>
<p>This is a point I once belabored in a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/racism-and-violence-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast with Glenn Loury</a>, and it became essentially a public service announcement. And I’ve gone back and listened to those comments, and I want to repeat them here. This is something that everyone really needs to understand. And it’s something that Black Lives Matter should be teaching explicitly: If you put your hands on a cop—if you start wrestling with a cop, or grabbing him because he’s arresting your friend, or pushing him, or striking him, or using your hands in way that can possibly be interpreted as your reaching for a gun—you are likely to get shot in the United States, whatever the color of your skin.</p>
<p>As I said, when you’re with a cop, there is always a gun out in the open. And any physical struggle has to be perceived by him as a fight for the gun. A cop doesn’t know what you’re going to do if you overpower him, so he has to assume the worst. Most cops are not confident in their ability to physically control a person without shooting him—for good reason, because they’re not well trained to do that, and they’re continually confronting people who are bigger, or younger, or more athletic, or more aggressive than they are. Cops are not superheroes. They’re ordinary people with insufficient training, and once things turn physical they cannot afford to give a person who is now assaulting a police officer the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>This is something that most people seem totally confused about. If they see a video of somebody trying to punch a cop in the face and the person’s unarmed, many people think the cop should just punch back, and any use of deadly force would be totally disproportionate. But that’s not how violence works. It’s not the cop’s job to be the best bare-knuckled boxer on Earth so he doesn’t have to use his gun. A cop can’t risk getting repeatedly hit in the face and knocked out, because there’s always a gun in play. This is the cop’s perception of the world, and it’s a justifiable one, given the dynamics of human violence.</p>
<p>You might think cops shouldn’t carry guns. Why can’t we just be like England? That’s a point that can be debated. But it requires considerable thought in a country where there are over 300 million guns on the street. The United States is not England.</p>
<p>Again, really focus on what is happening when a cop is attempting to arrest a person. It’s not up to you to decide whether or not you should be arrested. Does it matter that you know you didn’t do anything wrong? No. And how could that fact be effectively communicated in the moment by your not following police commands? I’m going to ask that again: How could the fact that you’re innocent, that you’re not a threat to cop, that you’re not about to suddenly attack him or produce a weapon of your own, how could those things be effectively communicated at the moment he’s attempting to arrest you by your resisting arrest?</p>
<p>Unless you called the cops yourself, you never know what situation you’re in. If I’m walking down the street, I don’t know if the cop who is approaching me didn’t get a call that some guy who looks like Ben Stiller just committed an armed robbery. I know I didn’t do anything, but I don’t know what’s in the cop’s head. The time to find out what’s going on—the time to complain about racist cops, the time to yell at them and tell them they’re all going to get fired for their stupidity and misconduct—is after cooperating, at the police station, in the presence of a lawyer, preferably. But to not comply in the heat of the moment, when a guy with the gun is issuing commands—this raises your risk astronomically, and it’s something that most people, it seems, just do not intuitively understand, even when they’re not in the heat of the moment themselves, but just watching video of other people getting arrested.</p>
<p>Ok. End of public-service announcement.</p>
<p>The main problem with using individual cases, where black men and women have been killed by cops, to conclude that there is an epidemic of racist police violence in our society, is that you can find nearly identical cases of white suspects being killed by cops, and there are actually more of them.</p>
<p>In 2016, John McWhorter wrote a <a href="https://time.com/4404987/police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> in Time Magazine about this.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of what he wrote:</p>
<p>“The heart of the indignation over these murders is a conviction that racist bias plays a decisive part in these encounters. That has seemed plausible to me, and I have recently challenged those who disagree to present a list of white people killed within the past few years under circumstances similar to those that so enrage us in cases such as what happened to Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Walter Scott, Sam Debose, and others.”</p>
<p>So, McWhorter issued that challenge, as he said, and he was presented with the cases [<a href="https://youtu.be/EPxNUKw0kV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/VBUUx0jUKxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6KhRcIOuurI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]. But there’s no song about these people, admonishing us to say their names. And the list of white names is longer, and I don’t know any of them, other than Tony Timpa. I know the black names. In addition to the ones I just read from McWhorter’s article, I know the names of Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, and Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile, and now, of course, I know the name of George Floyd. And I’m aware of many of the details of these cases where black men and women have been killed by cops. I know the name of Breonna Taylor. I can’t name a single white person killed by cops in circumstances like these—other than Timpa—and I just read McWhorter’s article where he lists many of them.</p>
<p>So, this is also a distortion in the media. The media is not showing us videos of white people being killed by cops; activists are not demanding that they do this. I&#8217;m sure white supremacists talk about this stuff a lot, who knows? But in terms of the story we&#8217;re telling ourselves in the mainstream, we are not actually talking about the data on lethal police violence.</p>
<p>So back to the data: Again, cops kill around 1000 people every year in the United States. About 25 percent are black. About 50 percent are white. The data on police homicide are all over the place. The federal government does not have a single repository for data of this kind. But they have been pretty carefully tracked by outside sources, like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, for the last 5 years. These ratios appear stable over time. Again, many of these killings are justifiable, we’re talking about career criminals who are often armed and, in many cases, trying to kill the cops. Those aren’t the cases we’re worried about. We’re worried about the unjustifiable homicides.</p>
<p>Now, some people will think that these numbers still represent an outrageous injustice. Afterall, African Americans are only 13 percent of the population. So, at most, they should be 13 percent of the victims of police violence, not 25 percent. Any departure from the baseline population must be due to racism.</p>
<p>Ok. Well, that sounds plausible, but consider a few more facts:</p>
<p>Blacks are 13 percent of the population, but they commit <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 50 percent</a> of the murders and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883">other violent crimes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have 13 percent of the population responsible for 50 percent of the murders—and in some cities committing 2/3rds of all violent crime—what percent of police attention should it attract? I don’t know. But I’m pretty sure it’s not just 13 percent. Given that the overwhelming majority of their victims are black, I’m pretty sure that most black people wouldn’t set the dial at 13 percent either.</p>
<p>And here we arrive at the core of the problem. The story of crime in America is overwhelmingly the story of black-on-black crime. It is also, in part, a story of black-on-white crime. For more than a generation, crime in America really hasn’t been a story of much white-on-black crime. [Some listeners mistook my meaning here. I&#8217;m not denying that most violent crime is intraracial. So, it&#8217;s true that most white homicide victims are killed by white offenders. Per capita, however, the white crime rate is much lower than the black crime rate. And there is more black-on-white crime than white-on-black crime.—SH]</p>
<p>The murder rate has come down steadily since the early 1990’s, with only minor upticks. But, nationwide, blacks are still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 times more likely</a> to get murdered than whites, and in some cities their risk is double that. And <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/wiener/programs/pcj/files/PoliceandPublicDiscourseBlackonBlackViolence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 95 percent</a> of the murders are committed by members of the African American community. [While reported in 2015, these data were more than a decade old. Looking at more recent data from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI’s Uniform Crime Report</a>, the number appears to be closer to 90 percent.—SH]</p>
<p>The weekend these protests and riots were kicking off nationwide—when our entire country seemed to be tearing itself apart over a perceived epidemic of racist police violence against the black community, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-sees-18-homicides-deadliest-day-60-years/story?id=71150234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">92 people were shot, and 27 killed</a>, in Chicago alone—one city. This is almost entirely a story of black men killing members of their own community. And this is far more representative of the kind of violence that the black community needs to worry about. And, ironically, it’s clear that one remedy for this violence is, or would be, effective policing.</p>
<p>These are simply the facts of crime in our society as we best understand them. And the police have to figure out how to respond to these facts, professionally and ethically. The question is, are they doing that? And, obviously, there’s considerable doubt that they&#8217;re doing that, professionally and ethically.</p>
<p>Roland Fryer, the Harvard economist who’s work I discussed on the podcast with Glenn Loury, studied police encounters involving black and white suspects and the use of force.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> is titled, this from 2016, “An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force.”</p>
<p>Fryer is black, and he went into this research with the expectation that the data would confirm that there’s an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at black men. But he didn’t find that. However, he did find support for the suspicion that black people suffer more nonlethal violence at the hands of cops than whites do.</p>
<p>So let’s look at this.</p>
<p>The study examined data from 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida and California. Generally, Fryer found that there is 25 percent greater likelihood that the police would go hands on black suspects than white ones—cuffing them, or forcing them to ground, or using other non-lethal force.</p>
<p>Specifically, in New York City, in encounters where white and black citizens were matched for other characteristics, they found that:</p>
<p>Cops were…</p>
<ul>
<li>17 percent more likely to go hands on black suspects</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them into a wall</li>
<li>16 percent more likely to put them in handcuffs (in a situation in which they aren&#8217;t arrested)</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them to the ground</li>
<li>25 percent more likely to use pepper spray or a baton</li>
<li>19 percent more likely to draw their guns</li>
<li>24 percent more likely to point a gun at them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more or less the full continuum of violence short of using lethal force. And it seems, from the data we have, that blacks receive more of it than whites. What accounts for this disparity? Racism? Maybe. However, as I said, it’s inconvenient to note that other data suggest that black cops and Hispanic cops are more likely to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. I’m not sure how an ambient level of racism explains that.</p>
<p>Are there other explanations? Well, again, could it be that blacks are less cooperative with the police. If so, that’s worth understanding. A culture of resisting arrest would be a very bad thing to cultivate, given that the only response to such resistance is for the police to increase their use of force.</p>
<p>Whatever is true here is something we should want to understand. And it’s all too easy to see how an increased number of encounters with cops, due to their policing in the highest crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black, and an increased number of traffic stops in those neighborhoods, and an increased propensity for cops to go hands-on these suspects, with or without an arrest, for whatever reason—it’s easy to see how all of this could be the basis for a perception of racism, whether or not racism is the underlying motivation.</p>
<p>It is totally humiliating to be arrested or manhandled by a cop. And, given the level of crime in the black community, a disproportionate number of innocent black men seem guaranteed to have this experience. It’s totally understandable that this would make them bitter and mistrustful of the police. This is another vicious circle that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>But Fryer also found that black suspects are around 25 percent less likely to be shot than white suspects are. And in the most egregious situations, where officers were not first attacked, but nevertheless fired their weapons at a suspect, they were more likely to do this when the suspect was white.</p>
<p>Again, the data are incomplete. This doesn’t not cover every city in the country. And a larger study tomorrow might paint a different picture. But, as far as I know, the best data we have suggest that for, whatever reason, whites are more likely to be killed by cops once an arrest is attempted. And a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more recent study</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  by David Johnson and colleagues found similar results. And it is simply undeniable that more whites are killed by cops each year, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to their contributions to crime and violence in our society.</p>
<p>Can you hear how these facts should be grinding in that well-oiled machine of woke outrage? Our society is in serious trouble now. We are being crushed under the weight of a global pandemic and our response to it has been totally inept. On top of that, we’re being squeezed by the growing pressure of what might become a full-on economic depression. And the streets are now filled with people who imagine, on the basis of seeing some horrific videos, that there is an epidemic of racist cops murdering African Americans. Look at what this belief is doing to our politics. And these videos will keep coming. And the truth is they could probably be matched 2 for 1 with videos of white people being killed by cops. What percentage of people protesting understand that the disparity runs this way? In light of the belief that the disparity must run the other way, people are now quite happy to risk getting beaten and arrested by cops themselves, and to even loot and burn businesses. And most people and institutions are supporting this civil unrest from the sidelines, because they too imagine that cops are killing black people in extraordinary numbers. And all of this is calling forth an authoritarian response from Trump—and leading to more examples of police violence caught on video.</p>
<p>As I hope I’ve made clear, we need police reform—there’s no question about this. And some of the recent footage of the police attacking peaceful protests is outrageous. Nothing I just said should signify that I’m unaware of that. From what I’ve seen—and by the time I release this podcast, the character of all this might have changed—but, from what I’ve seen, the police were dangerously passive in the face of looting and real crime, at least in the beginning. In many cities, they just stood and watched society unravel. And then they were far too aggressive in the face of genuinely peaceful protests. This is a terrible combination. It is the worst combination. There’s no better way to increase cynicism and anger and fear, on all sides.</p>
<p>But racializing how we speak about the problem of police violence, where race isn’t actually the relevant variable—again, think of Tony Timpa— this has highly negative effects. First, it keeps us from talking about the real problems with police tactics. For instance, we had the recent case of Breonna Taylor who was killed in a so-called “no knock” raid of her home. As occasionally happens, in this carnival of moral error we call “the war on drugs,” the police had the wrong address, and they kicked in the wrong door. And they wound up killing a totally innocent woman. But this had nothing to do with race. The problem is not, as some commentators have alleged, that it’s not safe to be “sleeping while black.” The problem is that these no-knock raids are an obscenely dangerous way of enforcing despicably stupid laws. White people die under precisely these same circumstances, and very likely in greater numbers (I don’t have data specifically on no-knock raids, but we can assume that the ratio is probably conserved here).</p>
<p>Think about how crazy this policy is in a nation where gun ownership is so widespread. If someone kicks in your door in the middle of the night, and you’re a gun owner, of course you’re going to reach for your gun. That’s why you have a gun in the first place. The fact that people bearing down on you and your family out of the darkness might have yelled “police” (or might have not yelled “police”; it’s alleged in some of these cases that they don’t yell anything)—the fact that someone yells “police” isn’t necessarily convincing. Anyone can yell “police.” And, again, think of the psychology of this: If the police have the wrong house, and you know there is no reason on earth that real cops would take an interest in you, especially in the middle of the night, because you haven’t done anything (you’re not the guy running a meth lab)—and now you’re reaching for your gun in the dark—of course, someone is likely to get killed. This is not a racial issue. It’s a terrible policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process of police reform isn’t straightforward—and it is made massively more complicated by what’s happening now. Yes, we will be urging police reform in a very big way now, that much seems clear. But Roland Fryer <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also shown</a> that investigations of the cops, in a climate where viral videos and racial politics are operating, have dramatic effects, many of which are negative.</p>
<p>He studied the aftermath of the investigations into police misconduct that followed the killings Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, and Lequan McDonald, and found that, for reasons that seem pretty easy to intuit, proactive police contact with civilians decreases drastically, sometimes by as much 100 percent, once these investigations get started. This is now called “The Ferguson Effect.” The police still answer 911 calls, but they don’t investigate suspicious activity in the same way. They don’t want to wind up on YouTube. And when they alter their behavior like this, homicides go up. Fryer estimates that the effects of these few investigations translated into 1000 extra homicides, and almost 40,000 more felonies, over the next 24 months in the US. And, of course, most of the victims of those crimes were black. One shudders to imagine the size of the Ferguson effect we’re about to see nationwide… I’m sure the morale among cops has never been lower. I think it’s almost guaranteed that cops by the thousands will be leaving the force. And it will be much more difficult to recruit good people.</p>
<p>Who is going to want to be a cop now? Who could be idealist about occupying that role in society? It seems to me that the population of people who will become cops now will be more or less indistinguishable from the population of people who become prison guards. I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s a difference there, and I think we&#8217;re likely to see that difference expressed in the future. It&#8217;s a grim picture, unless we do something very creative here.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a real question about how we can reform police departments, and get rid of bad cops, without negatively impacting the performance of good cops? That’s a riddle we have to solve—or at least we have to understand what the trade-offs are here.</p>
<p>Why is all of this happening now? Police killings of civilians have gone way down. And they are rare events. They are 1/10,000 level events, if measured by arrests. 1/50-60,000 level events if measured by police encounters. And the number of unarmed people who are killed is smaller still. Around 50 last year, again, more were white than black. And not all unarmed victims are innocent. Some get killed in the act of attacking the cops.  [<a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/05/19/breaking-officer-involved-shooting-in-buckingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/officer-involved-shooting-in-adair-county-oklahoma/527-e8cdc435-dcd0-429c-962f-b2c82c22068e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article36802032.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>]</p>
<p>Again, the data don’t tell a clean story, or the whole story. I see no reason to doubt that blacks get more attention from the cops—though, honestly, given the distribution of crime in our society, I don’t know what the alternative to that would be. And once the cops get involved, blacks are more likely to get roughed up, which is bad. But, again, it simply isn’t clear that racism is the cause. And contrary to everyone’s expectations, whites seem more likely to get killed by cops. Actually, one factor seems to be that whites are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 times more likely</a> to commit “suicide by cop” (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 times more likely</a> to commit suicide generally). What’s going on there? Who knows?</p>
<p>There’s a lot we don’t understand about these data. But ask yourself, would our society seem less racist if the disparity ran the other way? Is less physical contact, but a greater likelihood of getting shot and killed a form of white privilege? Is a higher level of suicide by cop, and suicide generally, a form of white privilege? We have a problem here that, read either way, you can tell a starkly racist narrative.</p>
<p>We need ethical, professional policing, of course. But the places with the highest crime in our society need the most of it. Is there any doubt about that? In a city like Milwaukee, blacks are 12 times more likely to get murdered than whites [Not sure where I came by this number, probably a lecture or podcast. It appears the rate is closer to <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/01/12/gun-homicides-milwaukee-has-two-thirds-of-states-gun-killings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 times more likely</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/07/13/residential-segregation-associated-with-black-white-disparity-in-firearm-homicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 times more likely</a> in Wisconsin as a whole—SH], again, they are being killed by other African Americans, nearly 100 percent of the time. I think the lowest figure I’ve seen is 93 percent of the time. [As noted above, more recent data suggest that it’s closer to 90 percent]. What should the police do about this? And what are they likely to do now that our entire country has been convulsed over one horrific case of police misconduct?</p>
<p>We need to lower the temperature on this conversation, and many other conversations, and understand what is actually happening in our society.</p>
<p>But instead of doing this, we now have a whole generation of social activists who seem eager to play a game of chicken with the forces of chaos. Everything I said about the problem of inequality and the need for reform stands. But I think that what we are witnessing in our streets, and on social media, and even in the mainstream press, is a version of mass hysteria. And the next horrific video of a black person being killed by cops won’t be evidence to the contrary. And there will be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a>. There are 10 million arrests every year. There will always be another video.</p>
<p>And the media has turned these videos into a form of political pornography. And this has deranged us. We’re now unable to speak or even think about facts. The media has been poisoned by bad incentives, in this regard, and social media doubly so.</p>
<p>In the mainstream of this protest movement, it’s very common to hear that the only problem with what is happening in our streets, apart from what the cops are doing, is that some criminal behavior at the margins—a little bit of looting, a little bit of violence—has distracted us from an otherwise necessary and inspiring response to an epidemic of racism. Most people in the media have taken exactly this line. People like Anderson Cooper on CNN or the editorial page of the New York Times or public figures like President Obama or Vice President Biden. The most prominent liberal voices believe that the protests themselves make perfect moral and political sense, and that movements like Black Lives Matter are guaranteed to be on the right side of history. How could anyone who is concerned about inequality and injustice in our society see things any other way? How could anyone who isn’t himself racist not support Black Lives Matter?</p>
<p>But, of course, there’s a difference between slogans and reality. There’s a difference between the branding of a movement and its actual aims. And this can be genuinely confusing. That’s why propaganda works. For instance, many people assume there’s nothing wrong with ANTIFA, because this group of total maniacs has branded itself as “anti-fascist.” What could be wrong with being anti-fascist? Are you pro fascism?</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem with Black Lives Matter—though, happily, unlike ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter actually seems committed to peaceful protest, which is hugely important. So the problem I’m discussing is more ideological, and it’s much bigger than Black Lives Matter—though BLM is its most visible symbol of this movement. The wider issue is that we are in the midst of a public hysteria and moral panic. And it has been made possible by a near total unwillingness, particularly on the Left, among people who value their careers and their livelihoods and their reputations, and fear being hounded into oblivion online—this is nearly everyone left-of-center politically. People are simply refusing to speak honestly about the problem of race and racism in America.</p>
<p>We are making ourselves sick. We are damaging our society. And by protesting the wrong thing, even the slightly wrong thing, and unleashing an explosion of cynical criminality in the process—looting that doesn’t even have the pretense of protest—the Left is empowering Trump, whatever the polls currently show. And if we are worried about Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, as I think we really should be, this is important to understand. He recently had what looked like paramilitary troops guarding the White House. I don’t know if we found out who those guys actually were, but that was genuinely alarming. But how are Democrats calls to “abolish the police” going to play to half the country that just watched so many cities get looted? We have to vote Trump out of office and restore the integrity of our institutions. And we have to make the political case for major reforms to deal with the problem of inequality—a problem which affects the black community most of all.</p>
<p>We need police reform; we need criminal justice reform; we need tax reform; we need health care reform; we need environmental reform—we need all of these things and more. And to be just, these policies will need to reduce the inequality in our society. If we did this, African Americans would benefit, perhaps more than any other group. But it’s not at all clear that progress along these dimensions primarily entails us finding and eradicating more racism in our society.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, what would real progress on the problem of racism look like? What would utter progress look like?</p>
<p>Here’s what I think it would look like: More and more people (and ultimately all people) would care less and less (and ultimately not at all) about race. As I’ve said before in various places, skin color would become like hair color in its political and moral significance—which is to say that it would have none.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you don’t agree with that aspiration. Maybe you think that tribalism based on skin color can’t be outgrown or shouldn’t be outgrown. Well, if you think that, I’m afraid I don’t know what to say to you. It’s not that there’s nothing to say, it’s just there is so much we disagree about, morally and politically, that I don’t know where to begin. So that debate, if it can even be had, will have to be left for another time.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this conversation, I have to assume that you agree with me about the goal here, which is to say that you share the hope that there will come a time where the color of a person’s skin really doesn’t matter. What would that be like?</p>
<p>Well, how many blondes got into Harvard this year? Does anyone know? What percentage of the police in San Diego are brunette? Do we have enough red heads in senior management in our Fortune 500 companies? No one is asking these questions, and there is a reason for that. No one cares. And we are right not to care.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which people cared about hair color to the degree that we currently care—or seem to care, or imagine that others care, or allege that they secretly care—about skin color. Imagine a world in which discrimination by hair color was a thing, and it took centuries to overcome, and it remains a persistent source of private pain and public grievance throughout society, even where it no longer exists. What an insane misuse of human energy that would be. What an absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p>The analogy isn’t perfect, for a variety of reasons, but it’s good enough for us to understand what life would be like if the spell of racism and anti-racism were truly broken. The future we want is not one in which we have all become passionate anti-racists. It’s not a future in which we are forever on our guard against the slightest insult—the bad joke, the awkward compliment, the tweet that didn’t age well. We want to get to a world in which skin color and other superficial characteristics of a person become morally and politically irrelevant. And if you don’t agree with that, what did you think Martin Luther King Jr was talking about?</p>
<p>And, finally, if you’re on the Left and don’t agree with this vision of a post-racial future, please observe that the people who agree with you, the people who believe that there is no overcoming race, and that racial identity is indissoluble, and that skin color really matters and will always matter—these people are white supremacists and neo-Nazis and other total assholes. And these are also people I can’t figure out how to talk to, much less persuade.</p>
<p>So the question for the rest of us—those of us who want to build a world populated by human beings, merely—the question is, how do we get there? How does racial difference become uninteresting? Can it become uninteresting by more and more people taking a greater interest in it? Can it become uninteresting by becoming a permanent political identity? Can it become uninteresting by our having thousands of institutions whose funding (and, therefore, very survival) depends on it remaining interesting until the end of the world?</p>
<p>Can it become less significant by being granted more and more significance? By becoming a fetish, a sacred object, ringed on all sides by taboos? Can race become less significant if you can lose your reputation and even your livelihood, at any moment, by saying one wrong word about it?</p>
<p>I think these questions answer themselves. To outgrow our obsession with racial difference, we have outgrow our obsession with race. And you don’t do that by maintaining your obsession with it.</p>
<p>Now, you might agree with me about the goal and about how a post-racial society would seem, but you might disagree about the path to get there—the question of what to do next. In fact, one podcast listener wrote to me recently to say that while he accepted my notion of a post-racial future, he thinks it’s just far too soon to talk about putting racial politics behind us. He asked me to imagine just how absurd it would have been to tell Martin Luther King Jr, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, that the path beyond racism requires that he become less and less obsessed with race.</p>
<p>That seems like a fair point, but Coleman Hughes has drawn my attention to a string of MLK quotes that seem to be just as transcendent of racial identity politics as I’m hoping to be here. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1087593991976243200?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see these quotations</a> on his Twitter feed. None of those statements by King would make sense coming out of Black Lives Matter at the moment.</p>
<p>In any case, as I said, I think we are living in a very different time than Martin Luther King was. And what I see all around me is evidence of the fact that we were paying an intolerable price for confusion about racism, and social justice generally—and the importance of identity, generally—and this is happening in an environment where the path to success and power for historically disadvantaged groups isn’t generally barred by white racists who won&#8217;t vote for them, or hire them, or celebrate their achievements, or buy their products, and it isn’t generally barred by laws and policies and norms that are unfair. There is surely still some of that. But there must be less of it now than there ever was.</p>
<p>The real burden on the black community is the continued legacy of inequality—with respect to wealth, and education, and health, and social order—levels of crime, in particular, and resulting levels of incarceration, and single-parent families—and it seems very unlikely that these disparities, whatever their origin in the past, can be solved by focusing on problem of lingering racism, especially where it doesn&#8217;t exist. And the current problem of police violence seems a perfect case in point.</p>
<p>And yet now we’re inundated with messages from every well-intentioned company and organization singing from the same book of hymns. Black Lives Matter is everywhere. Of course, black lives matter. But the messaging of this movement about the reality of police violence is wrong, and it’s creating a public hysteria.</p>
<p>I just got a message from the American Association for the Advancement of Science talking about fear of the other. The quote from the email: “Left unchecked, racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of the other can enter any organization or community – and destroy the foundations upon which we must build our future.” Ok, fine. But is that really the concern in the scientific community right now, “unchecked racism, sexism, and homophobia.” Is that really what ails science in the year 2020? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you the fear of the other that does seem warranted, everywhere, right now. It&#8217;s the other who has rendered him or herself incapable of dialogue. It’s the other who will not listen to reason, who has no interest in facts, who can&#8217;t join a conversation that converges on the truth, because he knows in advance what the truth must be. We should fear the other who thinks that dogmatism and cognitive bias aren’t something to be corrected for, because they’re the very foundations of his epistemology.  We should fear the other who can&#8217;t distinguish activism from journalism or politics from science. Or worse, can make these distinctions, but refuses to. And we’re all capable of becoming this person. If only for minutes or hours at a time. And this is a bug in our operating system, not a feature. We have to continually correct for it.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking things that many of us learned when the Covid-19 pandemic was first landing on our shores, and we were weighing the pros and cons of closing the schools, was that for tens of millions of American kids, going to school represents the only guarantee of a decent meal on any given day. I’m pretty confident that most of the kids we’re talking about here aren’t white. And whatever you think about the opportunities in this country and whatever individual success stories you can call to mind, there is no question that some of us start on third base, or second base. Everyone has a lot to deal with, of course. Life is hard. But not everyone is a single mom, or single grandparent, struggling to raise kids in the inner city, all the while trying to keep them from getting murdered. The disparities in our society are absolutely heartbreaking and unacceptable. And we need to have a rational discussion about their actual causes and solutions.</p>
<p>We have to pull back from the brink here. And all we have with which to do that is conversation. And the only thing that makes conversation possible is an openness to evidence and arguments—a willingness to update one’s view of the world when better reasons are given. And that is an ongoing process, not a place we ever finally arrive.</p>
<p>Ok… Well, perhaps that was more of an exhortation than I intended, but it certainly felt like I needed to say it. I hope it was useful. And the conversations will continue on this podcast.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://samharris.org/thoughts-implosion-pangburn-philosophy/">A few thoughts on the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As many of you know, the Day of Reflection conference, scheduled for November 17 in NYC, has been cancelled, and some hundreds of ticket holders are now left seeking refunds.</p>
<p>I was forced to pull out of this event <a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/1043277230632132608">nearly two months ago</a> and have said very little about it since. Now that Travis Pangburn has officially announced that he will be <a href="https://twitter.com/PangburnInspire/status/1062431248205864962">“folding” his touring company</a>, Pangburn Philosophy, I can give a brief account of what happened.</p>
<ol>
<li>I participated in 10 events organized by Pangburn Philosophy between September 2017 and July 2018. I didn’t always approve of the way those events were staged or marketed, but all of them appeared to be successful.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>However, after the cancellation of an August 2018 conference in Auckland, Pangburn seemed intent on running his business off a cliff. He owed a lot of money to several speakers at that point, in the form of unpaid fees and reimbursements. Most egregiously, he seemed less than fully committed to refunding ticket holders for the cancelled Auckland conference.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>At this point, I had two more dates on the calendar with Pangburn in 2018: a dialogue with Brian Greene in Toronto (September 5) and the Day of Reflection conference in New York (November 17). I kept my appointment in Toronto because I was contractually obligated to do so. I also didn’t want to do anything that would harm Pangburn’s ability to pay his mounting debts.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>After Toronto, however, it became clear that Pangburn could not be trusted to put his house in order. Facing a total lack of transparency, and realizing that Pangburn was using my ongoing association with him to book future speakers, I withdrew from the NYC conference on September 21 (as well as from a Vancouver conference scheduled for March 2019). Legally, I was able to do this because Pangburn was in breach of my speaking contract. Ethically, I had a far more compelling reason to back out: I couldn’t promote or participate in an event for which I believed other speakers were unlikely to get paid; nor could I continue to work with someone who still hadn’t given refunds to ticket holders for a conference that had been canceled more than a month before.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>After I withdrew from the NYC conference, my management team asked Pangburn to give us the email addresses of all ticket holders so that we could notify them that I was no longer involved with the event. Pangburn refused to provide this information. However, he assured us that he would notify everyone himself. (I do not know whether he ever did.) He then stopped responding to our emails.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>At the time I pulled out of the NYC conference, I assumed that the revenue from ticket sales was still safely in the box office and that Pangburn would be obliged to issue refunds should the conference fail. That’s how things normally work, especially at a reputable venue like Lincoln Center. It hadn’t occurred to me that New York ticketholders might suffer the same fate as those in Auckland.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>I was left with a legal and ethical puzzle that I could not solve. Again, I had no way to communicate with ticket holders directly, and discussing the chaos surrounding Pangburn on my podcast never seemed like an option. Several friends and colleagues still had events on the calendar with him, and I didn’t want to do anything to derail them. In addition, many speakers who were aware of my reasons for pulling out of the NYC conference were still signed on and seemed intent on making it work. I couldn’t see anything to do that wouldn’t risk creating further harms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Pangburn still owes several speakers (including me) an extraordinary amount of money, we were willing to participate in the NYC conference for free as recently as a few days ago, if he would have handed it over to us and stepped away. I have been told that this offer was made, and he declined it.</p>
<p>I find it appalling that so many people were needlessly harmed by the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy. I can assure you that every speaker associated with the NYC event will be much wiser when working with promoters in the future.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

<blockquote><p>PRESS RELEASE MARCH 12 2013</p>
<p>Catholic Church&#8217;s Rights to &#8220;The Work of God&#8221; Stand Trial</p>
<p>On Friday, presumably immediately after a new Pope has been elected, The Danish High Maritime &amp; Commercial Court of Denmark, will make a historical verdict upon who has the rights to use the age old philosophical &amp; theological concept of &#8220;opus dei&#8221; (The Work of God).</p>
<p>The former Pope&#8217;s personal Prelature has claimed sole rights to the concept since the 1980s, right up until it was inevitably challenged by the small Danish card game publishing house, Dema Games, when they registered (and had officially approved), their trademark: &#8220;Opus-Dei: Existence After Religion&#8221;. A name that has &#8220;everything to do with the philosophical connotations, and nothing to do with the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei&#8221; , Managing Director, Mark Rees-Andersen says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dema Games, and their Pro Bono lawyer Janne Glæsel from the prestigious Copenhagen-based law firm, Gorrissen Federspiel, has chosen to counter-sue the Prelature, which now might lose their rights to their EU-trademark, which due to EU-law, the Danish court has authority to make rulings on behalf of.  The sue was an immediate media security event.  Federspiel was last seen with a team of <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-york-city-guard-services/">event security Manhattan</a> escorting him due to this new law.  In effect, he has his own concierge security service.</p>
<p>Why the sub-division of the Catholic Church may lose their rights, is mainly due to the argument, that the Prelature&#8217;s registration was invalid from the very beginning, as no one can legally monopolize religious concepts. The church has since stepped up security and started<span style="color: #222222;"> monitoring specific or heightened terrorist threats or alerts. Since then a security team from <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration:inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-yorkfire-safety-management/">VIP Protection New York City</a> patrols the outside.  Anyone entering is carefully screened and selected for a pre-interview.</span></p>
<p>The case has been ongoing for four years, and Mark Rees-Andersen has singlehandedly successfully defended his legal rights to his game&#8217;s website in 2009, at Nominet, the authority of domain-rights issues in the UK. Dema Games remains to have ownership of the hyphenated &#8220;opus-dei&#8221; domain, in Denmark, Great Britain, France, Poland, Switzerland, and Sweden.</p>

<p>Best regards / Mvh,</p>
