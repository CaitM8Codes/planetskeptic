<p class="lead"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/11/24/ahmaud-arbery-trial-verdict/">Good news</a> just in time for a too-brief Thanksgiving break.</p>
<blockquote><p>The three White men who chased and killed Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia last year were convicted of murder Wednesday in a case that many saw as a test of racial bias in the justice system.</p>
<p>Travis McMichael, his father, Greg McMichael, and their neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan were found guilty of felony murder in the shooting of Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man. Travis McMichael was also convicted of malice murder, or intent to kill. All three men, who still face federal hate crime charges, could receive life in prison without parole.</p></blockquote>
<p>That whole assault was a horror show, as were the Rittenhouse murders. It&#8217;s exhausting that the law in this country so abjectly panders to armed white men and their sense of entitlement that whether one of them goes to jail after killing someone is a crap shoot. The dice came up for justice this one time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to see my granddaughter tomorrow. Should I bring her one of these? I don&#8217;t really want to see her brought up as a serial killer or a Frankenstein…although it does suggest some cool experiments. If we hook it up to the wall socket, can we make it live?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as vegetarians, neither I nor my daughter have the spare parts to craft one. We&#8217;ve got leeks, and onions, and carrots, and asparagus, and broccoli, and mushrooms, though, and I might be able to concoct a vegan nightmare out of all that.</p>
<p>Alas, the <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/bizarre-chicken-teddy-bear-appears-facebook-marketplace-45860">chicken teddy is fake news</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The raw chicken teddy bear, which went viral for the first time in 2013, is actually a piece of art by Russian artist Viktor Ivanov, who said at the time, &#8220;On the whole, it made me feel disgusted the entire time I was making it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;One should not know what it’s like to sew through skin.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What? I know what it&#8217;s like to sew through skin. I had no idea it was a forbidden art.</p>

<p class="lead">Besides out-generaling the treacherous Confederates and putting down one rebellion that split the country, Grant also was an advocate for an important law after the war: <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/charlotesville-spencer-kessler-trial-spitalnik_n_61730a2ee4b09314320ae288">the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>President Ulysses S. Grant asked for the law after the rise of the KKK following the Civil War, and it was passed within a month with broad support. The law targeted Klan activity, making it illegal to use force, intimidation and threats to prevent people from voting, serving on a jury or testifying in court. The law specifically makes it illegal to “go in disguise upon the public highway or upon the premises of another” and allows victims to sue perpetrators in civil court.</p>
<p>Grant’s administration then used it to almost completely dismantle the KKK in America for years, bleeding them dry with civil suits.</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds like a good law. Maybe we should go after the Republican party with it. But for now, I&#8217;ll settle for the fact that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/11/23/charlottesville-verdict-live-updates/">it&#8217;s being used to dismantle openly Nazi-affiliated groups</a>, like those that rioted in Charlottesville.</p>
<blockquote><p>More than a dozen of the nation’s most prominent white supremacists and hate groups conspired to intimidate, harass or commit acts of violence during 2017′s deadly Unite the Right rally, according to a jury that also decided the men and their racist organizations should pay $26 million in damages.</p>
<p>The 11 jurors couldn’t come to an agreement on two federal conspiracy claims, but they found that every defendant — including former alt-right leader Richard Spencer, rally organizer Jason Kessler and Christopher Cantwell, dubbed the “crying Nazi” after sharing a video of himself weeping — was liable under Virginia law.</p>
<p>“We think that is a resounding verdict today and frankly a good sign for the future on the remaining counts,” plaintiffs attorney Karen Dunn said, referring to the allegations that the men conspired to commit racially motivated violence and failed to stop it — accusations her clients might pursue again in a future lawsuit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Twenty six million dollars. $26,000,000. That&#8217;s got to sting, and there&#8217;s the threat of further suits. Good work, Ulysses.</p>
<p>The lawyers who accomplished this worked hard and made personal sacrifices to corner these rats and bring them to justice, so good for them, too. When lawyers and judges fail, we get results like we&#8217;ve seen recently, with murderers walking free. This group did not slack in their duties.</p>
<blockquote><p>They can’t think about what will happen if they aren’t successful. They see this case as not about one incident, but about all right-wing violence in America. Unchecked, we end up with more events like Charlottesville, and like the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>So, it’s all on the line: democracy, the ability of people to live without fear.</p>
<p>Plus, Spitalnick pointed out that they’ve already made it harder to be a Nazi in America ― or, at least, more expensive. Spencer has no attorney because he’s out of money. Defendants can’t raise money because they’ve been deplatformed from fundraising sites. White supremacist group Vanguard America has been ordered to pay $16,000 for disobeying court orders in the case.</p>
<p>It’s a slow bleed of access and money until what was once the dapper face of terror, illuminated in fire, is revealed for what it always has been: nothing more than hatred.</p></blockquote>
<p>So raise a glass to President Grant on Thanksgiving Day. His legacy lives on.</p>

(ILO/Benoit Marquet/Creative Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-_33_.jpg" height="912" alt="Screenshot-_33_" width="1388" /></p> <p>Of the many offensive &ldquo;-isms&rdquo; we see and hear about every day, &ldquo;accentism&rdquo; rarely gets a mention. After all, for many of us, different accents are part and parcel of daily interaction. Yet research has shown that unconscious bias is prompted by accents in much the same way that it is by sex or skin colour. People who sound different are assigned certain cultural traits or grouped into particular social classes, which together provide fuel for prejudices. When it comes to our perceptions of the speaker, this impacts on our most fickle of human feelings: trust and confidence.</p> <p>But what might happen if technology was developed that enabled people in all corners of the globe to sound more or less similar? Sanas, a Silicon Valley-based start-up that bills itself as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s first solution for real-time accent matching&rdquo;, has taken steps towards this. With its technology, a person in the Philippines speaking over the phone to someone in the US will sound American; or to someone in Spain, Spanish &ndash; whatever accent it is that the company&rsquo;s AI-powered programme &ldquo;hears&rdquo; at the other end of the line.</p> <p>Started by people of Russian, Chinese and Spanish-speaking backgrounds, Sanas explains on its website that the concept came about via the difficulties its founders experienced in understanding one another. It is now being tested in call centres, and perhaps for good reason: a frustrated caller seeking expert help with a faulty product is likely to be frustrated even further if they can&rsquo;t understand the instructions being given over the phone. Sanas wants to help everyone to &ldquo;understand and be understood&rdquo;.</p> <p>But while the technology will no doubt make communication between a call centre worker and an angry customer less fraught, does it risk fuelling a homogenisation of accents, if not worse &ndash; the feeding of a sense that &ldquo;western&rdquo; accents are to be trusted more? A number of the largest UK and US companies have outsourced their call centres to India, the Philippines and other countries where labour is abundant and cheap. Those call centres are serving millions of customers in Europe and North America for whom ease and convenience, rather than cultural exchange and learning, are the highest priorities. But the distinctiveness of the accents of staff &ndash; the intonations and the musicality; the histories that lie behind their dialects &ndash; will be gone if such technology is widely adopted.</p> <p>Cross-cultural communication brings many benefits. But it would be no bad thing to remember that in the process of making communication between different peoples of the world easier, much can be lost.<br /><br /><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

But as <strong>Cal Flyn</strong> discovers, techniques are being developed that allow dogs to seemingly understand vocabulary and grammar.</p> <blockquote>We may never know if the dogs are using and comprehending human language to mean exactly the same as we do. But if nothing else, it gives us a great deal of insight into our relationship with them as a species, their concerns and their personalities.</blockquote> <p><strong>How to build an animal </strong></p> <p>DNA provides the blueprint for our bodies, but something else determines how we are actually constructed. <strong>Peter Forbes</strong> on the molecules that make us who we are.</p> <blockquote>Given that we always start from a single living cell, let&rsquo;s pose what seems a manageable question: how do animals acquire four limbs and their attached appendages?</blockquote> <p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p> <p>JP O'Malley speaks with <strong>Eimear McBride</strong>, author of <em>A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, The Lesser Bohemians </em>and more.</p> <blockquote>Men&rsquo;s bodies [in our culture] are not seen as meat, but flesh, almost divine, separate and set apart.

But it can also be extremely useful. We use it to package salad leaves, fizz our soft drinks, render animals unconscious before they are slaughtered, and more.</p> <p class="p1">Yet much of Europe has lately been suffering from a CO₂ shortage &ndash; ironic, given that it&rsquo;s in the air. An obvious question has therefore arisen: why don&rsquo;t we pull it directly out of the air? The answer is that CO₂ only makes up 0.04 per cent of our air, and is therefore difficult to extract directly. The research into carbon (dioxide) capture as a means of countering CO₂ emissions has not yet produced a technique that'll extract the quantities needed to support the gas industry. Instead, the main source of CO₂ for industry is a by-product of nitrogen-based fertiliser production. This industry is also heavily reliant on natural gas, so when the gas prices climbed this autumn, fertiliser plants shut down to save on costs. The knock-on <br />effect was a shortage in CO₂.</p> <p class="p1">Nitrogen plays a critical role in the biochemistry of every living thing. It is also the most common gas in our atmosphere. But it is largely inert, which means plants and animals can&rsquo;t extract it from the air. Consequently, a major limiting factor in agriculture has always been bio-available nitrogen.</p> <p class="p1">Most nitrogen fertilisers are produced via the Haber-Bosch process. This combines nitrogen from the air with hydrogen gas to create ammonia. Hydrogen gas is less easy to source than nitrogen. There&rsquo;s plenty of hydrogen about, most obviously as the H in H₂O and CH₄ (methane), but breaking the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen in water, or carbon in methane, requires a huge amount of energy. Hydrogen gas is therefore mainly produced by methane steam reforming, where natural gas and water is heated to about 1,000<span class="s1">℃</span>. The end products are hydrogen gas and CO₂. These can then be separated for their respective uses: the hydrogen into fertiliser, and the carbon dioxide into your salad bags.</p> <p class="p1">So, until carbon capture technology matures, the cost of the fizz in your cola will likely remain tied to the price of natural gas and fertilisers.</p> <p class="p1"><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Acceptance there, we&rsquo;re told, indicates a universal admiration, if not envy, of &ldquo;our&rdquo; brand of humour. Chief among recent successes in the US is <em>Fleabag</em>, which in 2019 became the first British production to win best comedy series at the Emmy Awards.</p> <p>But in September, the show became cause for some mild cognitive dissonance in Westminster. Outgoing minister for media John Whittingdale cited the strain of &ldquo;sarcasm&rdquo; running through <em>Fleabag</em> as evidence that it &ldquo;could only have been made in the UK&rdquo;; other comedy-dramas, like <em>Blackadder</em>, had a &ldquo;dash of restraint&rdquo; that was &ldquo;classically British&rdquo;. With broadcasters now receiving more money for dramas from overseas investors, a trend that risked diluting the concentration of &ldquo;Britishness&rdquo; on our screens, it was vital, the minister argued, that such shows continued to be made. In fact, broadcasters would henceforth be required to produce &ldquo;distinctively British&rdquo; content.</p> <p>Cue much criticism in response. But it spoke to a larger question: can humour ever be particular to one society or culture? If so, how can it be so rapturously received by another, especially when that &ldquo;other&rdquo; is a nation often stereotyped as lacking in the fine arts of sarcasm? In a country boasting a kaleidoscope of different cultural traditions &ndash; regional, ethnic, class-based and more &ndash; should we even humour such a notion as &ldquo;distinctively British&rdquo;?</p> <p>The current UK government has done much to frame &ldquo;Britishness&rdquo; as both imperilled by outsiders and something the rest of the world would do well to learn from. For Whittingdale, radio, film and television can amplify the &ldquo;unique identity&rdquo; of British output, and in the process, show the glut of foreign shows that &ldquo;have no real identity, no genuine sense of place&rdquo; for what they are.<br /><br />Most admirers of <em>Fleabag</em> will have marvelled at the economy of the writing or at its masterly marriage of pathos and wit. That Whittingdale&rsquo;s thoughts moved straight to empire building 2.0 reveals something about how the current government sees cultural output as a tool for securing global envy of Britain. Our scriptwriters can package up the constellation of traditions, attitudes, behaviours and otherwise that make up &ldquo;Britishness&rdquo; into half-hour episodes and project them in such a way that the world understands we have something no one else does.</p> <p>But in arguing for a &ldquo;distinctively British&rdquo; sense of humour, Whittingdale undermines the creative ingenuity of the scriptwriters he claims to celebrate. In his view, their material is somehow a product of the nation, while the individual influences they channel play second fiddle.</p> <p>Of course, for a government afraid of its nation&rsquo;s diminishing global status, that kind of story can be useful to tell. But it won&rsquo;t find much of an audience among the creators it claims to celebrate.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. </em><a href="/supportus"><span class="s2"><em>Subscribe today</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

They're all made up of many components, interacting with a touch of randomness and a dash of disorder: the recipe for a complex system. The last two ingredients &ndash; randomness and disorder &ndash; make their behaviour extremely difficult to model and predict.</p> <p>But physicists do enjoy a challenge, and in the 1960s Syukuro Manabe sought to model one such system: energy transfer and transport within the Earth&rsquo;s climate. Manabe&rsquo;s work was the first to explore the interplay between the greenhouse gas effect, the rising of hot air due to convection and the heat released when clouds form. It demonstrated that increasing carbon dioxide leads to rising temperatures closer to the ground, with the upper atmosphere becoming colder. Most strikingly, he showed that doubling the carbon dioxide concentration in the air caused an increase in Earth surface temperature of 2℃. This work seeded the climate change models we have today.</p> <p>A decade later, Klaus Hasselmann took Manabe&rsquo;s work a step further by incorporating the chaos of weather into climate modelling in order to make predictions over time. To represent the rapidly changing weather conditions in the atmosphere, he mathematically built in chance to the model. This paved the way to proving anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are behind today&rsquo;s global warming.</p> <p>For these breakthroughs, Manabe and Hasselmann have been awarded one half of this year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize in Physics. The other half has gone to Giorgio Parisi, whose dedication to understanding disordered and complex materials led to revelations of hidden patterns in the mathematics that could be used to harness predictability in a wide range of complex disordered scenarios, from neuroscience to machine learning, and in the mesmerising sight of a flock of starlings forming a living abstract artwork across the sky.</p> <p>Predicting the unpredictable sounds like a Nobel Prize-worthy achievement. And now it officially is.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. </em><a href="/supportus"><span class="s2"><em>Subscribe today</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
