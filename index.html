<p class="lead"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/california-man-arrested-and-charged-making-threats-against-lgbtq-community">Jeremy David Hanson has been arrested</a>. His crime? He threatened to murder a dictionary.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the criminal complaint, between Oct. 2 and Oct. 8, 2021, Springfield-based Merriam-Webster, Inc. received various threatening messages and comments demonstrating bias against specific gender identities submitted through its website’s “Contact Us” page and in the comments section on its webpages that corresponded to the word entries for “Girl” and “Woman.” Authorities later identified the user as Hanson. As a result of the threats, Merriam-Webster closed its offices in Springfield and New York City for approximately five business days.</p>
<p>Specifically, it is alleged that on Oct. 2, 2021, Hanson used the handle “@anonYmous” to post the following comment on the dictionary’s website definition of “female”: “It is absolutely sickening that Merriam-Webster now tells blatant lies and promotes anti-science propaganda. There is no such thing as ‘gender identity.’ The imbecile who wrote this entry should be hunted down and shot.”</p>
<p>Hanson also allegedly sent the following threatening message via the website’s “Contact Us” page: “You [sic] headquarters should be shot up and bombed. It is sickening that you have caved to the cultural Marxist, anti-science tranny [sic] agenda and altered the definition of ‘female’ as part of the Left’s efforts to corrupt and degrade the English language and deny reality. You evil Marxists should all be killed. It would be poetic justice to have someone storm your offices and shoot up the place, leaving none of you commies alive.”</p>
<p>It is further alleged that on Oct. 8, 2021, Hanson posted another threatening comment on the dictionary’s website and a threatening message via the “Contact Us” page that threatened to “bomb your offices for lying and creating fake…”. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is where gender-critical fanaticism takes you. They&#8217;ve convinced themselves that science is anti-science and reject the actual understanding of science to claim an authority they don&#8217;t have. There is most definitely such a thing as gender identity &#8212; I suspect that Hanson identifies very strongly as a man.</p>
<p>So now he wants to kill people because he thinks dictionary definitions are powerful and magical and that, rather than describing how people use words,  they actually create the meaning. Somebody needs to explain that murdering dictionary writers won&#8217;t change the meaning of words. I don&#8217;t think the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/female">Merriam-Webster dictionary entry</a> is particularly comprehensive or thorough, but I don&#8217;t think that bombing offices will affect how people understand &#8220;female&#8221;.</p>

Image: Mike Norton" width="1600" /></p> <p>Journalist Ed Vulliamy once noted that &ldquo;within 20 years of the liberation of Dachau&hellip; the Beatles were playing Hamburg&rdquo;. No such thawing of relations or moving-on has meaningfully taken place in the Balkan region. There is still an urgent need for reconciliation. Meanwhile, a whole generation have grown up in the long shadow of the war, hearing three rival nationalist narratives from respective governments. To this day, the government in Serbia refuses to recognise that the massacre of 8,000 Bosnia Muslim (or Bosniak) boys and men in the town of Srebrenica in 1992 constitutes genocide.</p> <p>Why has transitional justice proved so challenging in the Balkans? On the face of it, there seems to be progress. The final two criminal cases related to the Yugoslav wars were concluded last year by the international court in the Hague. However, the process of pursuing justice at a local level has largely stalled, with many cases yet to be heard. Meanwhile, nationalist politicians have sought to undermine the institutions of Bosnia and dismember the state. Still, there are people and organisations working to pursue transitional justice in the region, holding perpetrators to account and attempting a measure of reconciliation between groups on different sides of the conflicts. How can the region move on from the current reality of frozen conflict?</p> <h2>The first war crimes court since Nuremberg</h2> <p>The reconciliation process had once been geared around the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, set up in 1993 by the UN to prosecute war crimes committed in the region. It later spread to the whole region, including Kosovo. The court operated for twenty-four years, indicting 161 people, conducting 111 trials, and convicting 90 people from all sides of the conflict &ndash; including the first sitting head of a state to be indicted for war crimes, Slobodan Milosevic. In many ways it was ground-breaking. The first war crimes court to be established since the end of the Second World War, it issued important judgements on rape as a weapon of war.</p> <p>David Tolbert worked at the court on and off for nine years, starting as a senior legal officer. While many people looked back to the Nuremberg Trials as an antecedent, he feels that the ICTY was &ldquo;the first of its kind&rdquo;. He is positive about the record of the court, which indicted a larger number of people and accounted for all of them, when comparable efforts at justice in countries such as Rwanda and Cambodia have struggled. The prosecutors were facilitated by political will to make arrests and were also able to make links between some of the defendants where they had been working together to commit crimes.</p> <p><img title="The ICTY building, The Hague" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/ICTY_Building,_The_Hague.jpg" height="867" alt="ICTY building, The Hague" width="1417" /></p> <p>But the court also faced challenges and attracted criticism from all sides. Securing the support of national governments was a significant block, especially early on. &ldquo;In Serbia the cooperation was really difficult and also in Republic Srpska [the majority Serb areas in Bosnia],&rdquo; says Tolbert, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where we really needed political support from NATO and the NATO countries.&rdquo; That support did come, with NATO troops making arrests and transferring a suspected war criminal to the ICTJ. Tolbert feels the court improved over time in terms of dealing with this political engagement and in helping make arrests. He noted that there was a &ldquo;pretty big learning curve&rdquo; for those involved to begin to understand the context, and then to create the mechanisms to make arrests and gather evidence, given that the ICTY was an international court and those involved mostly came from outside the region.</p> <p>The court also made its own blunders. One of the most emotive was the loss of personal belongings of Srebrenica victims. Originally removed from mass grave sites in 1996-97, these items were destroyed in 2009 on the grounds they had started to decompose. They included documents and photos that could help identify the remains of victims. The convoluted and opaque system that allowed this to happen without the prior knowledge of victims&rsquo; groups and families underlined the failures of trust and communication. The ICTY finally closed its doors in 2017, leaving a mixed legacy and a handful of cases to finish.</p> <h2>Failing survivors?</h2> <p>A year later, the Balkans Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) published a report into the state of transitional justice in the region. &ldquo;Accountability, truth and justice still seem more like ideals than reality,&rdquo; the report said, going on to set out how prosecutions by national governments had fallen, regional cooperation had collapsed, and victims and survivors had been &ldquo;betrayed&rdquo;. For example, the report noted that while there had been 3,500 prosecutions in Croatia, just 119 were against Croatian soldiers, and their sentences were lower than for people from other ethnicities for the same categories of crimes. While the ICTY did set those ground-breaking precedents on rape as a weapon of war, a recent survey of survivors found a majority of survivors felt abandoned by the civil justice system because it is very difficult for them to claim compensation.</p> <p>The ICTY is now seen by many as a failure. Rather than bringing closure to victims, or paving the way for societal-level reconciliation, they see the court as having amplified the voices of wartime leaders. While many such leaders were prosecuted, their trials gave them the platform and space to pontificate and propagate their ultranationalist ideologies.</p> <p>Perhaps the most surreal example of this was the infamous suicide of Slobodan Praljak in the Hague court. A former Bosnian Croat general, Praljac had been found guilty of committing violations of the laws of war, crimes against humanity, and breaches of the Geneva Convention. On hearing the guilty verdict in 2017, he swallowed cyanide in the courtroom. The act somewhat grotesquely became an internet meme in the late 2010s to characterise an excessive emotional reaction to a situation ("excuse me while I drink my poison").</p> <p>The later acquittal of Serb leader Vojislav Seselj &ndash; who had been charged with incitement of torture, murder, forcible deportations and persecution on religious and racial grounds, but was found to have had had no military &ldquo;hierarchical responsibility&rdquo; &ndash; was for many anti-nationalist campaigners in the region the death knell of the ICTY&rsquo;s legitimacy. Seselj received and was quickly rehabilitated by the Serbian political establishment.</p> <p><img title="Vojislav Seselji on TV Kopernikus, 2018" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Snezana_Djordjevic_i_Vojislav_Seselj.jpg" height="900" alt="Vojislav &Scaron;e&scaron;elj" width="1600" /></p> <p>Meanwhile, in the absence of meaningful and effective transitional justice in the region, society continues to be divided along ethnic lines. The starkest example is Bosnia, a multi-ethnic state of Bosniaks (or, as many prefer to be called, Bosnian Muslims), Croats and Serbs. While schools in the country nominally promote &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; values, in practice they are ethnically and linguistically segregated, meaning three very different versions of history are being taught. This not only reinforces those ethno-nationalist discourses, but has made it more challenging for those children and young people, to process the pasts and their sense of who they are and where they belong. Many of the Bosnia-wide institutions, such as public broadcasting and sports, that might have contributed to a sense of national unity beyond ethnic divides, have been undermined over the years by a persistent campaign from Serb and Croat separatists. Nor are the tensions confined to Bosnia.</p> <h2>Transitional justice from the grassroots</h2> <p>What might the future hold for the region&rsquo;s &ldquo;frozen conflict&rdquo;? Despite the failures of the ICTY and other &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; efforts, some remarkable people and organisations have stepped up at the grassroots. One of the earliest bodies to pursue transitional justice, the Humanitarian Law Centre, was founded in the early stages of the conflicts in 1992. The HLC has played a significant role in Balkan civil society over the last three decade, both tirelessly documenting the Milosevic-era war crimes and human rights violations committed in the 1992-1995 conflict, predominantly against Croats and Bosnian Muslims, and, simultaneously, collecting evidence &ndash; with a view to both prosecutions and societal-level "truth-telling" &ndash; of war crimes and human rights violations in the 1999 conflict in Kosovo.</p> <p>HLC&rsquo;s work in Kosovo is crucial, as many other Serbian human rights organisations would still rather not engage in the country. The idea that "Kosovo is Serbia" still holds sway among sections of Serbian society steeped in the mythologised narrative of the 1389 Field of Blackbirds battle and glorified in the poetry of the nineteenth-century Serb Orthodox/ Montegrin poet Njegos, and the claim was arguably the most central tenet of Milosevic&rsquo;s ultranationalist ideology, from whence all other racist and exclusivist positions emanated.</p> <p>HLC&rsquo;s founder, Natasha Kandic, has been the subject of dozens of lawsuits from Serbian public officials during the past 25 years as a result of her public criticism and work on Serbia&rsquo;s war crimes, documenting atrocities committed in both 1992-1995 in Bosnia and Croatia, and 1999 in Kosovo. It was Kandic who provided what is considered the &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; for Serbia&rsquo;s involvement in the Srebrenica Massacre: a video of Serbian soldiers from the Skorpions Unit executing six Bosnian Muslim prisoners. The video, presented as evidence to the ICTY, was also partially broadcast on Serbian and Bosnian TV. She continues to be a key figure across the human rights and transitional justice movement in the former Yugoslavia.</p> <p>Kandic also spearheaded the RECOM initiative, which in 2008 initiated the creation of a regional &ldquo;peace commission for the people&rdquo;, focusing on documenting war crimes along with truth-telling and processing the past through public initiatives. The aim was that this documentation of war crimes committed by "all sides" in the 1990s would be used to secure prosecution. RECOM made significant breakthroughs, not only in presenting an alternative to the one-sided narratives and ultranationalist rhetoric of leading political parties in Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, but also in helping to mobilise and coordinate progressive and pro-human rights actors across all countries in the region.</p> <p>RECOM&rsquo;s work spoke to the need articulated by anti-nationalist, feminist Croatian writer Slavenka Drakulic to bridge the chasm "between official history and collective memory", as a necessary stage of societal-level healing. Its work dovetailed with the Croatian-based initiative, Dokumenta, an organisation formed in 2004 with the aim of investigating and establishing truth so as to create a &ldquo;sustainable peace by dealing with the past.&rdquo;</p> <p>The emergence of these independent bodies in the late 2000s thus seemed to many progressive activists and academics in the region a tonic to the toxic legacies of the 1990s war that had begun to appear in the election of ultranationalists and the routine denial of facts (even when, as in the case of the 1995 genocide in Srebrenica, such facts had been established both in the ICTY and other international courts).</p> <p>Both RECOM and Dokumenta speak to a need for shared narratives, whether these emerge through trials or through truth-telling. As Bosnian filmmaker Jasmila Zbanic illustrated through her 2010 film <em>For Those Who Can Tell No Tales</em>, about what she calls the &ldquo;endangered&rdquo; memory of the Visegrad massacre, there is no justice without truth and no truth without justice. She recently won an Oscar for <em>Quo Vadis, Aida</em> her exploration of collective memory and Srebrenica.</p> <p><img title="Still from the film " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Quo_vadis__Aida_Film_Still_2.jpg" height="844" alt="Still from Quo Vadis, Aida" width="1500" /></p> <p>Yet, as RECOM representatives noted in an interview with us, these initiatives stand little chance of shifting from shared recognition of the facts to securing prosecutorial victories, in the face of the continued damage of ultranationalism in party politics. As they note: &ldquo;Unfortunately, the situation in the region is very discouraging: number of war crime trials has been decreased; there are no indictments against high-ranked military and police officers; only judgments condemning members of other ethnic communities.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Learning from the past</h2> <p>The tireless and painstaking work of documenting what actually happened during the conflict &ndash; who did what to whom and when &ndash; is both specific to the nature of the atrocities of the former Yugoslavia, and central to the development of what "transitional justice" as a whole can mean. Transitional justice, as a concept and practice, originally emerged out of the South American experiences of authoritarianism in the 1970s. The "right to know" emerged out of South America - and in particular Chile&rsquo;s attempts to deal with the legacy of the Pinochet regime &ndash; as the assertion by families that they, literally, had a right to know where "disappeared" loved ones were buried.</p> <p>In practice, "transitional justice" quickly developed a binary. There was "truth and reconciliation" without prosecution on the one hand, such as the societal-level initiatives of post-apartheid South Africa. On the other hand, there was "prosecutorial justice",<strong> </strong>such as the formal legal spaces of the ICTY and ICTR (the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda).</p> <p>The last decade has seen a new "wave" of transitional justice in the wake of the 2011 Arab revolutions, and in fora such as the Tunisian Truth and Dignity Commission, a national organisation to process the authoritarian past of pre-2011 Tunisia. This new wave, and other national attempts to process the injustices of the past, owe the ICTY a debt of thanks for the paradigms they developed. However, is notable that those involved chose to combine the prosecutorial model of the ICTY with learning from South Africa&rsquo;s reconciliatory experience of "processing the past". This suggests that it isn&rsquo;t that the ICTY was a failure, but rather that it was "necessary but not sufficient" for the people of the region to gain closure from the horrors of the 1990s.</p> <p>Bodies like RECOM and Dokumenta are effective where they work in tandem with the "official" transitional justice processes, such as the work that was undertaken at the ICTY. As RECOM said to us: &ldquo;The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was crucial for judicially established facts that should serve as a basis for the establishment of the rule of law through domestic war crime trials. The RECOM Reconciliation Network as most trustworthy and credible actor of regional reconciliation is establishing a regional record of all the victims regardless of their ethnicity, despite the absence of political support&rdquo;, using the ICTY judgments as the basis of their work.&rdquo;</p> <p>In some sense, the greatest "victory" of the former Yugoslavia&rsquo;s war-time victims in securing formal and structural change and recognition is a victory that has protected others who have suffered in subsequent conflicts &ndash; that of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, which was adopted unanimously in 2000, and acknowledges the disproportionate and unique impact of armed conflict on women and girls, and provided the legal basis to prosecute war-time rape as a weapon of war. Securing Resolution 1325 remains an astonishing victory secured in large part through the work of Bosnian women's rights activists and NGOs.</p> <p>&ldquo;Prosecutions are important, particularly of senior leaders, military and political leaders, but I think a whole lot more needs to be done and that hasn&rsquo;t happened,&rdquo; says David Tolbert. &ldquo;I would have wanted to have seen more transitional justice approaches.&rdquo; Those could have included a truth commission, reparations, a lot of reforms, and political realignment. While he said there were discussions about a truth commission in Serbia, it was unclear whether they were serious. In the generation since the end of the wars of the former Yugoslavia, as Afghanistan and Iraq reformulated the concept of "humanitarian intervention" in the 2000s, and the Arab Revolutions and Euromaidan in Ukraine offered new modes and templates of how to "process the past" after an end of authoritarianism, the ICTY&rsquo;s legacy, and the lessons it offers transitional justice processes that have followed it, remains a bridge &ndash; towards justice, but not there yet.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Right now, I&#8217;m mainly anticipating wrapping up this year, but I&#8217;m also advising first year students, and have visited with prospective students. They fall into two general categories: 1) the absolutely certain who know exactly where they&#8217;re going (lots of pre-meds in this group), and 2) the ones who have no idea, and are worried that they&#8217;re supposed to have their whole life planned out by now. I tell (1) to embrace change, find what you love, and do that. I tell (2) that nobody knows what they&#8217;re doing, we all wing it as we go along, and have fun finding out where life is going to take you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as if I ever knew what I was doing. I&#8217;m 65 and still looking forward to surprises.</p>

It says that there is no sharp division between us, with our rich mental lives, and the rest of the world. Our minds are just complex forms of something that is present everywhere, and the whole universe &ndash; mountains, clouds, asteroids, dust &ndash; is infused with mental life. It is a beguiling view, which has appealed not only to poets and mystics but also to those seeking to understand the place of mind in the natural world. Many philosophers, from ancient times through to the early 20th century, have endorsed a version of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The view fell out of fashion in the mid-20th century as philosophers increasingly adopted a materialist outlook, which identifies minds with functioning brains. In recent years, however, panpsychism has undergone a philosophical renaissance, and it is now presented at major conferences and debated in mainstream journals. The contemporary form is somewhat different from older versions. It concerns only one aspect of the mind &ndash; consciousness &ndash; and it focuses on the presence of this aspect at the fundamental physical level.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Modern panpsychists hold that elementary particles such as electrons and quarks have simple forms of consciousness, and thus that everything in the universe is constructed from conscious elements. They claim that complex forms of consciousness in humans and other animals are built up from the simple consciousnesses of the particles that compose their bodies. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>If all this sounds like woo-woo to you, then you&rsquo;ll find plenty of philosophers who agree. In a Twitter exchange, the Canadian neurophilosopher Patricia Churchland remarked that panpsychism is the consequence of knowing next to no science and asked, &ldquo;What about Pixie dust? Leprechauns? Ghosts?&rdquo; Yet panpsychists are not simply cranks. Some neuroscientists have proposed similar views, and one of the leading panpsychists, the British philosopher Philip Goff, has hailed the theory as providing the foundations for a new science of consciousness. So let&rsquo;s look at the case for panpsychism.</p> <h2 class="p4">The ghost in the machine</h2> <p class="p5">Most contemporary philosophers agree that the mind is not something distinct from the brain. There is no ghost in the machine, as the philosopher Gilbert Ryle put it. Rather, talking about the mind is just a different way of talking about the brain and what it does. The idea is that brains are complex control systems that process sensory signals and use the information to regulate behaviour. When we talk about mental states, such as experiences and thoughts, we are referring to states of these control systems, defined by the role they play within them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Take the experience of smelling a rose. This is a state of the brain (a pattern of activation in certain brain regions) that is caused by a characteristic pattern of signals from receptor cells in the nose and carries information about the presence of roses. It also has a characteristic pattern of effects on other brain systems, producing rose-related memories, associations, beliefs, desires and other psychological reactions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>It is this distinctive pattern of causes and effects that makes it the experience it is &ndash; smelling a rose, rather than seeing a blue sky or feeling dizzy. Every experience has its own distinctive profile of causes and effects, as does every other mental state. This view is known as functionalism, since it says that mental states are defined by the function they perform, rather than by the stuff they are made of, and it has been the dominant view in philosophy of mind since the 1970s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Now, consciousness can also be thought of in this functionalist way. Not all mental states are conscious. Our brains continually register and use sensory information subliminally. Your olfactory system might detect a faint rose scent in the air and trigger a childhood memory of your grandmother&rsquo;s garden without your being consciously aware of having smelt anything. Sensory information is conscious only when it has the right effects on the rest of the system. According to one account, this involves the information being &ldquo;globally broadcast&rdquo; to a range of higher mental systems, including ones for reasoning, decision-making, language, memory and emotion. When this happens, you &ndash; the organism composed of all these brain systems &ndash; can use the information flexibly, thinking about it, reporting it, recalling it and so on.</p> <h2 class="p4">How does it make you feel?</h2> <p class="p5">From this perspective, consciousness is just another aspect of brain functioning: global information sharing. The American philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett speaks of it as &ldquo;fame in the brain&rdquo;. But is that all there is to consciousness? Some philosophers say it is not. For the functionalist account seems to miss out something important &ndash; the essence of consciousness, its subjective dimension. Information sharing in the brain may be the objective, public side of experience, which can be described by neuroscientists. But, these philosophers argue, there is also a subjective, private side to it &ndash; what it is like for the creature undergoing it; how it feels on the inside.<br /><br />Take pain, for example. Functionalism says that pain is a state of the brain that is produced by stimulation of pain receptors, carries information about bodily damage and produces a range of reactions, both psychological (trauma-related emotions, thoughts, desires and memories) and behavioural (wincing, crying, complaining).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>But, the critics say, there is more to pain. There is the actual feel of it, the painfulness; what it&rsquo;s like to be in pain. This seems to be distinct from the processes mentioned in the functionalist account. We could imagine all those processes occurring &ndash; in a robot, perhaps &ndash; without there being any subjective feeling at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>This subjective feel isn&rsquo;t a matter of what the brain state does, but of what it is like in itself, intrinsically, apart from all its causes and effects, and it is wholly private. With suitable instruments, neuroscientists could detect all the effects a pain state has in your brain, but they could never access its subjective feel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Similarly for all other conscious experiences: seeing, hearing, tasting and so on. These are brain states which encode information and make it available to other brain systems, but (so goes the argument) they also have an intrinsic feel to them: what it&rsquo;s like to see a sunset, hear birdsong, taste lemon juice and so on. Philosophers refer to this intrinsic &ldquo;what-it-is-likeness&rdquo; of experience as its phenomenal feel.</p> <h2 class="p4">Solving the "hard problem"</h2> <p class="p5">So, we have two different conceptions of consciousness: an objective functional one (often called access consciousness) and a subjective phenomenal one (phenomenal consciousness). As we have seen, the functional form is not particularly mysterious. But phenomenal consciousness is another matter. How does a brain state come to have a subjective aspect, an intrinsic phenomenal feel, undetectable from the outside? There may not be a ghost in the machine, but there seems to be some ghostliness in it all the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>This problem was given particularly forceful presentation in the mid-1990s by the Australian philosopher David Chalmers, who famously dubbed it the &ldquo;hard problem of consciousness&rdquo; (as opposed to the easy problems of explaining access consciousness).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Many theories of phenomenal consciousness have been proposed, but all have serious weaknesses. Some seek to explain phenomenal feel in terms of properties of the brain, which is implausible, while others hold that there are basic laws of nature linking brain states with phenomenal feels, which seems arbitrary. It is this history of failure that has inspired some researchers to turn to panpsychism.</p> <p class="p5">Panpsychists point out that, in general, complex things are built up out of simpler ones. Brain states are complex structures built out of elementary particles. The phenomenal feels of these brain states (the way they feel to the person whose brain it is) are also complex, so isn&rsquo;t it plausible that these, too, are built out of simpler elements?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The most elegant view, panpsychists argue, is that elementary particles themselves have a very basic kind of phenomenal feel, and that the rich phenomenal feels of our brain states result from combining the feels of the particles that compose them. This is more plausible, they argue, than supposing that rich forms of phenomenal consciousness pop into existence fully formed in the brains of living creatures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Of course, panpsychists don&rsquo;t claim that elementary particles are conscious in the functional sense; they don&rsquo;t think electrons have tiny brains which process sensory information and use it to control their behaviour. They claim only that particles have a basic kind of phenomenal consciousness &ndash; an intrinsic phenomenal feel. And this does seem conceivable. A thing need not do anything in order to have an intrinsic aspect; it just has to exist, and elementary particles do that all right.<br /><br />There is another consideration in favour of this view, which many see as a clincher. It comes from reflection on physics itself. Physics aims to describe the basic constituents of the universe, such as electrons and quarks. But, panpsychists point out, it doesn&rsquo;t tell us what these things are, only how they behave. It describes them as having mass and charge and so on, but this is merely a way of describing how they interact with other particles and forces. (Mass, for example, is a disposition to resist acceleration.) We don&rsquo;t know what the fundamental particles are like in themselves, intrinsically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Here, panpsychists say, is where consciousness comes in. For, they say, we do know the intrinsic nature of one aspect of physical reality: the bit inside our own skulls. When we attend to our experiences, we are directly aware of what our brain states are like in themselves, intrinsically, apart from all the effects they have. Panpsychists take this as a model for the intrinsic nature of physical things generally. Our best hypothesis, they say, is that electrons, quarks and other elementary particles are really tiny blobs of phenomenal feel: micro-consciousnesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>We arrive at the following picture. Elementary particles are actually micro-consciousnesses. They behave in the way physics describes, and they interact and combine to create all the complex physical structures in the universe, including brains. In parallel, their phenomenal feels combine to create the complex phenomenal feels brains possess. It&rsquo;s a neat story, which not only solves the &ldquo;hard problem&rdquo; but also explains what the intrinsic nature of matter is. What&rsquo;s not to like?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>A lot, actually. For one thing, not all philosophers agree that elementary particles must have an intrinsic nature of some kind. Some think that physics tells us all there is to know about them. But let&rsquo;s set that aside and focus on the panpsychist picture itself.</p> <h2 class="p4">Inside the human brain</h2> <p class="p5">Panpsychists acknowledge that their view faces problems. The most discussed of these is the combination problem. How do the trillions of micro-consciousnesses in my brain combine to form my consciousness? Can we even make sense of the idea of distinct consciousnesses fusing together? Since we have no idea what the consciousness of particles is like <span class="s1">(</span>only the particles know!<span class="s1">)</span> and we know nothing of the method by which they combine, we&rsquo;re totally in the dark here. As the philosopher Yujin Nagasawa puts it, we&rsquo;re in the position of someone trying to bake a cake without any idea of what the ingredients are or what the recipe is.<br /><br />There are more problems. For example, when do micro-consciousnesses come together? Panpsychists claim that the micro-consciousnesses of the particles in living brains combine. But why would they be the only sets of particles that do so? What about those in other bodily organs? Or in computers, trees, rocks or stars? We assume these things don&rsquo;t have complex consciousnesses, but how do we know?<br /><br />If brains aren&rsquo;t special in being the only things that possess consciousness at all, why should they be special in being the only things that possess a complex consciousness? Maybe all physical structures have a complex consciousness formed by the union of the micro-consciousnesses of their particles. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be the most elegant view? We have no way of knowing, of course, since we cannot detect the intrinsic nature of things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>There is a deeper problem, too. If the phenomenal feel of experience is the intrinsic nature of our brain states, then how are we aware of it? To be aware of something, we need a sensory system of some kind that can detect it. The brain probably has self-monitoring systems that can detect the experiences that are occurring within it. Experiences are brain states, and monitoring systems could detect them by sensing their objective physical characteristics, including the effects they have on the rest of the brain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>But by what means could a monitoring system peer into the intrinsic nature of these states &ndash; what they are like subjectively, on the inside? How could one part of the brain see into the intrinsic nature of another part? We are faced with the bizarre possibility that we don&rsquo;t know what our own experiences are like. My visual cortex may know what it&rsquo;s like to see red, but I don&rsquo;t! The absurdity of this conclusion suggests that something has gone seriously wrong somewhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Of course, panpsychists will reply that we don&rsquo;t need self-monitoring systems to be aware of the phenomenal feel of our brain states. The feel, they will say, is what the brain states are like in themselves, and we are aware of it simply by being in those states. However, it is hard to make sense of this suggestion. It&rsquo;s one thing to be in a certain state and another to know that you are in it, and panpsychists offer no explanation of how we get from one to the other.</p> <h2 class="p4">The real lesson of the panpsychist renaissance</h2> <p class="p5">You have probably guessed by now that I&rsquo;m not convinced by panpsychism. In fact, I think the real lesson of the panpsychist renaissance is a negative one. If the search for a theory of phenomenal consciousness leads us to panpsychism, then we should question whether phenomenal consciousness really exists. Maybe functionalism doesn&rsquo;t leave out anything after all.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s true, of course, that the functionalist picture <span class="s1">seems </span>to leave out something, but maybe that&rsquo;s a sort of illusion, due to the fact that we are not aware of the complexity of the processes involved in conscious experience. Perhaps, when we talk about what an experience feels like, we are referring, in an indistinct way, to the complex pattern of psychological effects it produces in us &ndash; effects which, unlike phenomenal feels, can be detected by other brain systems. And as neuroscience tells us more about these effects and the mechanisms that make us sensitive to them, perhaps we shall lose the sense that there is anything more to consciousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Rather than heralding a new science of consciousness, panpsychism may be the last gasp of a prescientific view of what consciousness is.</p> <p class="p5"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p class="lead">I just ran across this jaw-dropping thread on Reddit, where <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1sdmu3/medical_personnel_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/">medical personnel talk about the most uneducated thing they&#8217;d heard from patients</a>. The whole thread is horrifying, but one story struck me as particularly relevant to modern politics. It&#8217;s about <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1sdmu3/medical_personnel_of_reddit_what_was_the_most/cdwklm5/">teaching children what to call their genitals</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I used to teach genito-urinary exams.</p>
<p>Med student asks this hillbilly guy to lift his penis out of the way so she can examine his testes.</p>
<p>&#8220;My what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your genitalia,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Your penis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My what?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point I intervene. I point to his crotch. &#8220;What do you call that thing there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, get Thomas outta the way, would ya?&#8221;</p>
<p>EDIT: Since people are asking.</p>
<ol>
<li>To do a testicular exam right really does take two hands. Also, we ask the patient to lift it out of the way himself because it gives him a sense of control over what can be a very embarrassing procedure. There&#8217;s a lot of the steps in GU and DR (digito-rectal) exams that are mostly just there to establish patient comfort, not to give meaningful information.</li>
<li>This is not the only time I&#8217;ve asked someone what they called their genitals because they did not recognize the proper names. Most people are only taught euphemisms for their genitals growing up. Once upon a time, it was not discussed in school for reasons of propriety. It remains an anatomical grey zone for a lot of people &#8211; they know their thumb is their thumb because their momma called it a thumb, but their momma never told em what to call the thing between their legs.</li>
<li>Which, BTW, time for a PSA: <strong>teach your children the proper names for their genitals early on and make sure they are comfortable discussing their genitals frankly.</strong> Which sounds weird. But when their crotch stays a gray zone, associated with embarrassment, then they are (1) less likely to examine it for irregularities, (2) less likely to tell someone in a timely manner if they find irregularities, (3) less able to communicate exactly what&#8217;s wrong, and (4) less likely/able to communicate it if an adult touches them inappropriately.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>You know what a Republican would call that? Grooming.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another response.</p>
<blockquote><p>ref: #3. This. Source: I am a detective in Crimes Against Children. When a child is interviewed and they use the non proper name for their penis or vagina it means the interviewer then has to spend time clarifying this with this children and making the child more uncomfortable having to discuss it. Also, if children understand that these are normal body parts they will be more willing to learn about body safety and won&#8217;t view it as simply a &#8220;bad part&#8221;. This makes your child safer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Groomer!</p>
<blockquote><p>Preschool Teacher here: If you tell your kids it&#8217;s a bad spot, they&#8217;ll think they&#8217;re bad if something happens, and think they&#8217;ll be the ones in trouble. Seriously, don&#8217;t fuck your kids up because you&#8217;re too embarrassed to say penis and vagina, you dips.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my god, a <em>pre-school teacher</em> talking to students about their genitals? <em>GROOOOOMER!</em>.</p>
<p>Jesus, I hate this timeline.</p>

<p class="lead">Also to Jerry Coyne. Now there&#8217;s a fantasy trio that ought to send shivers of revulsion down your spine! Anyway, I was once again featured on Hovind&#8217;s &#8220;Whack-An-Atheist&#8221; series, and he once again avoided my challenge.</p>
<p>Way back in January, after repeated demands that I debate him, I offered a different alternative: that <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/01/04/the-kent-hovind-challenge/">Kent Hovind should read a book</a>. I even suggested one, Jerry Coyne&#8217;s <a href="https://amzn.to/3vs4nbK"><i>Why Evolution Is True</i></a>, because it&#8217;s a good general overview of the evidence for evolution, and would give him something actually said by an evolutionary biologist to sink his teeth into.</p>
<p>He responded by…<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/01/09/kent-hovind-wacked-me-again/">not reading a book</a>, but just regurgitating the same tired, false points he&#8217;s been making for decades. Come on, Kent, at the very least I expected this would compel him to get some new material! But nope, it was same ol&#8217; same ol&#8217;.</p>
<p>Then he did it again yesterday. Still not reading a book, but instead digging up a YouTube video of Coyne presenting a summary of some of the concepts in the book, and whining about that with the very same slides he&#8217;s been using for years.</p>
<p>My god, but Kent Hovind is the <em>laziest</em> creationist on the circuits. It&#8217;s not a thick book, it&#8217;s written for a popular audience, it&#8217;s a relatively easy read. Reading it might have spared him from making a few ludicrous errors.</p>
<p>What Hovind did was focus on a tiny part of the story, which is generally a good idea, but he clearly picked the part where he thought he had a good gotcha. He drilled down into Haeckel. Coyne talked about how some embryonic features reveal their evolutionary history, like the presence of hind limb buds in dolphin embryos &#8212; retention of conserved features in development <em>is</em> evidence of evolution. Hovind, though, went on a familiar tirade about Ernst Haeckel, and his discredited theory of evolutionary recapitulation from the 19th century.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s totally irrelevant. That a scientist advanced a <em>wrong</em> theory about evolution 150 years ago does not change the fact that embryonic similarities are observed, that they make no sense in terms of modern function, but do make sense in the light of evolution as relics of their ancestry. It would be a bit like me attacking Hovind&#8217;s interpretation of the Bible by citing the Book of Mormon at him; I don&#8217;t think Hovind considers Joseph Smith to be a significant contributor to his ideas. Going on and on about the invalid Biogenetic Law to refute Coyne&#8217;s discussion of embryonic atavisms is basically the Wookie Defense.</p>
<p>Now if he&#8217;d actually <em>read</em> Coyne&#8217;s book, he&#8217;d have known that trying to attack him via Haeckel was inappropriate. Coyne also rejects the Biogenetic Law, as he explains in chapter 3:</p>
<blockquote><p>This &#8220;adding new stuff onto old&#8221; principle also explains why the sequence of developmental change mirrors the evolutionay sequence of organisms. As one group evolves from another, it often adds its developmental program on top of the old one.<br />
Noting this principle, Ernst Haeckel, a German evolutionist and Darwin&#8217;s contemporary, formulated a &#8220;biogenetic law&#8221; in 1866, famously summarized as &#8220;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.&#8221; This means that the development of an organism simply replays its evolutionary history. But this notion is true in only a limited sense. Embryonic stages don&#8217;t look like the adult forms of their ancestors, as Haeckel claimed, but like the <em>embryonic</em> forms of ancestors. Human fetuses, for example, never resemble adult fish or reptiles, but in certain ways they do resemble embryonic fish and reptiles. Also, the recapitulation is neither strict nor inevitable: not every feature of ancestor&#8217;s embryo appears in its descendant, nor do all stages of development unfold in a strict evolutionary order. Further, some species, like plants, have dispensed nearly all traces of their ancestry during development. <strong>Haeckel&#8217;s law has fallen into disrepute</strong> not only because it wasn&#8217;t strictly true, but also because Haeckel was accused, largely unjustly, of fudging some drawings of early embryos to make them look more similar that they really are. Yet we shouldn&#8217;t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Embryos still show a form of recapitulation: features that arose earlier in evolution often appear earlier in development. And this makes sense only if species have an evolutionary history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, <strong>fallen into disrepute</strong>. So why try to play gotcha with Coyne on that point? Coyne is actually presenting a von Baerian perspective here: von Baer, who did not accept evolutionary theory, had observed how similar early vertebrate embryos were to one another. That fact is not in dispute. I can go into my lab right now and pull up slides of sectioned and stained chick, mouse, and frog embryos that all show these shared developmental features. Pharyngeal pouches are a real thing! You can&#8217;t make them disappear by citing someone&#8217;s flawed pet theory for them.</p>
<p>Bonus! There&#8217;s a footnote in the passage above, and here it is.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Creationists often cite Haeckel&#8217;s &#8220;fudged&#8221; drawings as a tool for attacking evolution in general</strong>: evolutionists, they claim, will distort the facts to support a misguided Darwinism. But the Haeckel story is not so simple. Haeckel may not have been guilty of malfeasance, but only of sloppiness: his &#8220;fraud&#8221; consisted solely of illustrating three different embryos using the same woodcut. When called to account, he admitted the error and corrected it. There&#8217;s simply no evidence that he consciously distorted the appearance of the embryos to make them look more similar than they were. R.J. Richards (2008, chapter 8) tells the full story.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coyne is a little too generous here. I think Haeckel demonstrated an over-zealous commitment to his theory, and while it may not have been conscious, he did bias his examples to favor an incorrect idea. He is correct, though, that it is really common for creationists to dig up the dead corpse of poor old Ernst Haeckel and wallop on it for a bit while telling everyone they&#8217;re defeating Darwinism. They aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>By the way, the bit in the <i>Origin</i> where he discusses &#8220;the strongest single class of facts in favor of change of forms&#8221;, consists of Darwin discussing, among other things, von Baer&#8217;s observations of embryos, not Haeckel&#8217;s. Hovind misses the mark again, but I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s read the <i>Origin</i>, either.</p>

<p class="lead">I have never watched this show, <i>The Masked Singer</i>, in which celebrities are dressed up in silly costumes to sing songs, and then celebrity judges try to guess their identities. It sounds insipid. From the few short clips I have now suffered through, it <em>is</em> deeply, painfully, agonizingly stupid. Do they pay the audience to put on over-the-top expressions and squeal excitedly over banalities, or is it just that the kind of people who get tickets to see the show are selected for idiocy?</p>
<p>Anyway, they <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/rudy-giuliani-the-masked-singer-1235234356/">unmasked one &#8220;singer&#8221; in the most recent show. It was Rudy Giuliani</a>.</p>
<p>Is this the new path for rehabilitating the reputations of deplorables, letting them caper and dance like court jesters for the mob?</p>
<p>Fuck that evil clown. Fuck that show.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-07-at-12.10.17.jpg" height="669" alt="Accidental Gods" width="842" /></p> <p class="p1">On the sweltering street corners of Kingston, Jamaica in the years before the Second World War, it would have been easy to find people ecstatically preaching while brandishing the June 1931 issue of <span class="s1">National Geographic</span> as if it was the Bible. In it were several reports of the coronation of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia. Still labouring under the British yoke, and with the stains of slavery still fresh, here was something remarkable: a Black man being crowned as a king, with the white lords and diplomats and emissaries of the world kneeling before him &ndash; a complete inversion of the natural order. For some, this was so remarkable that it could only imply one thing: Haile Selassie must be a god, and he would redeem them. They prayed for the god-king to part the seas, that they could be borne from Jamaica to Abyssinia as compensation for the dreadful journeys made in the other direction only a few decades before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Selassie&rsquo;s original name was Ras Tafari Makonnen. In him lies the origin of Rastafarianism. To deride this story of a religion born in the 20th century would be to miss what has been so eloquently portrayed by Anna Della Subin in her debut book, <em><span class="s1">Accidental Gods</span></em>: an excavation of the deep history of men (and it is almost always men) transformed into deities and demigods. Unearthing these tales is not, she writes, &ldquo;an arcane theological puzzle&rdquo; but an essential chart to the construction of &ldquo;civilisation&rdquo;. &ldquo;To speak of men unwittingly turned divine,&rdquo; she tells us, &ldquo;is to sing a history of how the modern world came to be.&rdquo;<br /><br />With her sense of the uncanny, the ironic, the profane and the weird, Subin is a charming guide. Here we find the cases of Prince Philip enshrined as an idol by a tiny community in Vanuatu, sacrifices to a red-headed East India Company officer in Peshawar, and &ndash; perhaps a record in the field &ndash; the hysterically manly visage of General Douglas MacArthur worshipped in four different places at different times. Subin&rsquo;s unfurling narrative is best exemplified by the grandly deranged and hilarious tale of the Theosophist movement. The story begins in the village of Sibsey, Lincolnshire and traverses two high-profile court cases, the National Secular Society, P. G. Wodehouse&rsquo;s brother, a pioneer of Hitler-worshipping fascist Hinduism, a paedophile ex-Anglican priest, and Russian seances, all culminating in the Indian independence movement and, of course, Mohandas Gandhi, who had to keep insisting all his life: &ldquo;I am not a God.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p1">As with the Rastafarians, what binds these eccentric desiderata together is empire. Throughout the period of colonial expansion, conquerors from Cort&eacute;s to Columbus to Drake would find themselves hailed by Indigenous peoples as gods upon first arrival, and would take this holy praise as the celestial license to overpower and control. Through the need to count and codify subject populations the study of the &ldquo;science of religion&rdquo; evolved as a crucial imperial apparatus, exemplified here by Max M&uuml;ller &ndash; foremost expert on the languages and faiths of India, despite never having been there. With this knowledge in hand, rulers could claim that because these foreign practices never aligned fully with the correct Christian traditions, those people were still too backward to be granted independence.</p> <p class="p2">Of course, the supposedly supreme Christian definitions of &ldquo;god&rdquo; or &ldquo;belief&rdquo; did not hold true everywhere. A deity need not conform to the Biblical model of an omnipotent ruler in an eternal heaven somewhere &ldquo;up there&rdquo;, but could be a crucial part of the functioning of everyday life. Those who &ldquo;worshipped&rdquo; that red-headed East India Company officer were not venerating him at all: they were making offerings to placate a creature that more closely resembled a marauding devil. In other words, what Subin helps us to see is that at the very core of modernity lies the white god, sweating in his pith helmet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition.</em> <em><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></span></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Syrian refugees in London after they arrived from Calais via the &ldquo;Safe Passage&rdquo; legal route (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-2022-03-03-at-16.13.31.jpg" height="856" alt="asylum seekers" width="1330" /></p> <p class="p1">On a warm afternoon last July, Ahmed went back in time. He and I exited the train at Hoylake, a middle-class seaside town near Liverpool, and walked past a Holiday Inn. The hotel had been his makeshift home for several weeks during the pandemic. With its smooth white walls, the building looked so generic it was hard to believe it contained such strong memories for the 26-year-old. But we weren&rsquo;t stopping there, and instead continued on to a small red-brick church: the one place he&rsquo;d felt truly accepted since leaving Sudan.<br /><br />Ahmed was wearing a denim jacket and a beaming smile as he entered the church courtyard to greet his fellow asylum seekers &ndash; former residents of the hotel &ndash; and the volunteers who had helped them. &ldquo;Beautiful boy! How are you?&rdquo; one of the volunteers asked him as we arrived at the reunion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well, everything is good, it&rsquo;s good to see you after a long time!&rdquo; he replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>A total of 110 asylum seekers lived in Hoylake Holiday Inn between May 2020 and February 2021. There were trained doctors desperate to work during the pandemic, teachers unable to teach, teenagers hoping for a better start, civil servants, police officers, farmers, journalists, accountants, architects, artists &ndash; even a beekeeper.<br /><br />Demand for hotels had dropped hugely during the pandemic, just as the asylum application system ground to a halt, meaning more accommodation was needed. Converting them into temporary housing for asylum seekers took advantage of this. There was also a public health rationale. The strategy was put in place to create &ldquo;a safe environment to greatly reduce the spread of Covid-19,&rdquo; in the words of Mears, a company who received a lucrative 10-year contract to run asylum accommodation in 2019.<br /><br />By the summer of 2020, empty corridors and cobwebbed lobbies, abandoned by hotel guests, were once again full of people. Asylum seekers housed in hotel rooms climbed from 1,200 in March 2020 to 9,500 in October 2020, despite overall numbers of asylum applications to the UK falling significantly during the pandemic.<br /><br />Kathy Vesey remembers the day they came to town. In May 2020, around two months after Covid-19 hit Britain, she saw a coach hulking through the locked-down streets of Hoylake. Vesey, who runs the charity A Heart 4 Refugees, discovered soon after that 46 asylum seekers had been placed in the Holiday Inn, directed by the private company Serco. There was no notice. The town had never hosted refugees before.<br /><br />Vesey visited straightaway. She discovered they were all single men, many of them clearly suffering from PTSD. Several came straight from the Channel crossing, their T-shirts torn and dirty. Within 24 hours Vesey was soliciting clothing donations. And the food was dreadful. Muslims were served ham and pineapple pizza. &ldquo;It was an own goal, really,&rdquo; Jonny Brennan, a local pastor, told me. At lightning speed Vesey and a team of volunteers, including Brennan, organised a daily drop-in centre at Hoylake&rsquo;s little red-brick church. They helped organise English lessons, signposted legal advice, and provided company and listening ears.<br /><br />But despite some activities, and relationships forged between the walls of the hotel and the church, days at the Holiday Inn seemed to slow down time. Most asylum seekers are not allowed to work while their applications are being processed. The pandemic worsened this situation, with lockdown bringing about hotel curfews across the UK. People requesting asylum sat in their rooms, churning memories of harrowing experiences. &ldquo;It exacerbates their poor mental health,&rdquo; Vesey said.<br /><br />At the reunion, Ahmed and others ate food, drank coffee and laughed about the hotel&rsquo;s dire cooking. Everybody there had since moved on from &ldquo;contingency&rdquo; accommodation, like hotels, to &ldquo;dispersed&rdquo; housing scattered across the UK. Asylum seekers are given no choice over where they go and single people are often placed in flats with strangers. Even so, this feels to many like a step towards a more permanent home of their own.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>But when it comes to gaining refugee status and the right to remain, progress seems to stall. The majority of former residents at the Hoylake Holiday Inn are yet to have their asylum assessment, Vesey said, even though many arrived in the country over a year ago. In February, there were 67,547 people in the queue for assessment in the UK and over 125,000 waiting for a decision or to be deported. Waiting can feel like its own kind of punishment.</p> <h2 class="p4">Hotels became "detention-like facilities" for asylum seekers</h2> <p class="p5">Asylum seekers had been housed in hotels as early as September 2019, albeit in small numbers. The Home Office had awarded Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contracts (AASC) to three providers: Mears, Clearsprings and Serco. But the strategy only hit the news when the seriousness of the Covid-19 virus caused it to be rapidly scaled up. It quickly began attracting headlines for the wrong reasons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>In September, a study by Edinburgh Napier University found that thousands of asylum seekers had been housed in hotels that were often &ldquo;detention-like facilities&rdquo;. Far from the safe environment that was promised, the investigation found that hotels were hotbeds for the virus, which often circulated during crowded mealtimes. This was just one of a litany of woes experienced by people requesting asylum: haphazard safety protocols, crumbling buildings, miscommunication with staff and sometimes just 15 minutes&rsquo; notice when moving facilities for good. One woman was threatened with deportation, the study found, for refusing to throw her belongings away ahead of a transfer.<br /><br />The key criticism was a detention-style lack of freedom &ndash; doors locked shut at 8pm, allowance abolished. The Home Office previously provided asylum seekers with a &pound;39.63-a-week allowance, but for those moved into hotels, this was scrapped, the reasoning being that hotel inhabitants already had their meals provided. Frustration bubbled over. The glare of the media spotlight followed gruesome events, like a suicide and a stabbing in Glasgow in 2020, and then faded away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Then came the far right. A video of a Britain First agitator outside Hoylake&rsquo;s Holiday Inn circulated on right-wing Telegram chats. &ldquo;Are you waiting for a house?&rdquo; a man demands through a window. Only two days before, the same group had stormed Daresbury Park Hotel in Cheshire, livestreaming themselves banging on bedroom doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something which captures the imagination of the far right &ndash; boats crossing the Channel, the White Cliffs of Dover &ndash; and taps into all these notions of historical invasion,&rdquo; Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at anti-fascist organisation Hope Not Hate, told me. The most dangerous part for Mulhall, though, is not the small-scale digital far right, but high-profile politicians who plaster hatred on YouTube or TV.<br /><br />Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Hoylake in August 2020 as part of his &ldquo;Farage Investigates&rdquo; series, a so-called &ldquo;exposing&rdquo; of the hotel accommodation system that was viewed by millions. Before long the issue appeared on the BBC and Sky. &ldquo;Nigel Farage is the key figure here,&rdquo; Mulhall added. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always been a useful bridge&rdquo; between the niche far right and the centre right.<br /><br />Many of the hotel&rsquo;s residents were terrified. Khalid, a kind and optimistic 33-year-old from Sudan who was trafficked across Libya during the war in 2014, was one of them. &ldquo;We felt unsafe,&rdquo; he said. He had hoped the feeling of insecurity wouldn&rsquo;t follow him to the UK.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Hoylake&rsquo;s locals, meanwhile, appear to have been largely empathetic. A September 2020 protest by another far-right group, For Britain, drew only a meagre crowd, with Vesey saying most of them were out-of-towners. A patient and conciliatory mediator, she offered to speak to anyone in town who thought the asylum seekers shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p> <h2 class="p4">Treacherous crossings and the Nationality and Borders Bill</h2> <p class="p5">But despite its many problems, for asylum seekers like Ahmed, Hoylake proved a sanctuary. Compared to the grime, fear and hunger that characterised his three months in the Calais &ldquo;Jungle&rdquo;, and his torturous life in Libya beforehand, he told me that having a bed, toilet, new clothes and supportive volunteers meant that &ldquo;suddenly, your dreams changed within a few minutes&rdquo;.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Ahmed had worked as a barber. He recovered from polio as a child and walks with a permanent limp. Arriving in Calais, a people-smuggler offered him a deal: cut my hair for three months, and you&rsquo;ll cross at a discount. &ldquo;I thought this guy was playing a game with me,&rdquo; Ahmed said. Nevertheless, he started to cut the man&rsquo;s hair. One day, on seeing his bad leg, an Iraqi man took pity on him and gave him 100 euros. The smuggler was satisfied with the fee. He instructed Ahmed to go to the beach at 9pm.<br /><br />One glance at the waves and two of the 12 people who had gathered to cross fled. The remainder inflated the engine-propelled dinghy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid to die in the Channel,&rdquo; Ahmed recalls thinking as they launched into the cold dark water. &ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s better than to live so badly.&rdquo; The Dover Strait is the world&rsquo;s busiest naval highway. Ships plumped up big swells that lapped over the edges of the rubber vessel, causing panic. &ldquo;Some of them start crying, some of us start praying,&rdquo; Ahmed said. The men dug out saltwater shoe by shoe until, just after dawn broke, a British Border Force vessel rescued them and dragged the boat to Dover port.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Ahmed&rsquo;s is a typical journey for asylum seekers in the UK. More than 28,000 people made the treacherous crossing last year, the most ever. &ldquo;The reason why that&rsquo;s happening is because there are no safe and legal routes to enter the UK to claim asylum,&rdquo; Julia Savage, campaigns manager at north-west England charity, Asylum Matters, told me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Vesey and organisations like Amnesty fear new legislation planned by the UK government will make future Channel crossings even more dangerous. The Nationality and Borders Bill has been criticised by charities, who say it will further criminalise refugees. Under the bill, people arriving by &ldquo;irregular means&rdquo; such as small boats will be granted fewer rights and face greater chance of deportation. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said it will &ldquo;break the business model&rdquo; of people-trafficking gangs across the Dover Strait and help clear the long backlog of asylum applications. But the UN said it would &ldquo;penalise most refugees&rdquo; and break international law.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>&ldquo;We consider it an anti-refugee bill,&rdquo; said Savage. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t crack down on the mafia by punishing the extorted.&rdquo; She worries that rather than opening safer routes for asylum, the new legislation will lead to more incidents like the horrific, and preventable, drowning of 27 people in the Channel on 24 November 2021.</p> <h2 class="p4">Operation Oak and "moving on"</h2> <p class="p5">In February last year, as lockdowns eased, Operation Oak kicked up a gear. This was the name given to the Home Office&rsquo;s push to move all asylum seekers out of temporary contingency hotel accommodation and into dispersed accommodation by the end of 2021; here they would await their so-called &ldquo;substantive interview&rdquo;, in which the case for asylum is made &ndash; a process one minister said was designed to take place &ldquo;as quickly as possible&rdquo;.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>But Operation Oak faltered. The number of asylum seekers living in hotels rose to around 25,000 in January, up from 1,200 in March 2020, when the pandemic hit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Hoylake Holiday Inn now operates as a regular business again. Guests would never know their room may once have belonged to a refugee. But a new, more permanent asylum hotel was opened nearby by the Home Office last autumn, so Vesey and her band of 36 volunteers are still kept busy supporting the asylum seekers and pushing for better conditions. The High Court in 2020 ordered the Home Office to review its abolishment of the &pound;39.63 allowance for hotel inhabitants. They are now paid &pound;8 a week, which still doesn&rsquo;t cover their basic daily needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>&ldquo;If someone wants to buy a toothbrush, they can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Taulant Guma, who oversaw Edinburgh Napier&rsquo;s project, told me. If they complain, they&rsquo;re often threatened with deportation. This is how the UK&rsquo;s &ldquo;hostile environment&rsquo;&rdquo; system works, Guma said.<br /><br />Ahmed now lives in a north-western city in England, in a shared house with other asylum seekers. As he&rsquo;s no longer housed in a hotel, he said, his allowance has been raised back up to &pound;39-a-week. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much but it&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; he told me. Yet 19 months after arriving he had still not had his substantive interview. Meanwhile, he misses his family. His younger brothers and sister, small children when he left, still live at home in Sudan. He calls regularly but the signal is bad. &ldquo;Last time I spoke to them their voices were telling me, like&ndash;&rdquo; He paused in sadness. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re growing up.&rdquo;<br /><br />As Ahmed waits, fighting away depression and traumatic memories from Libya and France, he thinks fondly of his time in Hoylake and the help of Vesey and other volunteers. &ldquo;Kathy owns all their hearts,&rdquo; Ahmed said. In this way, Vesey managed to bubble-wrap the corners of the hostile environment. She has weathered her own traumas, as a breast cancer survivor, said Clint Agard of Wirral Change. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t let people go down. That&rsquo;s what drives Kathy, keeping people&rsquo;s spirits up.&rdquo;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>A small number of Hoylake&rsquo;s guests have been luckier than Ahmed. Mohammed, 39, was granted refugee status in January last year. He stayed at the Holiday Inn for almost three months. Now he lives alone in a social housing flat in the north-west, studying English at college and volunteering for a frontline charity.<br /><br />Mohammed left a government job in Algeria and fled to England in 2019, after he was arrested for being gay. When the Home Office granted him refugee status, Mohammed felt a feeling wash over him &ldquo;of freedom and living as me without restrictions or fear of anyone&rdquo;. He dreams of moving to London, to live near friends and the LGBT scene. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy 100 per cent,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">In dispersed housing in London, Khalid keeps himself busy. Days he spends improving his English, evenings he runs or cooks in his temporary flat. An Arsenal fan, on Sundays he guards the defensive line playing football. But trapped in an uncertain, workless limbo familiar to all asylum seekers, most of his hours are spent waiting for his Home Office substantive interview, just as he has been waiting now for well over a year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The last time I spoke to Khalid, he&rsquo;d just dipped into his weekly allowance to buy pasta, bread and beans for a leaving party. Four days before, after an elongated wait, a friend had ripped open a letter from the Home Office telling him he was moving facilities by the weekend. It was time to say goodbye. The feeling in the room, he said, was not quite sadness. In a transient life, farewells are curt. &ldquo;You make a friend somewhere, you spend good time with them, then they change to other friends,&rdquo; Khalid told me. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re used to that.&rdquo; Perhaps there will be a reunion, like Hoylake&rsquo;s, down the line.<br /><br />But by now, Khalid knows the rhythms of asylum liminality. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, but tomorrow I could get transferred to another place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make any plans for tomorrow. You just wait.&rdquo; <br /><br /><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Will-Davies-photo.jpg" height="365" alt="Will Davies" width="442" /></em></p> <p><em>Professor William Davies is a sociologist and political economist at Goldsmiths University in London. He has written widely on neoliberalism, happiness science, environmental politics and anti-expert politics. His latest book, "<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/unprecedented">Unprecedented? How COVID-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy</a>" (Goldsmiths Press), authored by Davies, Sahil Jai Dutta, Nick Taylor and Martina Tazzioli, was published in March.</em></p> <p><strong>The book, which you wrote together with colleagues from the Goldsmiths Political Economy Research Centre, makes clear that Covid has given greater clarity to several striking and uncomfortable truths about the workings of the British state and its economy: the central role played by a &ldquo;shadow state&rdquo; of &ldquo;contract rentiers&rdquo;; the shape and geography of inequality here. You&rsquo;ve studied political economy and statecraft for decades. What, if anything, has struck you as especially remarkable over the past two years?<br /><br /></strong>One thing that&rsquo;s been astonishing is that an economy that had long been organised around housing, as a driver of inequality, a focal point of macroeconomic policy and a cultural obsession, was able to become even more so, to the point where one now has to recognise that houses and households are the pivotal institution of British capitalism.<br /><br />I mean this in a number of ways. Firstly, Covid-19 saw yet more house price inflation internationally, caused by the asset-purchasing programmes of central banks and a stamp duty holiday in the UK. But, by virtue of the injunction to &ldquo;stay home&rdquo; and the rapid expansion of digital platforms over the previous decade, "home" became a place of work, education, consumption, entertainment and retail. It also hugely intensified certain political dynamics of households, in terms of where financial surpluses and deficits occurred, and crucially where surpluses and deficits of time in the household occurred. In financial terms, this is evident in how certain households built up huge savings over the course of lockdowns, seeing as their opportunities to spend suddenly disappeared, whereas others fell more deeply into debt. But the issue of time was also significant: certain people (those furloughed, without children or caring responsibilities) found themselves with unprecedented levels of free time, to bake bread or watch Netflix, whereas others were under intense pressure to juggle responsibilities arising from home-schooling and home-working. Evidence shows graduate mothers were doing more work in the evenings and at night than any other demographic. None of these processes is entirely new, but they have been ramped up even further over the last two years. What we don&rsquo;t know is what the longer-term legacies of (what we term in the book) &ldquo;hyper-domestication&rdquo; will be.<br /><br /><strong>Has the UK &ndash; both the government and the public &ndash; responded as you would have expected?<br /><br /></strong>Nobody knew what a policy response to such an event would look like, though one could have guessed that central bank asset-purchasing would be part of the mix, as so many economies in the Global North were already addicted to these policies. Beyond this, however, the last two years has been an astonishing revelation of what governments are actually capable of. Firstly, there is the use of their own balance sheets to borrow and spend, without raising the cost of borrowing, something that was deemed impossible for the previous decade. This paid for the furlough scheme, something that was also unimaginable only a few weeks before it was unveiled, but could now reshape how we think about welfare. <br /><br />Then there were the various local interventions. The Everyone In scheme, which initially aimed to get 5,000 people off the streets, but had by May 2021 moved 37,500 people into Covid-secure housing. The designation of &lsquo;essential worker&rsquo; status (for instance in terms of whether an employee&rsquo;s child was offered a school-place) demonstrated that it is possible for policy-makers to distinguish social value, something that neoliberal intellectuals have spent a century denying. Even in schools, where things were very tough for teachers, they acquired a level of autonomy and demonstrated a service to local communities that teachers and unions have long argued for, but which have always been dismissed by central government and the press. In all these ways, the unthinkable became thinkable. <em> <br /><br /></em><strong>What was it about the particular nature of the pandemic itself, as opposed to other crises, that lent it what you describe as a &ldquo;photosynthetic&rdquo; function, &ldquo;feeding tendencies that already existed, while also illuminating them&rdquo;?<br /><br /></strong>This is a very interesting issue. We adopted the metaphor of "photosynthesis" because we recognised that the pandemic isn&rsquo;t just an ordinary economic crisis. In many ways, it exacerbates tendencies that were already there (as in the example of the household economy and housing), but by virtue of it affecting everybody, had a powerful political effect in raising consciousness and visibility of these tendencies. Crises aren&rsquo;t always like this. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was the biggest of its kind since the 1930s, and yet if you owned your own home, were retired, or employed in a senior position, it didn&rsquo;t really hit you much. Thanks to policy choices, the costs were pushed towards the young, public sector workers, local government and those dependent on local government. The politics of the pre-Covid decade was shaped by these divergent experiences. <br /><br />With Covid, some got rich out of it, many died, and nobody could entirely ignore it. It had a clarifying and politicising effect, the consequences of which I suspect we&rsquo;ve not yet seen. The type of state, labour market, care infrastructure, society were unavoidable matters of concern, across ages, classes and geography. <br /><br /><strong>One point the book makes early on, when discussing the cronyism in government around the awarding of Covid-related contracts, is that proximity to the British state &ndash; if not the Conservative Party itself &ndash; &ldquo;now represents a business model&rdquo;. Is this a marked change in the nature of government-to-business relations in the UK? <br /><br /></strong>I think there were three things going on here. The first is that the British state has been a source of revenue for a whole industry &ndash; public service outsourcing &ndash; since the late 1980s. This has been well-documented by the likes of CRESC and Brett Christophers, who classifies &ldquo;contract rentiers&rdquo; as one of the major forms of rentiership at the heart of British capitalism. When a Minister has a major policy problem, you can count on two hands the possible consultancy firms and service providers who they will turn to to solve it. <br /><br />Secondly, the post-Brexit Conservative Party and Johnson leadership is evidently far more relaxed about helping its donors and friends, from positions of power. We shouldn&rsquo;t exaggerate the purity of British politics pre-Johnson, but we know that the state operates in a more clientelist way than it did only a few years ago, as is often associated with &lsquo;populist&rsquo; regimes. The third is that the emergency of Spring 2020 and onwards clearly deepened this tendency, as exhibited by the &ldquo;VIP Lane&rdquo; that was discovered through which Covid contracts were awarded without usual procurement procedures. So again, something &ldquo;photo-synthetic&rdquo; occurred, in that features of the British state that had become sedimented over the previous 30 years &ndash; and others that were features of the past five years &ndash; were suddenly thrown into the limelight, and amplified.<br /><br /><strong>You also make the point that one of the great tragedies of the pandemic is the priority accorded to the nation and to national policy-making. Why is this to be lamented? <br /><br /></strong>Because the pandemic is a singularly global event. It&rsquo;s hard to conceive of anything that could have brought so many people, across so many national and cultural boundaries, into such simultaneity like this. That is a consequence of jet travel, and it is the first airborne pandemic since jet-based business travel and tourism engulfed the entire globe. That it has also occurred in the context of the internet and social media adds to the intensely global sensibility that it has generated, much as Benedict Anderson wrote of how &ldquo;print capitalism&rdquo; enabled the rise of nations in the 18th century, by bringing members of large territories into a single chronology of experience. <br /><br />Responses would ideally be global as well, in terms of vaccination and protection of the vulnerable. Instead, we saw what Adam Tooze has described as an &ldquo;Olympics of national governance&rdquo;, in which each nation pursued its own distinctive path. I guess this had benefits from an experimental point of view, but it also saw drastic escalation of border controls, with dire consequences for refugees, and some frankly racist hierarchies of which nations were perceived to pose greatest risk to others. As Tooze has argued, none of this bodes well for the larger global crisis of climate breakdown. <br /><br /><strong>The book notes the central role played by data and data platforms in critical decision-making processes around the Covid-19 response. How does this transform state power?<br /><br /></strong>Data, in its 21st century digital form, has been crucial to pandemic responses in societies such as the UK. This is true for the somewhat botched track-and-trace system, in which the Covid-19 app, venue check-ins and ubiquitous QR codes became an attempt at rolling out surveillance. This was met with considerable hesitancy, made worse by anxieties surrounding the use of NHS data, meaning that the system never really delivered. In countries that experienced SARS, such as South Korea, such platform-based surveillance was far more advanced, with considerably greater state enforcement. Vaccine roll-out was enabled by data analytics provided by firms such as the controversial Palantir. Then there is the ongoing question about what access data and AI firms might attain as part of their services to the NHS.<br /><br />These public-private partnerships are unlike many outsourcing contracts, as they grant private platforms and data analysts a form of sovereignty over us, not only in terms of surveillance, but in terms of making crucial decisions over our movements and freedoms. The geographer Louise Amoore has identified this in relation to electronic borders, operated by what she terms an &ldquo;consultocracy&rdquo;, that is, power and decisions in the hands of IT service providers. The capacity to sustain certain forms of movement and market, under exceptional conditions, is conditioned by the handing over of powers once unique to the state, into the hands of commercial data analysts. This is why companies like Palantir provoke such unease. <br /><br /><strong>The whole experience has polarised many over the question of public vs. state power. Anti-vaxxers and anti-mask wearers, often but not always rather &ldquo;anti-state&rdquo; in their orientation, are derided as selfish and self-sabotaging; those who comply with the rules are conversely seen as complicit in supporting a widening of state and para-state powers. Was there ever a safe middle line to tread between personal health and personal freedoms?<br /><br /></strong>I think there was, but one shouldn&rsquo;t become too seduced by hindsight. We can all look back on some of the excesses of lockdowns (closed playgrounds, bans on sitting down in parks) and wonder what the hell was anyone thinking. But there was intense fear at the time of something entirely novel. Nobody in a position of expertise was advising in favour of moderation, because the great fear was the situation witnessed in Lombardy, of hospitals completely overwhelmed. I think children&rsquo;s wellbeing, education and longer-term prospects should have received far more attention and priority, but that reflects as much on warped generational priorities as anything else. <br /><br /><strong>As someone who was writing widely, long before the pandemic, on various manifestations of state overreach, how have you, in your own day-to-day life, grappled with this tension between accepting measures that are intended to protect public health &ndash; mask wearing, handing over of high volumes of personal data, tighter border controls &ndash; and relinquishing of personal freedoms? How have you thought this through and reasoned with its outcomes? <br /><br /></strong>It's extremely difficult, because I have sufficient confidence in the scientists advising the government, and even sufficient confidence in many senior figures in the government, to accept that measures were introduced according to the best balance of evidence that they could come up with at the time. We know that measures were introduced too late in Britain in March 2020, and that had they been introduced sooner, then deaths would have been fewer and freedoms restored sooner, but that&rsquo;s a different issue. We were broadly living in a very fallible utilitarian experiment, never conducted before, and I don&rsquo;t believe anyone knew with very much confidence what was the best way to make trade-offs. In that sense of real-time decision-making, with a lot of &ldquo;noise&rdquo;, it did resemble a wartime scenario. Some measures, such as mask-wearing, became overloaded with moral symbolism on both sides.<br /><br />I have tried to remain sceptical, without falling into traps of conspiracy theory. The difference between scepticism and cynicism is not always easy to maintain, but one thing that is always worth doing is identifying and calling out those who are themselves acting cynically and opportunistically, including politicians, businesses and other elites, who have exploited a collective tragedy for their own benefit. The Left was also guilty of this at times, arguing for things that resembled a &ldquo;left-wing&rdquo; agenda in certain respects (such as &ldquo;zero Covid&rdquo;) but which failed to acknowledge the facts of Britain&rsquo;s situation. The claim that because the government is a Tory one, it actively wants to kill people, or that schools should never have opened until Covid had disappeared entirely, is not a useful way of understanding things in my view.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook&#8217;s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Please contact your TA for assistance.</p>
