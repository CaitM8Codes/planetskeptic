            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Hilary-Lawson1.jpg" height="485" alt="Hilary Lawson" width="690" /></strong></p> <p><strong>Where did the idea for HowTheLightGetsIn festival come from? Why did you feel that the UK needed a philosophy and music festival?</strong></p> <p>Well, you know, it wasn't a grand plan. I have had an involvement with philosophy ever since I was an undergraduate. And it seemed to me that philosophy was something of a joke in [British] culture as a whole at the time, more associated with the Monty Python [sketch] the Philosophers&rsquo; Football Match, then with answering any serious questions. And I think many people thought philosophy was just lost in an argument over the meaning of words and indeed was incomprehensible.</p> <p>And that seemed to be a mistake. It seemed to me that philosophy is about the biggest questions in life. It doesn't have to be an arcane, abstruse subject. We're all involved in it whether we like it or not. We're alive, and we have to cope with the strangeness of being alive.</p> <p>So that was really the origin of the idea, I guess. And initially, it was just a few people in a small chapel in Hay-on-Wye. And from the moment that we did that first [event], we got a remarkable response. And so it's just grown in a rather crazy way now. We now have 10 million views online on our site. And I think to some small degree, we have changed the way people think about what philosophy is.</p> <p><strong>Was there anything that surprised you, in terms of what was popular?</strong></p> <p>[Initially] I thought that perhaps the more technical subjects, about the nature of language and truth, or about, you know, subatomic physics or something, would not be our strongest suit. And we would go for topics that were more easily accessible, more <em>Moral Maze </em>as it were, that sort of thing. But in fact, it was the most technical subjects that we got most engagement with. And I think the reason for that is not that we were attracting a particularly &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo; audience (although I'm sure we have some very brilliant people in our audience) but that it wasn't being found anywhere else. Those conversations were not found in culture generally, they were talked about in an ivory tower context.</p> <p>What we found is if we put on these debates about, you know, what is the nature of the world? What is the nature of truth? What is the nature of reality? People loved it, because we were actually talking about the big stuff. And we weren't trying to dumb it down for the audience.</p> <p>In politics, for example, we are happy to listen to, I don't know, <em>Question Time</em>, or <em>Newsnight</em>, about a topic we may know nothing about. But we listen and we quickly get the idea. There are different views, different positions, and we work out what's going on. Well, exactly the same is true for philosophy &hellip; And it&rsquo;s really gripping for people.</p> <p><strong>Philosophical questions should certainly have a universal appeal. But do you also think we're in a historical moment now, when humanity is facing multiple existential crises, where it has a particular role to play?</strong></p> <p>Absolutely. I think that in the west we have had, for at least a few hundred years, the idea that we were gradually progressing towards a better world &hellip; We were morally better than our predecessors, we were developing a fairer, more equitable society and so forth &hellip; And that started to fall apart in the latter part of the 20th century. Partly as a result of postmodernist type moves in thought &ndash; the recognition that there are many different perspectives and we can't rely on our own &ndash; but also because the simplicity of the idea that science was just discovering everything, and coming to a final answer, looked less and less credible.</p> <p>And so, indeed, philosophy has a key role to play, because we are now in a space where those previous modernist certainties have faded. And to a considerable degree, many people are very lost.</p> <p><strong>What would you say to the critics of postmodernism who see the tradition as destructive and chaotic, due to its apparent claim that &ldquo;truth does not exist&rdquo;?</strong></p> <p>So, postmodernism certainly made it look as if there was no particular moral outlook, there was no particular theoretical outlook, that it was all a question of the perspective that you had, and people would have different perspectives. And you were just left in a multitude of alternative diverse perspectives. And of course, that, if left at that level, it's fantastically debilitating. How do you choose between them? You just get conflict between the different outlooks and the situation looks intractable.</p> <p>It's not really possible to go back to those simplicities of objectivity that we once had, say, in the British case, in the high point of the Victorian period. We recognise that it is the case that there <em>are</em> alternative perspectives ... but nevertheless, we have to find a way to move forward.</p> <p>What I would argue is, we have to give up on the idea that our language and our descriptions of the world uncover the truth. That's not, I think, what they're doing. Our descriptions of the world are tools to enable us to intervene in the world. They help us get things done. And of course, we always want a better tool. You know, if you are using a pen, you want to make sure it&rsquo;s a good pen. You might improve the nib, or if it's a ballpoint pen, you want to make it flow a little bit better, whatever it might be. But there's no <em>true</em> pen. There's no ultimate pen. There is just a better way of intervening in the world.</p> <p>And you determine, I think, a better way to intervene in the world by looking to see how it's working at the moment. How is your theory working? How might it change? How might you be able to improve things? So I think you can give up the idea that we are uncovering the truth of the world and [instead] recognise that different people have different frameworks, which enable them to do different things.<strong>:</strong></p> <p><strong>Is that what you meant when you wrote <a href="https://iai.tv/articles/post-realism-auid-1755">in an article for the Institute of Art and Ideas</a> that &ldquo;the abandonment of realism does not entail a chaos of equal alternatives&rdquo;?</strong></p> <p>Yes. You don&rsquo;t just think, &ldquo;well, everything is equal&rdquo;. You're trying to make a framework which works better, which achieves outcomes that are more effective and so forth. I think we need to double down on empiricism, looking to see how our theories work. And at the same time, double down on rationality.</p> <p>Rationality is really out of out of favour at the moment. It&rsquo;s somehow thought that rationality is embedded in a particular outlook: a western enlightenment, male perspective and so forth. It has been <em>associated</em> with that, because that's about the idea that it uncovers a single truth &hellip; But I think that we can recognise that the power of the Enlightenment, the power of liberal democratic views, was not about the uncovering of the truth, but it was about uncovering key strategies of improving the way that we think, through empiricism and rationalism. And that's what we need to focus on.</p> <p><strong>But surely there are some facts that can be proven to be true?</strong></p> <p>No single claim about the world has been identified, which is unchallengeable &ndash; that is, independent of the context in which the claim is made. I've had numerous arguments with realists about this. I have sought to demonstrate that even in claims like &ldquo;London is the capital of France&rdquo;, you can find a context in which that could be held to be true.</p> <p>Just imagine: there&rsquo;s an economist talking to a set of bankers in Paris. And he begins by saying, &ldquo;London is the capital of France&rdquo;. And he goes on to show how he thinks that the power of the financial City of London means that it actually controls the economic framework in which Paris is operating. And that would then mean that his claim that &ldquo;London is the capital of France&rdquo; is true. So context is everything.</p> <p>And I think the mistake that some critics of postmodernism make is to have a theological view about truth. I do think it's theological, really. They see themselves as scientists, they're attached to the idea that they can see how things are. And I am profoundly against that. It's a dangerous view, it makes you arrogant, it makes you think there's only one way of going about things and makes you dismissive of other people.</p> <p>[At the same time,] I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life criticising postmodernism, because in some forms it's completely incoherent. When it's expressed in the form, &ldquo;there is no truth&rdquo; <span class="TextRun SCXW84431935 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW84431935 BCX0">&ndash; </span></span>most of the time, that's incoherent, because that's a claim, which is supposedly a truism, you know: it is true, but there is no truth. Well, you&rsquo;ve got something wrong there, and postmodernism is at risk of those sorts of criticisms. We have to work out how to move forward and create an overall framework that isn't self-contradictory in that way, or results in the chaos that some forms of postmodernism do, without thinking that we can just retreat to a sort of &ldquo;theology of truth&rdquo;.</p> <p><strong>What do you make of political actors like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, who seem to be using a perverted version of postmodernist relativity to further their own agendas?</strong></p> <p>I think lots of different things are going on there. On the one hand, I do think that the intellectual culture of the west <span class="TextRun SCXW84431935 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW84431935 BCX0">&ndash; </span></span>which became more postmodernist, in many fields <span class="TextRun SCXW84431935 BCX0" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW84431935 BCX0">&ndash;</span></span> did mean that thinkers like Trump and Putin were able to echo that idea of alternative ways of putting things, in defence of their views. I mean, that postmodern way of looking at things wasn't <em>responsible</em> for Trump and Putin, and I don&rsquo;t think they both go around studying [deconstructionist philosopher] Derrida, but I think that in an inchoate sort of way it it enabled them to defend their position as an alternative perspective.</p> <p>I'm going to add something much more controversial, though, in response to that, which is that [Trump and Putin] did also identify something &ndash; which was that the main outlook of the liberal media in the west was largely the same. It had a similar framework and understood the world in a similar sort of way. And it assumed that this outlook was the truth, with a capital "T", and that everybody else was somehow lying if they held a different perspective.</p> <p><strong>Can you give us an example?</strong></p> <p>Well, if you look at the recent situation with Putin and Ukraine, you see this in action. So that initially, the response to Putin was &ldquo;Oh, he's obviously deranged&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not helpful to see the world like this: a person is behaving in a way which doesn't fit with how we see it, so he's obviously mad &hellip; Putin&rsquo;s way of seeing the world, as I understand it, is very much in terms of a Russian nationalist perspective, a Russian imperialist perspective to some extent, and he's wishing to extend Russian power. Now, we might think that's quite wrong. Of course, I think it's totally wrong. We should do everything we can to counter it. But it is not helpful to think, &ldquo;Well, we've covered the truth. And he's just mad.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>Do you think it would be helpful for politicians to think more philosophically? To bring us back to the festival, is that something that HowTheLightGetsIn is attempting to do, by including politicians as speakers and guests?</strong></p> <p>We're always trying to do that. We&rsquo;re trying to bring to bear the bigger questions on whatever the topic is. And that might be political. Obviously, at the moment, we're all very focused on [the Ukraine war]. But I think it applies in every area. So with science, we ask questions around, where are our current theories going? Are we achieving what we want to achieve? And that, in a way, is just bringing philosophy into culture.</p> <p><strong>What about encouraging debate between disciplines?</strong></p> <p>The silo discipline of a lot of academic subjects means that these bigger questions tend to get overlooked in some form or another &hellip; And that's why our speakers come, you know, all of these world-leading figures &hellip; it's not a marketing exercise to promote your book. It's about talking about ideas. And all of the people we invite are fascinated by ideas. That's what really motivates them.</p> <p>And we also try and encourage a situation where people do genuinely mix. So for example, with our speakers, we don't have separate VIP areas, we encourage them to go out, you know, join the coffee queue like everyone else. You might be standing next to the world's leading scientist in a particular area, or a major politician. It also means that those people are really engaged. And we involve music and comedy and those sorts of things, because it softens all of that status stuff.</p> <p>I mean, we all have to deal with the fact that, you know, life is a really puzzling thing. We're all going to die sometime. And we don't really understand what the hell's going on &hellip; So [the festival is] providing that space where people can have that conversation &ndash; whether it's on the dance floor, or in a comedy tent, or when they're talking about some technical philosophical point &ndash; they can really engage in the question of what it is to be alive.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>More details on HowTheLightGetsIn, the world's largest philosophy and music festival, can be found<a href="https://howthelightgetsin.org/festivals/hay?utm_source=New+Humanist&amp;utm_medium=HL+Interview&amp;utm_campaign=HTLGIHay2022&amp;utm_id=Partner" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="0"> here</a>. <em>New Humanist </em>magazine is a philosophy partner of the festival, and we hope you can join us on 2-5th June on the River Wye in Hay.

<blockquote class="creationist"><p>A number of AiG’s leadership and board were meeting recently, working through how to deal with struggles relating to “deplatforming,” the “woke” culture, and mapping out a way forward to protect AiG and resolve some problems (we can make some of these battles public once we’ve worked around them). We have staff working hard on all this, which is also a detraction from accomplishing the many daily tasks that need to be done. I said to the group, “It’s like being in a war, and we’re planning where to send the troops, where to place the tanks, and where we need to move around the enemies’ lines.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to know how “deplatforming” and the “woke” culture are affecting AiG. They&#8217;re an isolated, backwards little cult that has built their own enclave in Kentucky; are they having internal battles, or is this just a complaint that everyone else in the world finds them to be stupid? They do list some of their concerns, but none of them seem to have anything to do with &#8220;wokeness&#8221;. The first of their concerns is that no one wants to work for them, and this grand ark park that was touted as an economic boon for the region is finding it difficult to employ people.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>1. Labor shortage. Yes, there is a labor shortage across the nation. Soon we begin what we believe (judging from phone calls, group bookings, etc.) will be a very busy year for our attractions (probably the busiest to date), and we need to employ up to 600 seasonal staff for the spring, summer, and fall months. Usually this includes mostly college and high school students and some retirees and others looking for seasonal work. Last year we were short 300 seasonal staff from what was needed. We had many of our salaried staff from all departments working in culinary, guest services, and other areas to try to deal with this staff shortage. </p></blockquote>
<p>So their work force is mainly low-paid unskilled labor, many of them working as unpaid interns (they don&#8217;t say what percentage of their workers are interns &#8212; that would be something interesting to know), and are disappointed that they can&#8217;t get enough menial labor. Why, they had to ask people who are important and paid a salary to baby-sit the goats in the petting zoo! What a tragedy.</p>
<p>Ken Ham has a solution, though. Turn the place into a work camp and bring in fervent volunteers from all around the country. They&#8217;re going to build dorms.</p>

The first building will house 100 student staff. Now that we have the infrastructure (sewage, water, electric, etc.) in place, it will be less expensive to build the next building to house another 100 staff. One building will be designated for males and one for females (there are only two genders of humans, as we know). We believe housing for 200 student staff will go a long way to solving our labor shortage, but at the same time enable us to provide a Christian facility for these students so we can also help mentor them in the Christian faith. The cost of this additional building to house 100 people is $4.5 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a solution! Bring in a captive workforce! It sounds hellish and cultlike, actually. In order to work there, you have to sign a Statement of Faith, along with other requirements, just to be an <a href="https://www.paycomonline.net/v4/ats/web.php/jobs/ViewJobDetails?job=65521&#038;clientkey=36BAEBCF961EB253FD190A922A7D98D6">unpaid intern</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist">
<ul>
<li>Must agree with and be able to sign our Statement of Faith.</li>
<li>Maintains a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>Regularly attends a local, Bible-believing church.</li>
<li>Must be able to work some evenings and weekends.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes you wonder how they&#8217;re going to enforce all that, once they&#8217;ve got you locked into institutional housing. Kids, this &#8220;job&#8221; isn&#8217;t going to look good on your CV, and it&#8217;s going to be an unpleasant experience. But Ken Ham will benefit from your servitude!</p>
<p>Oh, and Ham has another complaint about the world outside his compound.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>3. “Woke” culture. There’s an increasing anti-Christian environment permeating the culture. Increasingly, we’re finding employers will not employ those who come from conservative institutions that take biblical stands on marriage, abortion, and gender (many employers check social media posts to check out what people believe), and we’ve heard of many people being fired from their jobs because of their public stand on God’s Word as a Christian.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Woke&#8221; is not anti-Christian culture. It only means that you are conscious of oppression. Now I know that awareness is the last thing an oppressive institution like far-right conservative Christianity wants, but there are a great many more liberal perspectives on Christianity that are just as valid. I&#8217;m not sure what &#8220;Biblical stands&#8221; he is talking about, though.</p>
<p>Marriage? Polygamy is OK, and marriage in general is transactional…so you can sell your daughters to a suitor?</p>
<p>Abortion? The Bible doesn&#8217;t say much about abortion.</p>
<p>Gender? Likewise. It takes certain cultural norms for granted, but doesn&#8217;t say anything specific. Oh, except for that verse that says &#8220;Love your neighbor, unless they use a pronoun you dislike.&#8221; (Sorry, I made that up, but evangelical Christianity makes shit up all the time, so it&#8217;s OK.)</p>
<p>Also, I don&#8217;t see how this is a problem for AiG. If there are other employers who fire people for holding batshit ideas about the culture, then AiG is just a delightful little refuge from sanity. So what if a cake decorator gets fired for refusing to sell a cake to a gay couple, they can just come to work for a Christian institution and get paid very little and get housed in a little apartment and…well, probably not much cake decorating going on, but they can baby-sit the goats!</p>
<p>AiG is never going to succumb to this heinous &#8220;woke&#8221; culture, so what do they care?</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/old-books-1237619_1280.jpg" height="854" alt="old books" width="1280" /></p> <p class="p1">The history of the index, Dennis Duncan tells us, should not be of interest to bookish obsessives alone. Rather, it is one dotted with big personalities and scandals, as well as moral panics that hold contemporary relevance. The first indexes were made in the 13th century by the polymath Robert Grosseteste and Cardinal Hugh of Saint-Cher. In its infancy, the form sparked concerns that it might replace the role of books. The idea might sound ludicrous, but similar fears persist today: if people can find information immediately by &ldquo;Googling&rdquo; (Google is an index, as Duncan reminds us), what use have they for the written word?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>We learn that the mere existence of the index relies on a number of features we now take for granted. One is the alphabet; another is the manufacturing of books in codex form, rather than scroll; yet another is page numbers. When Duncan tries to make use of a 14th-century index, he notices that it is basically useless. Why? Because scribes making copies of books back then paid little attention to pagination. This made indexes almost redundant; only the index in the book&rsquo;s original version would be faithful. &ldquo;Though indexes had been around for centuries,&rdquo; says Duncan, &ldquo;the printed page number would turbocharge their pervasiveness.&rdquo;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>A running theme of the book is the overlapping of the spoken and the written word: one formative development for the index in the 12th century was that, for &ldquo;an increasingly rootless, urban population&rdquo;, there came a greater emphasis on preaching to the wider population. New readers needed new and &ldquo;instantaneous&rdquo; ways into the scriptures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Another earlier development was the birth of universities in France and England. As indexes are useful to today&rsquo;s students, so they would come to be useful for the often religious students of almost a millennium ago. &ldquo;Disputation, the citing of authorities, the reading-out of commentaries (a format with a now familiar name: the <span class="s1">lecture</span>): scholastic learning would favour external demonstration over inner revelation, intellectual agility over endless meditation.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">From early indexes to hashtags</span></h2> <p class="p1">By the 18th century the index was, surprisingly, a subject divisive enough to invite disdain and incite literary bickering. Yet Duncan impresses on us the skill and sheer determination required to involve oneself in the world of indexing. Not only was it once painstakingly manual (like all work with books), but it required &ndash; and requires &ndash; the constant making of decisions about how material can be best categorised for the reader. &ldquo;Its commitment is not to the author but to the reader, and to the arbitrary order of the alphabet,&rdquo; Duncan writes of the index. In a modern age that prioritises the ready availability of information, this is particularly true. Since 2007, he notes, the hashtag has became one of many highly effective improvements in the way we arrange information we want immediate access to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Often, Duncan indulges a likeable urge to treat this bookish history rather like a novel with protagonists: &ldquo;What is their motivation?&rdquo; he asks of Grosseteste and Saint-Cher. The book&rsquo;s witty title also deserves special applause: <em><span class="s1">Index, A History</span> <span class="s1">of the</span></em> encapsulates both the subject and tone of Duncan&rsquo;s animated and amusing work. In a similar vein, one interesting avenue the book travels down is the discussion of whether or not fiction too should contain indexes, making reference to John Updike&rsquo;s quip that &ldquo;most biographies are just novels with indexes&rdquo;. Though the reader might dismiss the idea as fanciful, Duncan provides examples of novelists using indexes either sincerely or as a way of subverting the form for laughs. As ever, the book educates and entertains in the same breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>As Duncan seeks to impress on the reader, the testament to the sophistication of the index is that we barely notice it, and instead take it for granted. This book ensures that, for a brief while at least, we do not.</p> <p class="p1"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="(Ollie Hirst)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/olliehirst_new_humanist_feb_cover.jpg" height="587" alt="Metaverse" width="800" /></p> <p class="p1">The metaverse leapt into popular awareness in 2021, in a world all too prepared for virtual sociality thanks to a year and counting of pandemic social distancing and Zoom Christmases. Last April, Epic Games announced $1 billion in investment to build &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; connected social experiences. In June, Facebook announced itself as &ldquo;a metaverse company&rdquo;, with 10,000 employees working on virtual reality products and experiences, and by October, it had rebranded itself as Meta, driving a flurry of commentary as people scrambled to work out what that might actually mean.<br /><br />The word quickly made it into the Oxford English Dictionary, where it&rsquo;s defined as &ldquo;a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users&rdquo;. Venture capitalist Matthew Ball, whose &ldquo;Metaverse Primer&rdquo; essays have done a lot to shape thinking around the concept, wrote of it: &ldquo;You can walk into any experience or activity, and potentially address almost any of your needs, from a single starting point or world that&rsquo;s also populated by everyone else you know.&rdquo;<br /><br />Online video games are probably the easiest way in to imagining the metaverse. They allow for flexibility of interaction (for example, while <em><span class="s1">Fortnite</span></em> began as a shooter game, it now tags itself as the place where you can &ldquo;Watch a concert, build an island or fight&rdquo;) as well as scale (<em><span class="s1">Fortnite</span></em> has over 200 million players). There are also their highly developed internal economies and social organisation &ndash; in <span class="s1">Second Life</span>, for instance, users can build houses and open businesses, which contribute to its $600 million economy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>But the metaverse is potentially more than just a gateway to digital experiences. It crosses over into physical experiences too. Augmented reality, where the so-called IRL (&ldquo;in real life&rdquo;) world is visible alongside digital content, does not require special headsets or fancy glasses. Recall the <em><span class="s1">Pok&eacute;mon GO</span></em> craze of 2016, where collectible monsters manifested on street corners through the window of an ordinary phone screen. Pop star Ariana Grande has already played concerts in <em><span class="s1">Fortnite</span></em>, outfitted in flying, iridescent shards of virtual glass, complete with glowing white eyes. Perhaps next year you&rsquo;ll attend a concert in full VR while your partner watches it via TikTok Live on their Apple glasses. The future is surely hybrid.<br /><br />Who owns this space is yet to be determined. We might hope for a pluriverse of platforms and experiences that we can explore as we desire, walking between worlds while bringing our identities, social relationships and digital possessions with us. Tech companies, however, seek monopolies. Interoperability will be challenging, requiring more cooperation than the Web 2.0 era of social media ever achieved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Still, the metaverse does not have to be owned by a single company, whether Zuckerberg&rsquo;s Meta or any other. In October 2021, San Francisco tech opinionator Shaan Puri offered a broader and more persuasive definition: &ldquo;The metaverse is the moment in time where our digital life is worth more to us than our physical life.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not new, he says, but rather &ldquo;a gradual change that&rsquo;s been happening for 20 years&rdquo;.</p> <h2 class="p4">The cyberpunk origins of the metaverse</h2> <p class="p5">Gradual then became sudden. The Covid-19 pandemic ruptured social interaction, with the CoMix social contact survey reporting that levels of social interaction plummeted 75 per cent during lockdowns, only recovering to about 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels during the fairly unrestricted summer of 2020. In December 2021, Britons were averaging 2.7 contacts per day, barely higher than the first lockdown. We have seen a profound retreat to the nuclear family: sex outside a cohabiting relationship was literally illegal for several months, and lifestyle media is awash with talk of &ldquo;pruning friendships&rdquo;.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>As metaverse discussions washed backwards and forwards last year &ndash; at a time when I, living alone, went days without face-to-face social interaction &ndash; I started to wonder whether I was not already living in a virtual world. Twitter, with its dramas and &ldquo;main characters&rdquo;, was a conversation I checked in on so many times a day it became a continuous, collective narrative. Discussions with friends (many of them also &ldquo;extremely online&rdquo;, as the phrase goes) would switch seamlessly between digital and offline events. Zoom calls gave me a daily fix of faces. A direct message turned into a date in VR Chat. I have always perceived my online interactions as real and significant, and during lockdown this proved a saving grace: that time may have been tedious, but I never felt disconnected. Virtual social interaction proved surprisingly sustaining. Worlds are ultimately created in the mind&rsquo;s eye, not on a screen or a graphics chip. Language has had that conjuring power since time immemorial.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The metaverse is not in fact a new idea: the term was coined in 1992 by Neal Stephenson in his cyberpunk novel <em><span class="s1">Snow Crash</span></em>. &ldquo;When you live in a shithole,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always the Metaverse.&rdquo; Stephenson famously described a virtual world owned and governed by corporations, mirroring the miseries of an anarcho-capitalist security state outside. It&rsquo;s a 90s concept, then. So what can we learn from thinking about it through the actually existing online worlds of that time?<br /><br />I&rsquo;m thinking of the MUDs and MOOs of the 1980s and 90s: text-based &ldquo;multi-user dungeons&rdquo;. LambdaMOO was the largest and best-known, with around 10,000 users in 1994 and an architecture based on developer Pavel Curtis&rsquo;s own California home. Players would enter through a space called the Coat Closet, which led on to the Living Room, a hangout and place for conversation (complete with a virtual gossiping cockatoo). Keyboard commands let you move &ndash; left, right, up, down &ndash; and upon entering a new room, a description would load on your screen, suggesting various possibilities for action. You could chat with other people in the room in the standard messaging manner.<br /><br /><span class="s2">T</span>wo books provide a vivid record of life in these virtual worlds: <em><span class="s1">My Tiny Life: Crime and Passion in a Virtual World</span></em> by Julian Dibbell in the US, and <em><span class="s1">The Cybergypsies: A True Tale of Lust, War, and Betrayal on the Electronic Frontier</span></em>, by Indra Sinha in the UK &ndash; both published in 1999 but centred on events some years earlier.<br /><br />Sinha was an ad man. Tasked with writing copy to sell modems, he decided the first step had to be getting to know the internet, &ldquo;the oases and caravanserais of cyberspace: this bulletin board, that multi-user game&rdquo;. He quickly became hooked, staying up all night on secretive forums and running up phone bills of &pound;700 a month. His marriage grew strained, but Sinha was intoxicated by the people he met: &ldquo;Jarly the hacker, the lovely and lecherous Calypso, Luna the roleplayer who denied she was human&rdquo;, as well as their stories. &ldquo;What stories! seductions, vampings, fleecings, quarrels in cyberspace that turned into real world bomb threats, a feud that began with an online murder which ended up closing down a whole network,&rdquo; he told the era-defining forum The WELL in 1999.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The book is freighted with insight for the potentials of life in the metaverse. Sinha emphasises how this virtual existence keeps bleeding into real life, and he sought to &ldquo;convey the real experience of what it had been like to live in several worlds simultaneously&rdquo; where &ldquo;it was ALL real to me. All equally real, or equally unreal.&rdquo; People keep crossing over, meeting up at parties and activist campaigns or turning up on each other&rsquo;s doorsteps looking nothing like their characters online. Heightening this, Sinha utilises a flat narrative style in which it&rsquo;s not always apparent where action is taking place. Emotions, especially, bleed over too. &ldquo;The first lesson of cyberspace: that although everything around her, including herself, is fantasy, the terror is real.&rdquo; Yet, as one of Sinha&rsquo;s interlocutors tells him, &ldquo;It is always important to draw the distinction between player and character&rdquo;: that is, online life is a performance, and should be read as such.</p> <h2 class="p4">"A subset of the human imagination"</h2> <p class="p5">Meanwhile, Sinha describes his behaviour &ndash; and that of his fellow travellers &ndash; as an addict might: the telephone line to the modem &ldquo;a hollow vein awaiting a needle&rdquo; that might open up &ldquo;a vast and chaotic world of the imagination&rdquo;. The book&rsquo;s marketing pitched it as a sequel to Thomas de Quincey&rsquo;s <em><span class="s1">Confessions of An English Opium Eater</span></em> and it knowingly slips into the same traps: even when trying to convey the darkness of these virtual worlds, the phantasmagoria and the seduction remain compelling. Sinha later said in an interview that, ultimately, &ldquo;cyberspace is nothing more or less than a subset of the human imagination&rdquo;. This, to him, is both its blessing and its curse. The human imagination can chart some Stygian currents, and this is something the metaverse (and its governors) must confront.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Julian Dibbell, a technology journalist, gives us another story from these early virtual worlds, prefiguring what&rsquo;s ahead. It is to my mind one of the canonical stories of online community, ethics, and what exactly it means to &ldquo;be&rdquo; on the internet. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;A Rape In Cyberspace&rdquo;.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s 10pm in LambdaMOO, the text-based California house party. The entire experience is just databases and code, Dibbell reminds us: all of the entities present, &ldquo;rooms, things, characters&rdquo;, are just subprograms that interact &ldquo;according to rules very roughly mimicking the laws of the physical world&rdquo;. That night, a character called Mr Bungle brings a &ldquo;voodoo doll&rdquo; to the party &ndash; a subprogram that attributes actions to other characters that their users did not actually create. They&rsquo;re not entirely &ldquo;kosher&rdquo; in this space, we&rsquo;re told, but they&rsquo;re also often amusing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>&ldquo;He could have sent a command to print the message &lsquo;Mr._Bungle, smiling a saintly smile, floats angelic near the ceiling of the living room, showering joy and candy kisses down upon the heads of all below&rsquo;,&rdquo; Dibbell writes. Instead, Mr Bungle uses the program to simulate the violent rape and assault of a number of characters in the room, before the others present manage to work out how to disable him.<br /><br />What has just happened? A few dozen young people, sitting at computer terminals, have seen a sequence of words appear and scroll down their screens. &ldquo;No bodies touched&rdquo;, Dibbell emphasises. Nobody even saw any graphic images. Yet, as the LambdaMOO community come together in the days after to talk through what has happened and what should be done, one of the women affected finds herself writing with &ldquo;posttraumatic tears . . . streaming down her face&rdquo;, which Dibbell takes as &ldquo;a real-life fact that should suffice to prove that the words&rsquo; emotional content was no mere fiction&rdquo;.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not calling for policies, trials, or better jails,&rdquo; another victim later writes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m calling for. Virtual castration, if I could manage it. Mostly, [this type of thing] doesn&rsquo;t happen here. Mostly, perhaps I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t happen to me. Mostly, I trust people to conduct themselves with some veneer of civility. Mostly, I want his ass.&rdquo; Thirty-odd people hash out all the possibilities. Had it merely been some kind of thought experiment, as Mr Bungle later claimed? Or should he be &ldquo;toaded&rdquo;, that is, killed? Through this deliberation, Dibbell writes, the party-goers &ldquo;become, finally, the community so many of them already believed they were&rdquo;.<br /><br />Viewed 30 years later, this episode may seem curiously utopian. Whatever we might say happened, here is a community taking harassment seriously. Mr Bungle was indeed &ldquo;toaded&rdquo; &ndash; a kind of social death, not just for his avatar but for the man behind it too, expelled from the LambaMOO community. Would gamers do the same today? I&rsquo;m not sure of the answer.<br /><br />Dibbell and Sinha were writing at a time when people were pretty confident that the online world wasn&rsquo;t real. In 1993, the<span class="s1"> <em>New Yorker</em></span> published Peter Steiner&rsquo;s now famous cartoon, where one hound at a computer quips to another, &ldquo;On the internet, nobody knows you&rsquo;re a dog.&rdquo; Back then, the internet was, as Sinha&rsquo;s subtitle puts it, &ldquo;the electronic frontier&rdquo;, open and lawless. It had not yet been captured by business, and was far from its current enclosure by Big Tech.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Since then we have seen several iterations of this &ldquo;reality&rdquo; debate, which, I would argue, is really a discussion about how we should treat each other in the digital world. Do online actions have consequences, or does the fact they&rsquo;re &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; mean they&rsquo;re immaterial? In <em><span class="s1">Alone Together</span></em>, psychologist Sherry Turkle fretted, &ldquo;Does virtual intimacy degrade our experience of the other kind?&rdquo; She argued that interacting with avatars simulating emotion posed a serious threat to our abilities to relate to one another IRL. Other scholars have explored the ways in which online relationships provide support &ndash; for example, how LGBTQ young people used online communities to find solidarity. Online trolls were seen as tricksters until it became evident that they could cause real harm.</p> <h2 class="p4">A decade of digital change at once</h2> <p class="p5">Then the pandemic arrived, and a decade or more of social and digital change happened all at once. Grandma learns how to use an iPad; Zoom&rsquo;s stock price soars; people adjust to working with colleagues they&rsquo;ve never met in the flesh. Finally, the idea of making any kind of neat online/offline, real/unreal distinction is put to bed as the fool&rsquo;s errand it always was.<br /><br />In his new book <em><span class="s1">Reality+</span></em>, released in January, philosopher David J. Chalmers argues that we not only can but increasingly will live a meaningful life in virtual worlds. In an interview with the <em><span class="s1">New York Times</span></em>, he notes that &ldquo;most of these basic kinds of things that matter you ought to be able to get in a virtual world&rdquo;, from social relationships to learning, and setting and achieving goals. Being in a simulated environment does not make these experiences somehow &ldquo;unreal&rdquo; or insignificant, he argues: they may not be wholly the <em><span class="s1">same</span></em> as IRL, while some experiences &ndash; from awe at nature to the joys of embodiment &ndash; are &ldquo;a century&rdquo; away from being replicated, or may never be. But, he told the<span class="s1"> Times</span>, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear to me that virtual worlds have a lot to offer,&rdquo; although &ldquo;this doesn&rsquo;t make them a panacea.&rdquo;<br /><br />The metaverse remains an apparition of speculation and hype, scepticism and hope. Technologically, the space is wide open, and some capabilities will not be fully realised for decades. Yet I wonder whether we&rsquo;re talking about it now not only out of fascination with what&rsquo;s next, but as a means of understanding the present day &ndash; and the fact that the IRL and the virtual have already merged. Public life is profoundly shaped by the online &ndash; politics, for example, is governed by WhatsApp groups and Twitter posting, and MPs use their time in parliament as a chance to create viral video moments. And vice versa: &ldquo;Virtual space has to be understood as an embodied space in which actual-life selves, practices, and norms continue to exist,&rdquo; the philosophers Katleen Gabriels and Marjolein Lanzing argue. This is why the &ldquo;Bungle Affair&rdquo; felt so violent for those involved, even though nothing ever physically happened.<br /><br />Rather than a discrete &ldquo;place&rdquo; that you may enter and exit from, it might be more helpful to imagine the metaverse as a persistent digital layer of reality. And as with the rollout of the internet in the first place, you won&rsquo;t fully recognise what it is, until you realise you&rsquo;re engulfed.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p><em>This article is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Richmond Road in Bradford (Tim Green / Wikimedia Commons)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Welcome_to_Bradford__8027402174_.jpg" height="887" alt="Welcome to Bradford" width="1330" /></p> <p class="p1">"I&rsquo;m 40 and still regarded as a youth.&rdquo; It was the early summer of 1995, and a local community worker of Pakistani-British heritage was showing me around the rough and sloping ground of a local youth cricket club in Bradford, West Yorkshire, run without any support from official sports bodies.<br /><br />I&rsquo;d come up to make a special report for BBC News in the aftermath of the Manningham Riots, a short but intense period of youth rioting provoked by alleged police brutality in Bradford, which hosts the largest population of people of Pakistani heritage of any city in England. I was there to try to understand the roots of the violence, which had taken the nation by surprise. The un-level playing field proved a handy metaphor for how two generations of young British Asians were being failed by both indifference from the civic authorities at large and the conservative social strictures of their own community.<br /><br />Twenty-five years later, after watching 30-year-old Azeem Rafiq testify before a Commons select committee in October 2021 about the spirit-breaking racism he&rsquo;d endured for years, I remembered that encounter. The teen cricket prodigy, who grew up in Barnsley, 30 miles from Bradford, had captained England&rsquo;s under-15s and became Yorkshire&rsquo;s youngest ever captain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Yorkshire County Cricket Club&rsquo;s leadership stayed in denial until sponsors pulled out. Enemies then signed letters slandering Rafiq&rsquo;s character and dredged up years-old tweets of antisemitic comments he had made (for which he showed full contrition and met Jewish organisations to make amends), thereby undermining the veracity of his own trauma. How could so little have changed?<br /><br />Over the years I have come to realise that Bradford and its environs are emblematic of the UK&rsquo;s wider social crises and broken promises. As a journalist from London, my 1995 post-riot visit offered a limited glimpse into how traditional political racial solidarity had been splintered by social and religious division. The book burnings of <em>The Satanic Verses</em> in 1989 had been the first shock. Who were these people burning books for &ldquo;blasphemy&rdquo;? When I went back after the 2001 Bradford riots, this time for Channel 4 News, a white social worker informed me I was being &ldquo;racist&rdquo; for asking about forced marriage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>I met a female social worker who had previously been part of the domestic violence support group Southall Black Sisters and recently moved to the city. She told me she had attended a meeting where self-appointed male community leaders had demanded that all complaints of domestic violence be referred to them to be dealt with. The police would have agreed, she said, if she hadn&rsquo;t been there to object.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Bradford was one of several English towns where in the past decade British Asian sexual grooming gangs have been convicted of abusing teenage girls. My own encounters in the city seemed evidence of a widespread culture of denial and misogyny, within council services and the police as much as in the community: a culture that had allowed abusers to prosper from Rochdale and Rotherham in Yorkshire to Telford and Oxford.</p> <h2 class="p3">***</h2> <p class="p4">There is more, however, to Bradford. As a member of the advisory board for the city&rsquo;s National Science and Media Museum I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with its grand Victorian buildings and the buzz of its brutalist Oastler market, selling food from across the globe. There&rsquo;s a distinctive attitude and pride, while its citizens come up again and again with their own solutions to help tackle poverty and underachievement.<br /><br />I was hopeful when, in 2021, Channel 4 opened a new programming hub in Leeds as part of their commitment to the Leeds/Bradford area. What Bradford &ndash; Britain&rsquo;s ninth largest city &ndash; desperately needed was proper transport infrastructure to make the most of it. But when HS2 was scaled back late last year, these plans were abandoned. Residents will continue to rely on an often-disrupted connection to Leeds, limiting opportunities and job prospects.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Azeem Rafiq should have been in his prime years on the England team.

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="A portrait of Major Mahomed Akbar Khan by Henry Lamb is hung in the Second World War Gallery at IWM London" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/iwm.jpg" height="981" alt="Hanging a portrait of Major Mahomed Akbar Khan at IWM London" width="1531" /></p> <p>An unknown Ethiopian artist&rsquo;s impression of the invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 painted on an antelope&rsquo;s hide, a jigsaw puzzle made of Nazi swastikas, and a flat iron pan from the Partition of India in 1947. It&rsquo;s through objects such as these that the Imperial War Museum in London is hoping to offer visitors a bold global look at the Second World War.<br /><br />In October the museum opened the doors to its new Second World War and Holocaust galleries after a massive &pound;30.7m reimagining. It&rsquo;s the first major redevelopment of the museum&rsquo;s permanent representation of the Second World War since 1989. A lot has changed. Gone are the hugely popular war &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; of the 1990s, where you could walk through a recreated bombed-out street or trench. Instead, the museum shows the different global environments &ndash; desert, tropics, tundra &ndash; that the war took place in. Experiences of civilians, rather than battles or weaponry, are now front and centre. <br /><br />Links are made between the War Galleries and the new Holocaust Galleries, both through narrative and a shared exhibition space. But it is the rendering of the Second World War that is a significant departure for IWM. Why was it done now? And does it succeed? <br /><br />Every British schoolchild has been taught the stories of Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain. Along with endless repeats of Dad&rsquo;s Army, and the &ldquo;Great Escape&rdquo; sung at football matches, it can seem as if the Second World War is ever-present in British culture. It was weaponised during the 2016 EU referendum by both sides: Nigel Farage invoked the trope of Britain &ldquo;alone&rdquo; fighting the Germans, while the Remain camp argued that the conflict taught us the need for close ties with the continent. At the beginning of the pandemic, then-health minister Matt Hancock went so far as to compare Britain&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic with the national resilience shown during the Blitz.</p> <h2>The vital role of museums</h2> <p>But these takes often have more to do with Britain&rsquo;s culture wars than with historical accuracy. As the last generation that actually survived the war passes away, the role of museums in cutting through the confusion and forging a clearer relationship between the public, the politicians and our national collective memory of the war becomes ever more necessary. <br /><br />We live in an age of emotion, with a need for personal connection. The stories of more than 100 individuals from 30 different countries are told in the new galleries, part of a wider trend in the museum sector called &ldquo;peopling&rdquo;, where personal lives are given space, along with the more abstract narratives of movements and battles. Take Sam Martinez, for instance. Martinez, whose passport is displayed, was an &ldquo;Axeman&rdquo; from British Honduras (now Belize) who rushed to Glasgow to contribute to the war effort. We learn not just of his bravery but of the prejudice he faced: while invited to dances in Scotland, he would also hear local leaders complain about &ldquo;black foresters starting relationships with Scottish women&rdquo;. <br /><br />Discovering his story, we empathise with his courage and determination and acknowledge the acute racial tensions of the era &ndash; although the museum stops short of calling this what we would now recognise it as: racism. Still, it&rsquo;s important to remember that racism itself is an evolving historical concept: the racism experienced today is different to racism as it was experienced during the time of the British Empire. What we do see in these stories is an institution tentatively coming to terms with some of the legacies of Britain&rsquo;s imperial past. The new galleries hope to tell a &ldquo;global story&rdquo;. That includes the former British Empire, but it also extends to the Soviet Union, eastern Europe, North Africa and the Mediterranean. Special attention is given to China, as well as the Japanese and Allied campaign in East Asia and the Pacific. <br /><br />That&rsquo;s not to say it shies away from representations of the war in Britain. However, it does seek to clarify the facts. One way in which the British story of the war has been warped in the popular imagination is the idea of Britain singlehandedly fighting the Nazis, following the fall of France and much of Europe to German occupation. In reality, Britain was very much not &ldquo;alone&rdquo;, relying heavily on its empire for resources, financial support &ndash; and, of course, troops. In exposing its historical inaccuracy, the Imperial War Museum, London shows how this idea erases the contribution and exploitation of millions of individuals across the globe. <br /><br />It is the hope of many historians and museum professionals that realigning the narrative in public spaces like the IWM will exact real political change, encouraging the public to recognise when their politicians, and national press, are touting phony historical equivalencies.<br /><br />The new galleries also want to expand the concept of the Second World War as a &ldquo;Total War&rdquo;, in which the distinction between civilian and combatant is made redundant and entire nations and their populations are mobilised for the war effort. Dr Yasmin Khan, who advised on the new galleries, says: &ldquo;The war touched many parts of the globe far from the usual epicentres or theatres, and impinged on civilian lives in myriad ways: social, economic, political, from food shortages to internment or deforestation. So part of the new approach to the war is to try and understand this total effect, the way that so many aspects of human life were shaped &ndash; often far away from the frontlines, in places we might not immediately associate with the war. This is what I think the new galleries achieve.&rdquo;<br /><br />Indeed, as IWM curator Kate Clements adds, &ldquo;By drawing comparisons between, for example, the experience of civilians being bombed in Britain, Japan, Germany and China, we are able to demonstrate that although the effects of war were felt to different degrees, in different places and at different times, there was a commonality of experience in the war that collectively bound together those millions that lived through it.&rdquo;<br /><br />Hence the museum does not hold back when showing the horrors of war: visitors will learn that in 1941, two million out of the three million Soviet prisoners held by the Germans died within six months, either through starvation or neglect. Similarly, sexual violence &ndash; an often-underexplored aspect of the war &ndash; is shown through the stories of so-called &ldquo;comfort women&rdquo;, those forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army. Starvation and hunger are explored via the controversial starving of roughly 3 million people in British-controlled Bengal.</p> <h2>The "anti-woke" backlash</h2> <p>So, has the IWM succeeded? While generally met with positive reviews, its new galleries have not gone without criticism. A recent review by Peter Hitchens suggested that while impressive, too little was included on how Stalin treated Soviet citizens. Similarly, historian Laurence Rees wrote in the Telegraph: &ldquo;No prominence is given to the horrific crimes Stalin committed during the war against his own people&rdquo;, such as the deportation of entire ethnic groups like the Kalmyks, Crimean Tatars and Chechens.<br /><br />These critics have a point. After all, the Soviet Union did suffer the highest number of wartime casualties and the stories of those abused and murdered by its regime should be fully told. However, we shouldn&rsquo;t ignore the context of these criticisms. After Labour&rsquo;s Jeremy Corbyn years and amid the rising popularity of left-wing politics among young Brits, there is a hint of moral panic around calls to emphasise communist atrocities in culture and academia: a pertinent example of how the war is still being used as a point of reference for contemporary debate.<br /><br />Fears over &ldquo;woke&rdquo; or left-wing education have led to calls for new public spaces which provide a counternarrative. This includes a newly proposed museum to communist atrocities, the board members of which include former Conservative MP Owen Paterson and MEP Daniel Hannan. The would-be director of the museum, James Bartholomew, who is also a former Brexit Party candidate, said last year that teachers &ldquo;who, if not Marxist themselves, are left-wing&rdquo; are to blame for a lack of knowledge about communist atrocities.<br /><br />The same fears over how Britain&rsquo;s past is represented came into play after the National Trust published its report in September 2020 investigating the proven links of some of its properties to the slave trade. The backlash against perceived &ldquo;wokeness&rdquo; led to the foundation of the protest group Restore Trust, which lists amongst its main aims to &ldquo;restore the [National] Trust&rsquo;s original apolitical ethos&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Challenging uncomfortable histories</h2> <p>The government itself is certainly not shy of engaging in these culture wars. Following concerns over the Black Lives Matter movement and the toppling of statues in the US and the UK, then-culture secretary Oliver Dowden sent a letter in September last year to institutions funded by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport implying that their funding could be at risk if they removed controversial statues or objects.<br /><br />Many museums will be watching cautiously. Having lost so much revenue during the pandemic, it would be understandable for some to shy away from taking a bold stance in their representation of the past. <br /><br />Nevertheless, it is more important now than ever that museums continue to question and challenge uncomfortable histories. They would be doing a disservice to the public if their representations of the past were mediocre, or boring, for the sake of avoiding debate and controversy. As the war generation leave us, being able to interact with authentic material culture from the time is even more important for our ability to resist simplistic culture war debates.<br /><br />The new galleries at the IWM are not without fault, and invariably miss out histories that do not fit into either their overarching narrative or exhibition space. But their attempt to offer a more global look at the Second World War is admirable, as is their foregrounding of personal stories, along with the complexities of economic, social and military histories. They offer something that is rarely found on the internet, in political rhetoric or in newspaper columns: the nuanced insights generated by the coupling of historical lives and extraordinary objects.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition.</em> <em><span class="Apple-converted-space"><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</span></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
