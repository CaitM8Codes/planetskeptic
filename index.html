<p class="lead">An interesting local development: we were supposed to have a Division of Science &#038; Math Holiday party back in December, but it got postponed to 13 January because of rising pandemic concerns. I was just notified that it has been outright canceled because those concerns have gotten worse.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t feel like a party anyway, and was planning to not show up.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re a bunch of scientists, you know. It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re Boris Johnson.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">I was pumped to read the <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/12/the-year-in-review-three-major-advances-for-intelligent-design/">Discovery Institute&#8217;s summary of their three greatest achievements in 2021</a>. Finally, the existing paradigm will be smashed! Evolution&#8217;s on the run now, boys! Get ready for the evidence! As the author, Brian Miller, says:</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>The situation resembles a poorly constructed dam holding back water that is continuously rising. Streams of water are breaking through at increasing numbers of locations, and the flow at each location is hastening. The key question is not if, but when the dam will collapse. </p>
<p>Here, I will discuss just three of the highlights from 2021 for the Center for Science &#038; Culture. I will also describe how these successes are hastening the erosion of the materialistic philosophical assumptions hindering scientific progress. And I will assess their implications for the future of the intelligent design movement. </p></blockquote>
<p>All right! I&#8217;ll put on my galoshes and get ready for the challenge of the rising flood…except, sorry, all we get is a fine mist that evaporates as fast as the Discovery Institute squirts it out.</p>
<p>Their first triumph is that Steven Meyer published another book. They all sound the same, and I&#8217;m afraid the only good point of it is that Meyer&#8217;s continuing exercises in masturbation are unlikely to result in incest…although seeing a fellow DI maggot fellating it does come close. Score: 0.</p>
<p>Their second victory is that a couple of DI lackwits published a bad paper on the waiting-time non-problem. It sunk without a trace. You might appreciate this <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/06/ID-and-imaginary-hurdles.html">review of the paper by Mikkel Nif Rasmussen</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s also another example of creationist papers focused on so-called “waiting time problems” with evolution, which are typically based on the entirely imaginary &#8211; and totally dubious premise &#8211; that there are “target sequences” that evolution must find and evolve towards without any input by natural selection, by mutating incrementally from some random ancestral sequence until the correct (or almost correct) “target” sequence is produced by the chance accumulation of mutations.</p>
<p>To nobody’s surprise, the longer the target sequence is, the longer it will take before chance mutations happen to produce it or something very near to it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oops? Is it raining yet? Score: still nada.</p>
<p>Their third devastating discovery is that there was a conference, sponsored by the Discovery Institute, that was attended by Dembski and Behe, that will have <q>ripple effects…for years to come</q>. No, it won&#8217;t, and a gang of creationists pandering to the presuppositions of a few engineers isn&#8217;t going to trouble our well-engineered, strongly-reinforced dam. The DI goes 0 for 3!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m putting away the boots and the caulk gun, and cancelling that bid on a canoe on eBay. Those <q>highlights</q> were…pathetic. I guess the creationists are truly desperate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here in the rational, evidence-based world, PLoS published a roundup of the <a href="https://scicomm.plos.org/2021/12/17/top-7-discoveries-in-human-evolution-2021-edition/">top 7 discoveries in just human evolution</a> (the list would be far too long if they included discoveries in bacteria, or even spiders). These stories include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morphological divergence with <i>Paranthropus robustus</i></li>
<li>Burial practices revealed by a child buried 78,000 years ago</li>
<li>Neandertal genetic contributions to the earliest <i>Homo sapiens</i> in Europe</li>
<li>Ancient art from 45,500 years ago</li>
<li>New hominid species from China, <i>Homo longi</i></li>
<li>New DNA specimens from modern humans, Denisovans, and Neandertals recovered from Denisova Cave</li>
<li>More human fossil footprints discovered</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the gang at the Discovery Institute could have just opened any issue of the journal <i>Evolution</i> and seen far more substance backing up the science of evolution than the feeble gleanings they managed to scrape together for a whole year of creationist apologetics.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Last night, I got this bulk email.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Prof. Asher,</p>
<p>I have just learned that Philosophia about to publish an article by Kevin MacDonald, emeritus professor of sociology at CalState Long Beach, at doi: 10.1007/s11406-021-00439-y</p>
<p>MacDonald has long been outspoken in his conviction that Jews are driven to destroy the cultures of the countries they live in. He is a Holocaust denier. He argues that Jews should be subject to civil disabilities, proscriptions, and special high taxes. He openly supports white nationalist and neo-Nazi organizations.</p>
<p>The paper you are publishing is as full of the falsehoods and bile as is everything else he has written. As part of the endeavor of philosophy and as part of the civilized world you as editor-in-chief ought immediately to retract it.</p>
<p>I have BCC&#8217;ed this email to every philosopher I know, and some other scholars, asking them to join in protesting this publication.</p>
<p>&#8212;Bennett Gilbert</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Bennett Gilbert<br />
Assistant Professor in University Studies, History, and Philosophy<br />
Portland State University</p></blockquote>
<p>How bad could it be, I thought. I don&#8217;t respond to these mass calls for action without checking. So I did. I looked at the article in question.</p>
<p><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/macdonaldpoison-500x511.png" alt="" width="500" height="511" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-65117" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/macdonaldpoison-500x511.png 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/macdonaldpoison-147x150.png 147w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/macdonaldpoison-293x300.png 293w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/01/macdonaldpoison.png 701w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Oh my god. That&#8217;s just the abstract. Every paragraph of the article is essentially, &#8220;The Jews are conspiring to steal our essence&#8221;, and the editors of <i>Philosophia</i> (&#8220;Philosophical Quarterly of Israel&#8221;) didn&#8217;t notice? Have they no reviewers? Do they just have a policy of allowing any old crap they find in their in-box to be published without criticism?</p>
<p>Apparently, Kevin MacDonald squats in his office, simmering in a constant state of hatred of Jews, convinced that they are running a massive conspiracy theory to destroy all non-Jews, and in particular, scrawling out long missives objecting to any criticisms of his past work, all dedicated to proving that The Jews run the world. What a horrible little man, and shame on <i>Philosophia</i> for publishing his bile, and extra shame to CalState Long Beach for allowing him to lie in the name of their university.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here&#8217;s the editor of that journal.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">First, I must remind everyone that billionaire Rupert Murdoch elbowed his way to the front of the queue to get the vaccine as soon as it was announced, and that all those blithering conservative on-air personalities on Fox News are required to be vaccinated, just to put this <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/dishonest-doctors-who-were-fox-news-most-frequent-medical-guests-2021-0">story on Fox News&#8217; promotion of quacks</a> in perspective. It lists ten of the COVID denialist and anti-vax and tepid apologists for inaction who have been featured on the network many hundreds of times. Names you should learn to recognize and scorn: Marc Siegel, Martin Makary, Nicole Saphier, Rand Paul, Brett Giroir, Janette Nesheiwat, Jayanta Bhattacharya, Harvey Risch, Scott Atlas, and Peter McCullough. They all have the title of &#8220;Dr&#8221;, but you should know that the majority of doctors disagree with these scam artists; Fox News has been carefully distilling the population of MDs to purify and isolate the most untrustworthy scum to selectively display on popular programs by even more reprehensible filth like Carlson and Ingraham and Kudlow. You don&#8217;t get a prime time opinion/bloviation slot on Fox if you hold a reasonable view of the science.</p>
<p>Contrast that with this genuinely excellent <a href="https://www.sactownmag.com/uc-davis-microbiome-expert-jonathan-eisen-on-omicron/">interview with Jonathan Eisen</a>, a biologist at UC Davis. Eisen simply and plainly says what every biologist and informed citizen knows about SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Omicron variant is way more infectious [than Delta]. It’s horribly contagious. Even people who are boosted are still getting infected. [The vaccine] does not seem to provide a huge protection against getting infected. I think that’s part of why it’s spreading so fast—people who have been vaccinated and/or boosted have mistakenly thought they were not going to get infected, and so they were going maskless everywhere. But if you have five times as many people infected, that’s going to create havoc, and that’s what is happening in New York and the Northeast, where the hospitals are full. They’re already sending people away who have any other types of emergency or nonemergency health needs. I think we’re in for some tough times; that’s my prediction. </p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly. This is what I&#8217;m expecting, too. It&#8217;s also what everyone who isn&#8217;t brainwashed by Fox News can figure out. So what should we do?</p>
<blockquote><p>All the evidence right now shows that vaccines are incredibly effective in reducing the risk of severe illness and death from Covid. And this is true even for new variants such as Delta and Omicron, even though the vaccines were not specifically designed for them. One can reduce the risk of severe illness even more by getting a booster shot. This reduction in risk is very, very clear from all the data. The one issue with Omicron that is different than with other variants is that just getting the regular vaccine dose (e.g., two Pfizer shots) does not reduce the risk of severe illness as much as it did for other variants. In other words, to reduce the risk of severe illness or death, it seems that a booster is very important here.  </p></blockquote>
<p>This is what infuriates me. Everyone wants the quick fix, the easy treatment, the simplest, most painless way to prevent this disease, and science provides one: the vaccine. Go in to the clinic or pharmacy, poke, you&#8217;re done, death averted. And what happens? People who listen to Fox News whine, &#8220;I want an insta-fix, but not that one.&#8221; They&#8217;d rather dose themselves with hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin or bleach or betadine, treatments that <em>don&#8217;t work</em>, than take the medicine <em>proven to work</em>.</p>
<p>In a world with people who refuse the treatment that works, and other people who <em>can&#8217;t</em>, for other medical reasons, get the vaccine, what can we do to protect ourselves. That&#8217;s also easy. Wear a mask in public.</p>
<blockquote><p>What I’m hoping is that people do a lot of behavioral intervention that can slow down the spread of the Omicron variant. It goes back to the whole “flattening the curve” thing from before, and there are many things we can do. If you’re in crowded indoor spaces, you can avoid doing things where you have to take off your mask—so, no eating. But even with your mask on, not all masks are created equal. There’s new guidance that has come out in the last few days that cloth masks just aren’t going to cut it against Omicron. They just do not, on their own, filter enough particles out to reduce your exposure when airspace is getting filled with virus. What you want is a KN95 or N95 mask.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. Masks aren&#8217;t the imposition the whiny-ass-titty-babies of conservatism pretend they are. When I&#8217;m teaching, I wear them continuously all day long with no difficulty, other than that I&#8217;m generally soft-voiced and muffling me doesn&#8217;t help (I&#8217;m working on it by TALKING LOUDER with my teaching voice). I tried to order some N95 masks in time for spring classes, but right now they&#8217;re backlogged and horribly expensive, so I settled for N94…still expensive with slow delivery &#8212; I think they&#8217;re all coming from South Korea &#8212; but I&#8217;ll double-up with a cloth mask until N95s become more available, I hope. If they do.</p>
<p>Eisen mentions also that he avoids big indoor events, even restaurants, and won&#8217;t fly, although he thinks if everyone on the plane takes reasonable precautions it&#8217;s probably safe. It&#8217;s just that too many people have been infected with the Fox brain-rot. Just glance at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=airplane+fight+erupts+mask">YouTube fights over masks on airplanes</a> &#8212; people are getting into brawls in the aisles because they refuse to wear a mask. It&#8217;s nuts.</p>
<p>I avoid going out because I live in a county where practically <em>no one</em> wears a mask, ever. Even when our governor imposed a mask mandate, briefly, a lot of people ignored it, and our local business wouldn&#8217;t enforce it &#8212; and even then, half the population was incapable of figuring out that the mask covers your mouth <em>and</em> nose. It was good news when my university reluctantly decided to require masks and vaccines for all of our incoming students, but we&#8217;re a tiny island of common sense in an ocean of conservative denialists of basic medical facts.</p>
<p>We also need to worry about the long-term consequences of infection. Idiots like those talking heads on Fox News want to pretend it&#8217;s just a kind of flu, you get over it and carry on, but COVID has complications you ignore at your own peril.</p>
<blockquote><p>That is one of my biggest concerns with this attitude of not worrying about Omicron too much because it might cause less severe symptoms. We know that long Covid is a problem for the other variants. It’s a big problem that is poorly understood medically, but is very clearly a real thing. These are real medical problems that people are having for months to now years after infection. Some people are saying everybody is going to eventually get Omicron, and that’s just the wrong attitude. We can make it so that not everybody gets it, and therefore reduce the risk of long Covid in too many people. We can’t just let it spread to everyone on the globe, because that’s going to be a medical catastrophe. Now is not the time to do nothing and hope for the best.

<p>Eisen&#8217;s is the kind of sensible voice we ought to have been hearing all along in our news media, providing accurate, honest information. I guess Rupert Murdoch knows that that doesn&#8217;t sell, unfortunately. And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re screwed right now.</p>

At its most benign, &ldquo;Thought for the Day&rdquo; has offered comfortable homilies from the likes of Rabbi Lionel Blue, and while dominated by Anglican and Catholic voices, it is inclusive of several major world religions. But it remains closed to humanists. In my two stints working on the <em>Today </em>programme in the early 90s it was clear that whatever the programme&rsquo;s editors thought of TFTD, it could not be touched. <br /><br />The battle to get humanists on the strand has been going on for decades. It has become a symbolic issue, given TFTD&rsquo;s prominent position on the nation&rsquo;s flagship morning news programme. And there is an untold side to this history. While researching the private diaries and letters of the late Christian activist Mary Whitehouse, I uncovered evidence of her efforts and strategic role in allying establishment forces &ndash; including, it seems, the Queen &ndash; in keeping humanists off the strand. In exploring the roots of Whitehouse&rsquo;s hostility to the movement in the 1960s and 70s, there are valuable lessons to be learned for our own culture wars today.<br /><br />It is 20 years since Whitehouse died, at 91 years of age. Often compared to the American conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, she fought many battles over four decades of campaigning for &ldquo;decency&rdquo;. Whitehouse came to prominence in the 1960s as Britain was being transformed through the youth-focused energy of pop music, film and television. Churchgoing was in significant decline and new immigrant communities were widening the range of religious beliefs.<br /><br />One of her earliest campaigns, in 1964, was to &ldquo;clean up TV&rdquo;, with a particular focus on the BBC. In 1965, she founded the grassroots National Viewers&rsquo; and Listeners&rsquo; Association which, even when its membership numbered tens of thousands, was never more than a platform for her personal lobbying power. <br /><br />In her early career, Whitehouse was an evangelical outsider challenging the complacency of the established Churches. By the 1980s she was very well connected with those in power. But to my surprise, it&rsquo;s in 1994, in her final years, that she fought one of her least known, but perhaps most successful, battles: to keep humanists off &ldquo;Thought for the Day&rdquo;.</p> <h2>The decline of Christian identity in Britain</h2> <p>In July 1994 Mary Whitehouse had finally retired from public life, frail and suffering considerable pain from a back injury. The Conservative government was increasingly blighted by &ldquo;sleaze&rdquo; allegations over MPs&rsquo; sexual behaviour and financial wrongdoing. That same month the Sunday Trading Act came into force, allowing shops to open on the Christian Sabbath. <br /><br />It seemed like a watershed moment in the decline of Christian identity in British life. Perhaps it was no coincidence, then, that in December that year Whitehouse spotted a <em>Sunday Times</em> article claiming John Birt, BBC director general since 1992, had approved humanists being included in TFTD from the following year.<br /><br />&ldquo;Apparently the decision will be made in the next week or two!&rdquo; she wrote in her diary on Christmas morning. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve done nothing about it! We fought this battle in the early days of our campaign. And here we are &ndash; back again. Think I should write to the Queen. Dukie [Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC Chairman and by now a personal friend] to the Cardinal and leaders of the free churches.&rdquo;<br /><br />In January 1995 she did just that. The draft of the letter, dated 5 January, begins:<br /><br />&ldquo;Your Majesty,<br /><br />"I write with the greatest respect in the hope that you will feel able to help in a matter which we believe to be of the greatest importance.<br /><br />"We understand that the British Humanist Association, which has long been campaigning for access to Thought For The Day, the highly influential section of the BBC&rsquo;s breakfast broadcasting, may soon be granted such facilities in an imminent re-organisation of religious broadcasting.<br /><br />"It would be wholly inappropriate for me to point out to Your Majesty, of all people, the importance of the Christian faith in our history and culture and what would be lost in the quality of personal and national Iife were it to become merely an alternative to humanism. <br /><br />"If you do see your way clear to taking any initiative in this matter then surely the nation&rsquo;s gratitude would be very great.&rdquo;<br /><br />Whitehouse&rsquo;s diary entry for 14 January suggests good news: &ldquo;Really delighted to have a letter from Buckingham Palace in reply to mine to the Queen about the proposal that the British Humanist Association&rsquo;s (BHA) demand for time on Thought For The Day. Although not &ndash; as we all understand &ndash; written by the Queen herself it was a very reassuring letter. I would be very surprised if doesn&rsquo;t do something.&rdquo; The Bodleian has redacted the palace reply.<br /><br />Just over a week later, Whitehouse wrote identical letters to George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Cardinal Basil Hume, Archbishop of Westminster:<br /><br />&ldquo;I am taking the liberty of writing to ask if you will consider making a public stand against what could be a most disastrous move, not only in terms of the spiritual health of the nation, but also of its social wellbeing.&rdquo; Adding that she had already written to the BBC Chairman, she continues, &ldquo;I trust you will agree that this is a matter of the utmost importance and that you will see your way clear to employing your considerable influence in support of the Christian heritage of the nation.&rdquo;<br /><br />A reply dated 27 January came from Archbishop George Carey at Lambeth Palace:<br /><br />&ldquo;I have certainly made my views clear on this to Ernest Rea [the BBC&rsquo;s head of Religion and Ethics] but I can assure you that I will exert my influence against this proposal.&rdquo; He went on to warn Whitehouse against overreacting to the <em>Sunday Times</em> article, which &ldquo;could bring about the result that neither of us wants!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s signed: &ldquo;Yours ever, George.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Resisting humanism on the BBC</h2> <p>What happened in the intervening months? Mary was out of the loop. But her diary on 14 April records that the wheels she had perhaps set in motion appeared to be nearing their endpoint. <br /><br />&ldquo;Delighted to see in today&rsquo;s <em>Telegraph</em> that the BBC is to keep its TFTD as Christian, resisting the efforts of the humanists to infiltrate and no doubt come to dominate! We made our voice heard about that! Wonder, if not for the first time, if the fact that I have &lsquo;retired&rsquo; and not likely to be associated directly with what happens, makes TV big boys more likely to &lsquo;deal with problems&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br /><br />The remark about &ldquo;TV big boys&rdquo; seems fair, given the way she had been routinely mocked and treated with disdain as a lower-middle-class, provincial older woman. However, Andrew Copson, current chief executive of Humanists UK (formerly the BHA), is less sympathetic:<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really weird that she sees humanists as being like a conspiracy and organising and lobbying,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one doing that, not the BHA in a secret shady cabal. It&rsquo;s her! I don&rsquo;t know how influential Mary Whitehouse was in this battle but I do think that for all her rhetoric about being like a gadfly and a challenger . . . she&rsquo;s the one with the powerful friends.<br /><br />&ldquo;Humanism has in my knowledge got as far as three director generals agreeing with our point . . . that for the dignity of our listeners and for the fairness of our public broadcaster, humanist views should be included. Face-to-face in all three cases. And just a couple of weeks later for the invisible brick wall to appear. So it obviously is a totemic issue.&rdquo;<br /><br />John Birt, now Lord Birt, recalls the power of the religious leaders who sat on the UK broadcasters&rsquo; Central Religious Advisory Committee (CRAC): &ldquo;In very general terms I do remember being sympathetic to allowing humanist voices onto TFTD,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;And again in general terms I was always struck by the power of CRAC, which operated across all of broadcasting, and how fiercely it defended the position of the established religions within broadcasting. And the political reality was that the [BBC] Board of Governors was unlikely to support anything CRAC strongly opposed.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was only in 2009 that CRAC was replaced by a new body, the Standing Conference on Religion and Belief, which does include humanists.</p> <h2>Undermining the west and its Christian stability</h2> <p>As Copson observes: &ldquo;The growing humanism of the British population was everything [Whitehouse] was against . . . because it stood and it stands for freedom of choice, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, equal treatment, no religious privilege.&rdquo;<br /><br />But Whitehouse didn&rsquo;t see humanists like that. To understand her deep loathing of humanism it&rsquo;s essential to appreciate how deeply she linked it with communism, liberalising pornography and lowering the age of sexual consent as weapons to undermine the west and its Christian stability. This perception stemmed back at least to the early 70s, and a bitter culture war in the UK over shifting boundaries on decency, sexual consent and pornography, which was often fought on the airwaves as well as in the national press. Humanists were prominent in leading the national conversation.<br /><br />At the time, humanism was being increasingly normalised in British society. The BHA was lobbying for state school education to reflect the growth in non-religious philosophies and traditions. A number of humanists were making influential, challenging television for the BBC, including the young producer David Kennard, who was the first to bring on atheists to challenge Christian leaders on <em>The Sunday Debate</em>, a high-profile television slot which ran from 1973 to 75. Kennard went on to work on landmarks of cultural broadcasting with two of the late 20th century&rsquo;s best-known humanist thinkers, Professor Jacob Bronowski and Carl Sagan. The former&rsquo;s <em>The Ascent of Man</em> challenged the narrow Judaeo-Christian view of &ldquo;civilisation&rdquo;, while Sagan&rsquo;s astronomy series, <em>Cosmos</em>, placed humans in a beautiful but godless universe. <br /><br />But Whitehouse&rsquo;s moral outrage found particular traction on one controversial issue that the British Humanist Association got engaged with. This was the campaign to lower the age of sexual consent to 14, or even 10. Pushed by the Paedophile Information Exchange, it was backed by the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL &ndash; now Liberty). <br /><br />On 3 June 1976, she published an article in the <em>Times</em> about her opposition to a report that recommended liberalising the teaching of religion and ethics in schools. The article references the campaign to lower the age of sexual consent and links the BHA to the NCCL as part of a permissive cabal:<br /><br />&ldquo;The BHA has little in common with historical humanism, which sought to discover man&rsquo;s role in relation to God. Rather its natural allies are bodies like the National Council for Civil Liberties and indeed, at its annual meeting the association&rsquo;s general secretary, Kenneth Furness, will propose a motion welcoming and supporting the recent NCCL recommendations &lsquo;that the age of consent should be lowered to 14 for both heterosexuals and homosexuals and that incest be made legal&rsquo;. No wonder they feel that young people educated in the Christian faith are likely to present a problem.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was Whitehouse and her supporters whose campaigning exposed how the Paedophile Information Exchange was jumping on the sexual liberation bandwagon, aided by the NCCL. <br /><br />A few days later she wrote in the <em>Guardian</em> about her concerns at comments by the head of the British Board of Film Censors, John Trevelyan, on the impact of liberalising laws around film censorship and pornography:</p> <p>&ldquo;The apparent enthusiasm of the permissible lobby in its advocacy of an end to the age of consent shows a lack of compassion which is truly frightening. There should be no conviction says Trevelyan, &lsquo;if consent can be proved or shown to have been probable&rsquo; &ndash; think what kind of pressure might be exerted here. &lsquo;There can be no standard rate of maturity in young people.&rsquo; Quite so. So who, may I ask, is going to decide a girl&rsquo;s maturity? Are we now to set up, on the National Health, a series of Lolita Clinics which will provide a girl/boy child, after suitable investigation, with a little badge carrying the inscription &lsquo;certified mature &ndash; Try me.&rsquo; Certified insane, if you ask me.&rdquo;<br /><br />Furness himself chose to mock Whitehouse in the <em>Guardian</em> letters page using his BHA title: <br /><br />&ldquo;Mary Whitehouse displays a deep and detailed knowledge of pornographic material of all kinds. Unlike most of us, she is not apparently bored by this material. Is she however corrupted by it? And if not, why not? Yours faithfully Kenneth Furness Gen Sec BHA.&rdquo;</p> <h2>The fight against conservative forces</h2> <p>Reading the sneering way some humanists responded to Whitehouse&rsquo;s concerns about sexual exploitation of women and children made me think of the feminist Andrea Dworkin&rsquo;s astute observation in her 1982 book <em>Right-Wing Women</em>: &ldquo;Right-wing women are sure that the selective blindness of liberals and leftists especially contributes to more violence, more humiliation, more exploitation for women, often in the name of humanism and freedom (which is why both words are dirty words to them).&rdquo; <br /><br />As Copson says: &ldquo;A lot of humanists were involved in some really quite distasteful legal cases. [Barrister and author] John Mortimer was an active humanist and a member of the BHA&rsquo;s advisory council. And he was defending all sorts of distasteful people [pornographers] on freedom of speech grounds.&rdquo;<br /><br />In a witness statement in 2020 to the British government&rsquo;s ongoing independent inquiry into historic child sexual abuse, Liberty&rsquo;s then acting director, Corey Stoughton, reaffirmed the organisation&rsquo;s apologies and regret over its &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; in supporting the Paedophile Information Exchange. He quoted the charity&rsquo;s former director, Shami Chakrabarti, who said in 2014: &ldquo;It is a source of continuing disgust and horror&rdquo; that the NCCL had been infiltrated by paedophiles in the 1970s. Stoughton added that such failures would not and could not be repeated. <br /><br />We can only hope that they won&rsquo;t be. However, the story may still hold valuable lessons for us today. According to Copson, while Whitehouse lost her long-term war, she was successful in the short term in pushing back against the influence of humanism in British society at large for a good decade in the 70s and 80s. She was able to do so by emphasising the controversial issues being championed at the time by a few high-profile figures.<br /><br />As the left today finds itself caught up in bitter culture wars, there is perhaps a warning from Mary Whitehouse&rsquo;s establishment-backed war on humanism: battles must be picked carefully, for fear of losing a decade or more to conservative forces.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/61poUt_IqaL.jpg" height="1287" alt="61poUt_IqaL" width="586" /><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>Variations </strong>(Influx Press) by Juliet Jacques</p> <p>Who gets to speak in a literary text, and who gets to decide who speaks? Some critics may claim that talent is the only determinant of whether a writer makes it onto the published page, although the emerging female and queer voices &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; from previous centuries and published to popular and critical acclaim show this cannot be true.<br /><br />I think we should have that in mind while reading Juliet Jacques, whose voice and experience &ndash; as well as the voices and experiences of the characters in her latest book, <em>Variations</em> &ndash; have been brought into view in part thanks to the profound cultural change happening right now. Jacques&rsquo; idiosyncratic, campy voice, her tendency to draw on seemingly disparate interests in cultures considered both &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; (from avant-garde art to football), combined with her perspective as a trans woman, make for a very rare quality. I have been an avid reader of Jacques for some years, from when she first raised LGBTQ+ issues as a journalist and told her own history of transitioning in the <em>Guardian</em>, to her remarkable <em>Trans: A Memoir</em>. Appearing in 2015, the book displayed her characteristic combination of dry, self-deprecating humour and stunning erudition, but also her surprising tenderness in depicting her family&rsquo;s reactions and her social surroundings.<br /><br /><em>Variations</em> is the most mature and ambitious Jacques work to date. It&rsquo;s conceived as a series of fictionalised stories, each told in a different literary form: a film script, an epistolary novel, a found diary, even a medical report. In each, a fictional character gives voice to a different side of the reality of queer life in Britain. It is, in its own way, her version of <em>Small Lives</em> by Pierre Michon, which told the stories of various characters from his family&rsquo;s ancient history and of the peripheral figures from his hometown whose lives would have usually been considered too insignificant for literature &ndash; a servant, a hobo, a peasant priest.<br /><br />In Jacques&rsquo; version, it&rsquo;s a combination of class and marginalisation based on sexual orientation. &ldquo;A Wo/Man of No Importance&rdquo;, the story of Arthur Parr, fictitious contemporary of Oscar Wilde, is a pretext for a highly camp journey into Wilde&rsquo;s trial against the Marquess of Queensberry, his fight for the respect of his queer contemporaries, and the right to live a life without labels. My favourite is &ldquo;Standards of Care&rdquo;, the fictionalised diary of a transgender woman called Sandy, living in Manchester, whose backstory is glam rock fandom and the development of punk culture around 1977.</p> <h2>Queer socialist utopia</h2> <p>Glam was an obvious refuge for queers, who could experiment with drag, crossdressing and identity without being necessarily spat at on the street (which happens to many of the other characters). Sandy frequents a clinic in London to be assessed for gender correction surgery. There she meets Elena and other transgender women whose devotion to music and bravery in self-expression unite them.<br /><br />Culture, along with makeup and clothes, plays just as important a role in these stories as radical politics. The queerness of the characters is never their most important attribute and the period details are rigorously researched. &ldquo;Exhibition&rdquo;, for instance, is an epistolary story set in 1939 Blackpool, where the woman-born, man-identifying protagonist spends two months in the House of Curiosities by the seaside promenade. There, he performs a reality-TV-like show, watched from behind a glass &ndash; as a desperate ploy to make money, but also as an attempt to finally live as who he feels he is, in the face of the very society denying him his identity. <br /><br /><em>Variations</em> must be the only book in the world to mention the mid-century social research project &ldquo;Mass Observation&rdquo; in the same breath as the 1970s glam rock inventors and eager crossdressers, the New York Dolls, along with countless other snippets of life and culture, a large canvas on which the pattern for a utopian socialist queer life might be inscribed. This is a touching, delightful collection from a vital voice, making you want to struggle for a different world.</p> <p><em>This piece is from New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="Claire Tomalin (copyright: Angus Muir)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Claire-Tomalin-NEW-2011-credit-Angus-Muir.jpg" height="851" width="1277" /></em></p> <p><em>Claire Tomalin was the literary editor at the </em>New Statesman<em>, and then later at the </em>Sunday Times<em>. She then embarked on successful career as a full-time writer. Her first book, "The Life and Death of Mary Wollstonecraft", won the Whitbread First Book Award, and she has since written a number of highly acclaimed, award-winning and bestselling biographies. They include: "Jane Austen: A Life", and "Charles Dickens: A Life". Tomalin's latest book is "The Young H.G. Wells: Changing the World".</em></p> <p><strong>As a teenager, at Uppark, Sussex, H.G. Wells had the good fortune of discovering the work of many great writers and thinkers. How important was that formative moment in shaping his artistic and intellectual abilities later on?</strong></p> <p>The experience of finding those books at Uppark was absolutely crucial in Wells's life. His mother was a servant in a gentry country house there. And when visiting his mother, Wells suddenly found he had access to an extraordinary range of books from the library he found in the servants&rsquo; quarters. He discovered the works of Plato, Voltaire, Thomas Paine, and Jonathan Swift. One of the fascinating things about Wells is that he came from poverty. But this formative reading moment opened up his mind to a whole new world of ideas and possibilities.</p> <p><strong>Was Wells a working class hero?</strong></p> <p>He knew that he was getting out of the working class. He said to his mother: "If you could make me be a draper's apprentice, then I will stay as a draper's apprentice forever, but if you let me go to school and study at university, I will rise up." And that is what happened.</p> <p><strong>Wells is often credited as being a kind of father figure for the science fiction genre. Why were books like <em>The Time Machine</em> (1895) and <em>The War of the Worlds</em> (1898) considered so fresh and modern at the time they were published?</strong></p> <p>They are just marvellous stories that are vividly and plainly well written. Wells also had an extraordinary imagination. He deserves to be regarded as a great, great English storyteller.</p> <p><strong>Many critics often draw distinctions between Wells's science fiction work and his literary realism. The general consensus seems to be the science fiction was far better. Do you agree?</strong></p> <p>A book like <em>Joan and Peter </em>(1918), for example, is okay, but it's much more like a conventional English novel, and doesn't approach the thrill of those early [science fiction stories]. Why that happened I cannot say. I suppose Wells just got old and lost his sparkle.</p> <p><strong>Wells also wrote a great deal of polemical non-fiction. Your biography look at books like <em>Anticipations </em>(1901), where Wells was making a claim to forecast the future in areas like transport, social activities, education, and warfare. And <em>Misery Boots</em> (1907): a political tract advocating socialism. Were these two books his strongest works of non-fiction?</strong></p> <p><em>Misery Boots</em> is a wonderful political pamphlet. And <em>Anticipations</em> is absolutely terrific too. I wouldn't be able to say which is the best. They are just all very interesting and impressive. When people like George Bernard Shaw, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb read Wells, they realised how extraordinary he was. Which is why they were so keen to get him into the Fabian Society.</p> <p><strong>Wells's relationship with the Fabian Society was controversial. Why did he fall out with them?</strong></p> <p>He was overly ambitious. He wanted to to enlarge The Fabian Society, and he wanted to change it by spending a lot of money. But Beatrice and Sidney Webb [who were early members of the organisation], and many others, realised this was not a realistic scheme. The Fabian Society was very influential. But it wasn't rich. So that was part of the problem. And then Wells had an affair with Amber Reeves, who was a the daughter of William Pember Reeves and Maud Pember Reeves: two prominent members of the Fabian Society. This sexual scandal was regarded as unacceptable.</p> <p><strong>Wells married twice, first to his cousin, Isabel Mary Wells, before beginning an affair with Amy Catherine Robbins, who he later married. But Wells had many other lovers throughout his life. Could he be cruel in love, or did he just have a very open attitude to relationships and sex?</strong></p> <p>I think Wells didn't mean to be cruel to the women he was with. But he did have this very powerful attraction to women. He was also absolutely insistent on having sexual freedom. Wells wanted everything. He wanted to have a lovely loyal wife, who could entertain his friends at home. But he also wanted to have a passionate love affairs. Actually, he got most of what he wanted.</p> <p><strong>Was there one particular romantic affair Wells embarked on that stands out to you as especially passionate or intense?</strong></p> <p>The affair with the English writer, Rebecca West, was very long drawn out, and probably the most intense affair of Wells's life. That's partially why I stopped the book before that period of his life. It's a whole new chapter, and that's been written about, in depth, by many people. And, of course, West was such a powerful woman herself. But Wells's affair with Amber Reeves was very interesting too. She was this beautiful young student at Cambridge. She really initiated the affair, and asked Wells to make her pregnant. If you read the letters between both of them they are extraordinary. Long afterwards, when she was happily married, she always retained her feelings for him.</p> <p><strong>Wells's bibliography contains an impressive 3,000 items, including more than 100 books. He was quite a hard worker and extremely prolific with his pen it seems?</strong></p> <p>At one stage of his writing career Wells was churning out 7,000 words a day. It almost seemed like he had a team of writers working for him. This was an extraordinary side to his working life: how much writing he actually produced. He also had the capacity to do lots of other things. He had an intense energy. As well as writing, he was engaged in all sorts of travel. And, of course, he was engaged in many relationships with many different women.</p> <p><strong>You've written biographies documenting the lives of writers like Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Thomas Hardy. How does Wells's life compare to them? Was it more eventful and interesting?</strong></p> <p>Well my first biography was on the life of Mary Wollstonecraft. She had a pretty eventful life. So too did Charles Dickens. I've enjoyed writing about Wells, but I'm not sure if his life was more interesting than any of the other writers I've written about. Wells lived through very interesting times. But then so too did those other writers I've written about.</p> <p><strong>What is the secret to writing a great biography?</strong></p> <p>Each biography one embarks on is like forming a close friendship, or close relationship, and trying to be as understanding and tolerant as you can, so you can then investigate as much as you can into that person's life. Of course, you can't catch everything. Nobody can catch everything about another person's life.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

At many points, it felt as if the doomed 2020 had stretched well into 2021. The media continued to bear bad news, and reflections on the experience of grief, isolation, polarisation and other features of our social landscape continued to surface in everyday discussions. But so too did stories of hope and empowerment, along with heartening developments in science and technology. At <em>New Humanist</em>, we continued to shine a light on worrying trends in our "post-truth" era, championing reason and free inquiry at a time when these principles are under great threat. In our Top 20 articles of the year, our authors engage with these themes and much more. We have also included episodes from our podcast <a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061"><em>With Reason</em></a>. We hope you enjoy these as much as we have.</p> <p>***</p> <p>1. <a href="/articles/5841/blasphemy-in-the-classroom">Blasphemy in the classroom</a> by Emma Park</p> <p>In March, a grammar school in Kent was targeted by protestors angry at a teacher's showing of a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad. Soon after, Emma Park began to reflect on what this said about the state of free expression in Britain, and the all important question of how religious iconography is differently interpreted.</p> <p>3. <a href="/articles/5891/of-beasts-and-men">Of beasts and men</a> by Julian Baggini</p> <p>Parliament has been debating an Animal Sentience Bill that could finally see animals officially recognised as sentient creatures. It's high time this happened, Julian Baggini writes, but it doesn't provide the basis for an argument that meat-eating is a special kind of evil.</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NEW_HUMANIST_WINTER_2v1aw2small.jpg" height="372" alt="NEW_HUMANIST_WINTER_2v1aw2small" width="494" /></p> <p>4. <a href="/articles/5802/our-national-need-for-grief">Our national need for grief</a> by Samira Ahmed</p> <p>The pandemic cast a huge blanket of grief over Britain. Yet it feels like the tens of thousands of sudden deaths haven't been properly marked.</p> <p>5. <a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/4398ad6427f6c3a8207b3ed667934a4b78058210/view">Writing and recovery</a>: an interview with Michael Rosen</p> <p>In early 2020, the poet and author Michael Rosen almost died from Covid-19. He used his recuperation to reflect on the value of kindness, touch and practical atheism, and later spoke with New Humanist about the immorality of government decision-making around the pandemic.</p> <p>6. <a href="/articles/5784/talking-to-ourselves">Talking to Ourselves</a> by Jon Moses</p> <p>When we pay them heed, our inner voices can shape our lives. They tell us what we should think, and how we should behave. But, writes Jon Moses, they have long been understudied. Should that change?</p> <p>7. <a href="/articles/5859/power-shapes-human-health-and-infectious-diseases-shape-power">Disease and power</a>: a Q&amp;A with Kyle Harper</p> <p>Several transformations in human history - the development of agriculture, the rise of cities, international travel - triggered profound changes in the way diseases evolve and pass between humans. Dr Kyle Harper, author of <em>Plagues Upon the Earth: Disease and the Course of Human History, </em>gave us an overview of how we have shaped disease, and how it has shaped us.</p> <p>8. <a href="/articles/5827/lying-eyes">Lying Eyes</a> by Gayan Samarisinghe</p> <p>Judges, juries, prosecutors and courtroom audiences can't but help look at the expressions of defendents to glean clues as to their guilt or innocence. But this is not only unscientific, writes Gayan Samarisinghe. It is a major cause of bias in criminal trials.</p> <p>2. <a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/9ecf3706689beab926e28b8ce15b6ca0f96fcf91/view">How to fix the internet</a>: an interview with Chris Bail</p> <p>Online tribalism is a growing threat, with real implications for offline safety. Chris Bail, head of the Polarization Lab, shared his thoughts on what strategies can best be used to tackle the problem.</p> <p>9. <a href="/articles/5846/why-does-every-hollywood-baddie-need-a-redemption-story">Scraping the Barrel</a> by James Robins</p> <p>A Hollywood film on the life and times of Cruella de Ville has flattened a complex villain into a likeable, redeemable character. But why do directors need to deliver feelgood stories, James Robins asks?</p> <p>10. <a href="/articles/5899/the-curious-mind-of-a-dog">The curious mind of a dog</a> by Cal Flyn</p> <p>Several years ago, a speech pathologist began to wonder whether the strategies she uses to develop language skills in her young patients could be adapted in order to train dogs to "talk". As Cal Flyn found out, the results have been astonishing.</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistDog-small1.jpg" height="480" alt="NewHumanistDog-small1" width="535" /></p> <p>11. <a href="/articles/5857/a-good-death">A good death</a> by Jem Bartholomew</p> <p>Current laws around assisted dying in the UK mean that people who want to legally and painlessly end their lives have to travel abroad. But the tide is beginning to turn, writes Jem Bartholomew in a feature on the life, and death, of Rebecca Drury.</p> <p>12. <a href="/articles/5763/inside-diyarbak%C4%B1r-the-city-of-the-silenced">Inside Diyarbakir, the city of the silenced</a> by Sami Kent</p> <p>Diyarbakir is Turkey&rsquo;s biggest Kurdish city, and its recent history is one marked by violence and unrelenting state oppression. But it also where the development of a recognisably 21st-century Kurdish city has found powerful expression, as Sami Kent discovered.</p> <p>13. <a href="/articles/5821/qa-ac-grayling">Q&amp;A with A.C. Grayling</a> by Niki Seth-Smith</p> <p>"I&rsquo;ve always said that humanism is an ethical outlook," A.C. Grayling told us earlier this year, "which has its roots in Classical antiquity and which pretty well all reflective people have held close, right the way through the history of philosophy."</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/oz1.jpg" height="432" alt="oz1" width="532" /></p> <p>14. <a href="/articles/5773/australias-dance-with-death">Australia's dance with death</a> by Peter Salmon</p> <p>As with neurosis in an individual&rsquo;s psyche, Peter Salmon reflected, a neurosis in the psyche of a nation can battle on, impervious to the facts. Australia's position on looming environmental collapse is just such an example.</p> <p>15. <a href="https://podfollow.com/1540797061/episode/646f1bfd4c2adf1ec42391021aafc62ee374200f/view">The Cosmos &amp; Us</a>: an interview with Jo Marchant</p> <p>What do we gain when we look to the skies? How has cosmology shaped our politics? And why is awe a feeling that we can&rsquo;t afford to lose? We spoke about this, and more, in a podcast with the science writer Jo Marchant.</p> <p>16. <a href="/articles/5816/remember-me">Remember me</a> by Laurie Taylor</p> <p>Laurie Taylor spent much of the past year contacting old pals in the hope that long-dead friendships could be reborn. For the most part, he was wildly unsuccessful, and he came to learn a hard truth: they had gotten on just fine without him.</p> <p>17. <a href="/articles/5900/qa-eimear-mcbride">Q&amp;A with Eimear McBride</a> by J. P. O'Malley</p> <p>The Irish novelist, whose book <em>A Girl Is A Half-formed Thing</em> won the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize in 2013, spoke to us about objectification and disgust in representations of, and conversations around, women's bodies.</p> <p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Eimar_McBride_&copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall1.jpg" height="328" alt="Eimar_McBride_&copy;Sophie_Bassoulssmall1" width="492" /></p> <p>18. <a href="/articles/5854/patron-saint-of-doom">Patron saint of doom</a> by Tom Whyman</p> <p>Like many of us, Tom Whyman found the pandemic period to be full of dispiriting news. But after returning to the work of Arthur Schopenhauer, he understood that hope lay in properly interrogating the pessimistic mind.</p> <p>19. <a href="/articles/5831/secrets-in-the-soil">Secrets in the soil</a> by Kate Brown</p> <p>Our problem of ravaged soils is one of the oldest in the history of agriculture. But having tried her hand at farming on disturbed urban territory, Kate Brown found reason to be optimistic about the future of the ground beneath our feet.</p> <p>20. <a href="/articles/5847/shutting-down-websites-used-by-sex-workers-is-part-of-a-dangerous-trend">Adult enterprise</a> by Ray Filar</p> <p>Some anti-sex-worker campaigners believe that criminalisation will &ldquo;end demand&rdquo; from would-be sex buyers. Part of this push is the shutting down of websites used by sex workers. But, as Ray Filar discovered, resistance against this campaign is growing.</p> <p>To all of our readers: <em>Felice anno nuovo!</em></p> <p>And to those of you who don't yet subscribe, why not head into 2022 with a fresh new subscription to <em>New Humanist </em>magazine.

Both in Latin and French, God was talked of as a &ldquo;refuge&rdquo;, a protector. Geoffrey Chaucer often marks an arrival of a French word into common English usage. In his <em>Knight&rsquo;s Tale</em> (c.1405), we find the phrase, &ldquo;Give us neither mercy nor refuge, but slay me&rdquo; (modernised spelling).</p> <p class="p4">The Oxford Dictionary lists the first example of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in the modern sense, attached to Protestants who fled religious persecution in France, especially after 1685 and the Edict of Nantes. In 1687, John Evelyn, in his famous <em>Diary, </em>wrote of &ldquo;the poor and religious Refugie&egrave;s [sic] who escaped out of France in the cruel persecution&rdquo;. Even so, a little earlier there are references to &ldquo;poor refugees in Norwich, Colchester, Sandwich, Maidstone and Southampton&rdquo;, a reminder that places some think of as &ldquo;pure English&rdquo; (whatever that means) have had their share of migrants from as far back as the 17th century. Daniel Defoe used the word in 1724, presumably in the knowledge that his readers were familiar with it, talking of &ldquo;the people call&rsquo;d refugees&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p4">In the slippery way that we all enjoy, we find writers using the word metaphorically or hyperbolically. A migratory bird could be described as a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; (1764); Lawrence Durrell, in <em>Justine</em> (1957), wrote: &ldquo;You are a mental refugee of course, being Irish.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">As we know only too well, the word can also be used in an inversion of its customary sense when the person is deemed unworthy: a refugee from the law and due punishment. This idea has been around since at least the 18th century. One Lady Miller, writing in 1777, first described refugees as &ldquo;robbers and murderers&rdquo;, before adding: &ldquo;The soldiers seize the refugees and bring them to justice.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p4">What&rsquo;s not clear from Lady Miller&rsquo;s writing is whether this outcome was better or worse than having your dinghy turned round in the English Channel in 2021 and sent back to France.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
