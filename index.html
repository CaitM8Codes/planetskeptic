            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">I have to start teaching in-person on Tuesday, and I&#8217;ve laid in a supply of N94 and N95 masks in my office, which now leads to an unfortunate consequence: to fit well, the beard had to go. I shaved it off yesterday.</p>
<p>This is horrible. I have relied on that beard to hide half my homely face for decades now, and suddenly I&#8217;m naked and exposed. At least when I&#8217;m out and about I get to cover it with a big mask, which helps. But worse, I&#8217;m used to having a face covered with the downy soft fur of a kitten, a <em>pleasant</em> tactile sensation. This morning I woke up with a sandpaper face. <em>Coarse</em> sandpaper. Something I could use to strip corrosion off of rusted iron girders. I just shaved again (I have to do this every day now?) ten minutes ago and it just feels like I&#8217;ve switch to a finer grit.</p>
<p>How do you clean-shaven men bear it? When did our culture decide this barbarous custom of shearing off our soothing soft pelts was <i>de rigueur</i>? I&#8217;m feeling oppressed already. This is sex based discrimination! I have to carry the burden of artificial depilation now, just to keep this stupid virus away from my respiratory system.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Do you feel like moving to Minnesota? The <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-goose-capital-free-land-beer-cable-agassiz-wildlife-refuge-thief-river-hunting/600135577/">town of Middle River has an offer for you</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>Attention waterfowl hunters who dream about moving closer to marshlands north and west. The goose capital of Minnesota will award you seven-tenths of an acre inside its city limits if you move there and build a house.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right: Zero down, zero interest and zero payments on a roomy 100-by-300-foot lot in Middle River, a town of 300 people set between Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge and the state&#8217;s well-known Thief Lake Wildlife Management Area. That&#8217;s a combined 182 square miles of breeding grounds and habitat for ducks, geese, shorebirds, song birds, raptors, deer, bear, wild turkeys, grouse, wolves and more.</p>
<p>The incentives don&#8217;t stop there. Under the civic growth program launched in 2018 and expanded last year, the welcome packet sponsored by this outdoors-minded community also includes a one-year membership to the local Sportsmen&#8217;s Club, a free building permit, two free years of municipal water and sewer, free electric hookup, three months of free cable TV, a $100 gift certificate to the local tavern, and a free, 12-month subscription to The Honker, the community&#8217;s newspaper.</p></blockquote>
<p>Free land? Free beer at the local (and probably only) tavern? How can you turn that down?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only 340km (200 miles) due north of Morris, and the current temperature is a balmy -15Â°C. They don&#8217;t mention it, but there&#8217;s probably good ice fishing up there. It&#8217;s almost Canada!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="(Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/forbes.jpg" height="589" width="805" /></p> <p>Legend has it that, on the morning of 28 February 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick blew into the Eagle pub in Cambridge proclaiming to the regulars and the world, &ldquo;We have discovered the Secret of Life.&rdquo; They weren&rsquo;t crazy &ndash; the molecular biologists had discovered the structure of DNA, which instantly suggested, as their paper in the journal <em>Nature</em> would put it a few months later, &ldquo;a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material&rdquo;. <br /><br />The DNA molecule, they proposed, was a very long double helix: two strands intertwined like a twisted ladder, with the bases linking up as the rungs holding the strands together. This molecule could reproduce itself by unzipping the two strands and adding the complementary bases to make two new double helixes identical to the original. They had discovered, in outline, how living things manage to reproduce themselves so faithfully.<br /><br />In the 1960s, there was further revelation: we discovered that the bases also constituted another code. This provided the blueprint for the production of the very many proteins that do all the major work in our living cells. Today, every one of the 3 billion bases in human DNA has been fully sequenced. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ve cracked the Secret of Life. Understanding that it is DNA that transmits the hereditary information and makes proteins was a great breakthrough. But a puzzle remained: for all the insight we have gained into the reproduction of genetic material, it still didn&rsquo;t answer a fundamental question, one that has dogged scientists for centuries: how is an animal built? In other words, once the design is in place, how does the construction happen? <br /><br />We might think of a symphony, where the DNA constitutes the score. The symphony of life &ndash; &ldquo;endless forms most beautiful&rdquo; in Darwin&rsquo;s words &ndash; is created from this DNA code or sequence, this &ldquo;score&rdquo;. You can reproduce a Beethoven symphony by photocopying the score, but that doesn&rsquo;t tell you how musical instruments and human hands and brains work to turn the notes into living music. What instructs a human, for example, to grow its arms and legs and fingers and toes &ndash; all derived originally from a single cell?<br /><br />This extract from the 2005 poem &ldquo;The Spirit Is Too Blunt an Instrument&rdquo; by Anne Stevenson tells us how it&rsquo;s not done:<br /><br />The spirit is too blunt an instrument<br />to have made this baby.<br />Nothing so unskilful as human passions<br />could have managed the intricate<br />exacting particulars &hellip;<br /><br />But some great principle of biological engineering does create &ldquo;intricate exacting particulars&rdquo;. Clearly, it&rsquo;s not achieved by the human spirit, God or abracadabra. Rather, as we&rsquo;ll see, it is governed by particular protein products of the DNA: a class of chemical agent known as a morphogen, a generator of form.</p> <h2>The fundamental &ldquo;bricks&rdquo; of life</h2> <p>To understand how morphogens work we need to start with the fundamental &ldquo;bricks&rdquo; of life: the cells. Living things can only develop by means of cells dividing into two and then two again, and so forth. To learn how to build an animal, we therefore need to investigate the properties of these &ldquo;bricks&rdquo;. Biochemically and physiologically, there are many different kinds of cell, but they all look more or less the same. The biochemist Nick Lane puts it like this: &ldquo;I challenge you to look at one of your own cells down a microscope and distinguish it from the cells of a mushroom. They are practically identical.&rdquo; <br /><br />Given that we always start from a single living cell, let&rsquo;s pose what seems a manageable question: how do animals acquire four limbs and their attached appendages? We have already shown how DNA can be imagined as a score, a blueprint or a building plan. Without such a plan, dividing cells would simply produce a constantly expanding ball. Of course, that&rsquo;s not what happens. Cells divide more in one direction than another, breaking the symmetry of what would otherwise be a sphere, and creating the shape of the animal. <br /><br />The most basic plan for an animal is a trunk with four limbs. All living things have to eat, and, unlike some primitive bacteria that can live off mere raw chemicals, animals have to eat other preformed creatures. Some tiny creatures are just a sausage-tube with a front and back: the front is the end that ingests the food; the end is where waste is expelled. But bigger animals need appendages, which eventually appeared in evolution as fins, arms, legs and wings.<br /><br />So, the next schematic stage for our animal is for limbs to grow off that trunk. All the higher animals &ndash; such as amphibians, reptiles, birds, marsupials and mammals &ndash; have four limbs. Why is that so? Because they evolved from fish, which have just two front and two hind-fins. In birds and bats, two of these limbs became wings. In most of the rest, the four limbs all effectively function as legs. In humans, two of them became arms. <br /><br />How does this building process work? A few months before Watson and Crick burst into the Eagle, another great thinker made a discovery that would give us our first clue. Alan Turing &ndash; mathematician, Enigma code-breaker and inventor of the concept of the digital computer &ndash; made a contribution to the Secret of Life that is only now receiving its due recognition. Turing showed theoretically how spreading zones of migrating chemicals could create coloured patterns on the coats of animals, whether they be spots or stripes. They had shape-generating properties, and he called them &ldquo;morphogens&rdquo;. Eat your heart out, Kipling and his <em>Just So</em> story &ldquo;How the Leopard Got His Spots&rdquo;. <br /><br />But the scope of morphogens has expanded dramatically since Turing&rsquo;s pioneering work. They are now understood to help create not only two-dimensional patterns but also three-dimensional forms, such as arms and legs and their terminal digits. They do this by diffusing through developing cells, instructing them to change their character as they go, gradually building the appropriate kinds of cells for each part of the body.</p> <h2>Making our heads, arms and legs</h2> <p>In the late 1960s, a related idea was taken up by the inspirational embryologist Lewis Wolpert, who died in January 2021 aged 91. Wolpert was an imaginative thinker, a great team leader and a vigorous populariser of science in books like <em>The Unnatural Nature of Science</em> (2000). Wolpert suggested the theory that morphogens, as they made their way from their source, diffusing through a growing mass of cells, caused different effects as they travelled further away and their concentration weakened. Near to the source they have one effect; further away a different one. Wolpert called this the &ldquo;French Flag model&rdquo;: one could imagine a &ldquo;French Flag&rdquo; animal that was red at one end, white in the middle and blue at the other end, all produced by the same morphogen. <br /><br />In the 1980s, genes with a related pattern-forming purpose, the hox genes, came into detailed focus, thanks to advances in gene sequencing and manipulation. The protein products of hox genes are &ldquo;super morphogens&rdquo;, specifying the overall body plans of all animals, most significantly the head and the trunk. These super morphogens specify the room plan of the house, if you like, while the morphogens go to work in choosing the kind of cooker, fridge and sink, and decide where they should go in the kitchen.<br /><br />In the early 20th century, we had our first inkling of what happens when a super morphogen goes wrong: fruit flies were found with organs growing on the wrong part of the body &ndash; a leg where an antenna should be, or vice versa. Something that told a leg or antenna where to form was malfunctioning. Now we know that something is a hox gene.<br /><br />So the super morphogen hox genes specify where the shoulder and pelvic girdle start and then another morphogen comes into play. In 1993, the whimsically named morphogen &ldquo;sonic hedgehog&rdquo; (named on account of its relation to the so-called &ldquo;hedgehog genes&rdquo; that produce bristles on flies) was discovered to control the structure-forming gradients in many parts of the body: how wide apart our eyes are, for example; how the limbs develop from those buds off the main trunk, and how many fingers and toes we have. The latter, for example, shows the French Flag model in action, creating a gradient from thumb (&ldquo;blue&rdquo;), through middle fingers (&ldquo;white&rdquo;) to pinkie (&ldquo;red&rdquo;).<br /><br />The function of sonic hedgehog can be seen most clearly in cases where it has been disabled. This happened in Utah in 1957, when sheep were born with a Cyclopean single eye and other deformities. The culprit, identified 10 years later, was a chemical called cyclopamine, found in the plant <em>Veratrum californicum</em>, which the sheep were eating. Drought had driven them to higher pastures where the plant was growing. In the 1980s, cyclopamine was shown to block sonic hedgehog. <br /><br />We saw an equivalent case in humans with the drug thalidomide. Widely prescribed to pregnant women in Europe between 1957 and 1961 as a treatment for nausea, the drug interfered with the working of sonic hedgehog. Before thalidomide was withdrawn, it caused all manner of birth defects, including hands that grew from the shoulders. But even in normal development, sonic hedgehog sometimes gets it wrong: people with six or seven digits occur in one out of 700-1000 live births.</p> <h2>"Just a very large clitoris"</h2> <p>If morphogens and hox genes can seem a bit abstract, the way that nature sculpts an animal comes vividly into focus when we get to the business end: the genitals. &ldquo;La diff&eacute;rence&rdquo; maybe, but in developmental terms the male and female genitals are really all of a piece, woven from the same tissue. Only very small changes at the molecular level distinguish the male testosterone from the female oestrogen. It&rsquo;s quite hard to spot the difference unless you&rsquo;re a chemist.<br /><br />In the developing foetus, it is the sex hormones, acting as morphogens, that build either the female or male genitalia from the same original tissues. In the early embryo, the primordial organs, so far undifferentiated, become male or female depending on the signal from one or other of the so-similar hormones. Once development has finished, switching hormones can accentuate or diminish secondary sexual characteristics but they cannot reverse the plumbing. That requires surgery. So it&rsquo;s either labia or scrotum, clitoris or penis, ovaries or testes (which are formed in the male in the same place in the stomach as the ovaries but which then descend into the scrotal sac). The default is the female form.<br /><br />Remember that animal forms can only be produced by cells dividing and moving in one direction rather than another. So the scrotal sac is just a large hollow version of the labia, with a sealed seam where the vagina would be. Indeed, the whole appendage of which males are so proud is just a very large clitoris with the urethra diverted down the middle, and a connection to the testes and the prostate gland. <br /><br />The ingenious plasticity of most of these processes is highlighted by the bizarre case of the spotted hyena, which gives birth through the clitoris. How evolution succeeded with this apparently grotesquely malformed plumbing is a mystery. Birth this way is hard: 60 per cent of the firstborn hyenas and 9 per cent of their mothers die at birth. It sounds like a challenge to Darwin, but despite its extreme reproductive strategy, the spotted hyena is an abundant, successful species. <br /><br />The growth of an animal is a cascade: once it gets going, it can&rsquo;t stop. But it can go wrong. Timing and positioning are a large part of the developmental process. Because many processes can only be turned on at the correct time in development, a wrong turn early on cannot later be made good. The reason that thalidomide wreaked such deadly and lasting damage is that the sonic hedgehog morphogen is busy patterning the limbs during weeks five and six of gestation, when the pregnant mothers were taking the drug. <br /><br />Just as there is no one Secret of Life, many processes are brought to bear to hone and fine-tune the actions of morphogens like sonic hedgehog. Building an animal is a concerted job between the genes, the protein-signalling morphogens, the different kinds of cells they produce and the messenger molecules on their surfaces. There is a powerful analogy with language here. The linguist Guy Deutscher, in <em>The Unfolding of Language</em> (2005), shows how language evolved its complexity by a process akin to biological evolution: &ldquo;Languages have&hellip; developed a range of&hellip; techniques to help make the bricks stick, such as the use of various adhesives which facilitate the construction of much more complex edifices.&rdquo;</p> <h2>From a single egg to the finished animal</h2> <p>Our knowledge of how to build an animal is still very broad-brush. Recent work, reported in <em>Science</em> magazine, sheds new light on the fine-tuning of the construction technique. Working with zebrafish, scientists have found that sonic hedgehog patterning is actually a bit sloppy, but that it interacts with and is fine-tuned by interactions with the proteins that stick cells together. These cell adhesion proteins also specify cell types and they make sure that the broad pattern laid down by sonic hedgehog, at least most of the time, produces the correct result. In the zebrafish experiment, they were found to produce the 13 pre-patterning &ldquo;stripes&rdquo; that parcel out the early spinal cord &ndash; not only in zebrafish, but in all vertebrates. In humans they also ensure, most of the time, that we have 20 tiny fingers and 20 tiny toes.<br /><br />When the successful completion of the Human Genome Project, the international mission to map and understand our DNA, was announced at a White House press conference in 2000, President Clinton told the world that &ldquo;Today we are learning the language in which God created life.&rdquo; He said that the genome was the &ldquo;book of life&rdquo; which we could now decode &ndash; &ldquo;the most wondrous map ever produced by humankind&rdquo;. In fact, the genome was only 83 per cent complete at the time. But even if it had been fully complete, as it is now, Clinton would have been jumping the gun. DNA is only one piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />The DNA sequence of any organism&rsquo;s total complement of genes, the genome, is fundamental, but how it functions at different stages in the development &ndash; from a single egg to the finished animal &ndash; is intricately subtle. This article has covered a few prime examples of this. They were mostly surprises; many unknown unknowns still await us on this quest. <br /><br />So where do we find the Secret of Life? It turns out that there isn&rsquo;t one. In evolving life&rsquo;s complexity over four billion years, many processes have been deployed. Let&rsquo;s call them &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; then &ndash; although a growing number aren&rsquo;t secrets any more.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-_9_.jpg" height="515" alt="image" width="689" /><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>The Wordhord: Daily Life in Old English</strong> (Profile Books) by Hana Videen</p> <p>Does the &ldquo;Old English&rdquo; language really deserve the name? Sure, it&rsquo;s old &ndash; it was spoken in some form between the 6th and 12th centuries &ndash; and sure, it&rsquo;s the ancestor of the English we speak today. It was certainly spoken in England and the etymological link between the names of the Englisc and English language is also clear enough. <br /><br />Yet to presume that the English we speak today is simply an updated version of the English spoken in the early mediaeval period risks obscuring the otherness of Old English. In fact, this Germanic language was transformed by contact with the Romance language of Norman French after 1066, creating the unique hybrid that we know today.<br /><br />&ldquo;Wordhord&rdquo; is an actual term from Old English literature. Heroes like Beowulf are said to &ldquo;onleac&rdquo; (&ldquo;unlock&rdquo;) their precious hoard of words on speaking at weighty, important occasions. Hana Videen&rsquo;s book grew out of her tweeting an Old English word every day and there is an app accompanying <em>The Wordhord</em> that allows users to browse selected treasures from her hoard of words. Her &ldquo;hord-wynn&rdquo; (&ldquo;hoard-joy&rdquo;) in sharing her precious treasures is infectious. But the book is more than just a list of words. She turns them into the story of how Old English speakers saw the world and what mattered to them.<br /><br />Sometimes our Old English ancestors seem familiar, sometimes not. We encounter numerous &ldquo;false friends&rdquo; that do not lead us where we think we are going: &ldquo;DrÄam&rdquo; means &ldquo;joy&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;bÄd-hÅ«s&rdquo; is a place of worship, not a dormitory. Where old and new align, the older might be more expansive: a &ldquo;lÄac&rdquo; could be any plant, not just a leek, while a &ldquo;dÄor&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t only a deer but can be any animal. <br /><br />The surviving Old English wordhord is modest in size. There are only 200 partially or wholly Old English manuscripts, the majority dating from the 10th and 11th centuries and containing some 3.5 million words. That means scholars like Videen are faced with numerous words or compounds that are only known from a single instance in a single manuscript. These do, however, include numerous suggestive compounds that are all the more precious for their uniqueness: &ldquo;symbel-gÄl&rdquo;, or &ldquo;feast-lustful&rdquo;, whereby one is so satiated from the pleasures of food and drink that they cannot focus on the state of their soul; or &ldquo;Än-stapa&rdquo;, &ldquo;one-stepper&rdquo;, a person who walks alone. <br /><br />It is compounds like this that are the most exciting finds in the book, particularly when they take the form of kennings. Kennings combine two ordinary nouns to create metaphors rich in allusive power. They range from the comic to the gnomic, including &ldquo;bÄn-loca&rdquo; (&ldquo;bone-locker&rdquo;, or body), &ldquo;fisces be&thorn;&rdquo; (&ldquo;fish&rsquo;s bath&rdquo;, or sea) and &ldquo;gongle-wÇ£fre&rdquo; (&ldquo;walking weaver&rdquo;, or spider).</p> <h2>Old English word-making</h2> <p>But while Videen&rsquo;s book allows us to appreciate the expressiveness and creativity of Old English word-making and literature, she largely avoids confronting the reader with a major source of Old English otherness. Languages are not simply wordhords, they require grammatical scaffolding. And it is grammatically that the impact of Norman French on English is seen most dramatically. Like other Germanic languages, Old English was an inflected language in which nouns and other words were marked by case &ndash; suffixes that indicate the syntactical function of the word (in modern English, prepositions like &ldquo;with&rdquo; or &ldquo;by&rdquo; perform this function). The collision between Germanic and Romance largely swept cases away. When today&rsquo;s native English speaker tries to learn Icelandic, German, Finnish &ndash; or, for that matter, Old English &ndash; it is the case system that provides one of the first challenges. <br /><br />But Videen does not claim her book is a guide to Old English. Rather, as she states, it is for her a source of the &ldquo;wynn-drÄam&rdquo; &ndash; intense and visceral joy &ndash; that comes from both connecting with the Old English-speaking past and mining that past to find new ways of expressing things that humans have always felt.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

News of the death travelled from the Carterets &ndash; a chain of beautiful coral atolls &ndash; to Bougainville, one of the main islands, where Father Benedict lives in a small community nestled in the lush tropical forests. Soon after, one of his relatives had a dream in which he said it was &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; that sorcery had been responsible for the death. Later, more &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; supporting this was found in the rainforest &ndash; a local youth had been caught engaging in what appeared to be ritual practices. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Father Benedict&rsquo;s family members urged him to take action against the youth accused of having worked the sorcery, despite a hospital certificate stating that cancer was the cause. Consumed by grief, Father Benedict hesitated, struggling with real doubts as to what, or who, was to blame for his father&rsquo;s death, and how to respond.<br /><br />According to the Witchcraft and Human Rights Information Network, there have been over 20,000 victims of accusations of witchcraft and related harmful practices over the last decade, spread across 60 countries. The research, published in November 2020, includes reports of over 5,250 murders, 60 disappearances in suspicious circumstances, and 14,700 attempted killings and physical attacks. While Papua New Guinea suffers disproportionately from the phenomenon, many parts of Africa and India also have high rates. Wealthier countries in the west are affected too. In 2019 the number of children known to have been abused in England as a result of beliefs in witchcraft and possession was reported to have risen by a third in two years, with almost 2,000 identified victims.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>And this may be only the tip of the iceberg. Irrespective of where it takes place, these crimes are often hidden due to ignorance, shame and stigma, making comprehensive figures extremely difficult to generate. Emerging data, however, paint a disturbing picture of an ongoing, widespread and systemic form of violence that takes many different forms, depending on the part of the world. Alongside murders and physical attacks, there are also cases of grave desecrations and human trafficking. Women trafficked for witchcraft purposes are often silenced through being forced to take a ritual oath. They believe that breaking the oath by, for example, alerting the police will subject them and their families to revenge from the spirit world.<br /><br />In July, the significance of this complex and global issue was finally officially recognised in an historical resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council. The UNHRC emphatically condemned harmful practices related to accusations of witchcraft and ritual attacks that result in human rights violations. Will the phenomenon finally garner the attention needed to tackle it on the ground? How can we help stop sorcery accusation-related violence &ndash; or SARV, as it is often called?</p> <h2 class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">The fear and violence of witchcraft accusations</span></h2> <p class="p4">I&rsquo;m part of a research team working to tackle SARV in Papua New Guinea. We estimate that, nationally, six people are killed every month, and a further 23 suffer serious harm, including permanent injury. Our team comprises academics from the PNG National Research Institute and the Divine Word University in Madang, working with a network of local activists. We are a disparate group, including film makers, gender specialists and Catholic priests. It&rsquo;s important for us to work alongside people of the Catholic faith, as this is the largest religious group in Papua New Guinea, comprising roughly 26 per cent of the population.<br /><br />Our investigation has documented systemic and ongoing fear, violence and death resulting from accusations of sorcery in the country. Almost every accusation leads to ongoing shame and stigma and increased likelihood of future accusations. In almost a third of the cases documented it has led to physical violence or property damage. This violence is often very public. It involves acts of torture, such as burning with heated machetes, that are often carried out over many days, if not weeks, and that literally take place within the public square. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>I&rsquo;ve sat in boats and on the back of trucks and under trees hearing people&rsquo;s stories about the impact these accusations have had on their lives. Heartbreakingly, one survivor demanded I tell her the secret to removing the &ldquo;stain&rdquo; of a sorcery accusation that followed her everywhere. Another silently showed me her scars with tears rolling down her cheeks. Many victims either cannot access support services or choose not to go to the police or hospital for fear of further reprisals. Impunity for these offences is widespread.<br /><br />Yet accusations do not always have to lead to violent incidents. Let&rsquo;s return for a moment to Father Benedict. When he heard the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of sorcery, he was thrown into doubt. After three days of prayer, he readied his mind and returned home to the Carterets. It was no easy journey to these islands, which are slowly sinking under the rising seas, requiring many transitions in and out of small boats. In many ways, his spiritual journey was even more arduous. &ldquo;There was hatred and revenge from the members of our community, and pressure from them [to take revenge for his father&rsquo;s death],&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Early on, I was very angry too [about the possibility of sorcery] but I prayed about it and thought about what was the best way to settle it in a peaceful way, and I let time pass.&rdquo; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>After much reflection, Father Benedict publicly refuted the claims that the death was caused by sorcery, and buried his father with full Catholic rites. Drawing upon his spiritual leadership, he worked with the local chiefs and village court magistrates to reconcile with the youth who had been accused, blessing water as a symbol of cleansing from both sides, and ritually shaking hands. Violence was averted, relationships restored, amity returned to this small atoll chain.</p> <h2 class="p4">Mutating like a virus</h2> <p class="p4">What can be done to help ensure more cases of sorcery accusation end in peace and reconciliation? A first step must be greater understanding. For example, the primary victims of witch-hunts are often assumed to be marginalised women, while there are in fact many classes of victim. In Papua New Guinea, women and girls are the main victims in the Highlands, while males are more likely to be accused in Bougainville. In some areas, it will be the &ldquo;poisenman&rdquo; who casts his sorcery through sprinkling substances into discarded hair or fingernails, while in others a &ldquo;sanguma&rdquo; (&ldquo;witch&rdquo;) woman is known to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; the heart of her victim. Like a virus, these narratives mutate to adapt to new conditions, as demonstrated in the growing number of stories of &ldquo;sanguma&rdquo; using mobile phones. While the poor and marginalised are often targeted, so are economic or political elites. Witchcraft accusations can be a very effective tool of the powerless, given the difficulty of mounting a defence against them.<br /><br />What explains the prevalence of this trend in some places but not others? As would be expected, a major factor is the presence of a supernatural worldview, but this is by no means a complete explanation. In Vanuatu, a Melanesian archipelago where I used to live and work, sorcery would often be framed as an explanation for everything from unceasing rain to failures of court cases, but these apprehensions very rarely became personalised or violent. Socio-economic factors, including poverty, precarity, new forms of inequality and lack of trust in leaders and institutions, usually play a significant role.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Education in western science is of undoubted importance, but it must be understood as only one part of the solution. Our research with university students in Papua New Guinea supports psychological studies that identify the prevalence of what we term &ldquo;worldview pluralism&rdquo;. While many people understand the world principally through a frame based on scientific, religious or magical principles, it is also common for a number of these frames to coexist in a single individual. Even highly educated members of society do not completely replace one understanding of causality with another. They co-exist, with one emerging as dominant in a given context. In the case of Father Benedict, we saw him tussling with competing causal frameworks dictating different courses of action &ndash; a dilemma he finally resolved in favour of a peaceful approach rooted in his Catholic beliefs.<br /><br />Our research found that one of the most effective strategies to divert accusations from turning violent was to raise doubt about whether sorcery had been used in that particular case. We call this a &ldquo;doubt-based advocacy strategy&rdquo;. Rather than seeking to convince others to reject a particular explanatory framework outright, the aim is to create or extenuate doubt about questions of causality.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Highlighting the potential negative consequences is another feature of this approach. One inspiring youth leader &ndash; a local man who has worked as a recorder on our research project &ndash; explained how he exercised leadership when his father died. His main motivation was to avoid the family and community fracturing that he had often seen following such accusations. &ldquo;Even though I have a cultural belief in sorcery, I still can make decisions not to go down that road,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My brother and his family were pushing me to do something, but I stood strong on my principles.&rdquo;<br /><br />Often those best placed to nudge others away from dangerous stories about sorcery are people from within the group who may themselves have once had an ambivalent relationship to such narratives. These people can provide a bridge between different worldviews, through being an insider and &ldquo;one of us&rdquo;. It overcomes the familiar pushback: &ldquo;Oh, but you just do not know about <span class="s1">our</span> sorcerers.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">Confronting sorcery accusations</h2> <p class="p4">The good news is that the phenomenon is garnering more attention, not only in Papua New Guinea but worldwide. One important step in facilitating such conversations is creating physical spaces in which they can be had, and developing terminology to frame them. In Papua New Guinea the term &ldquo;sorcery accusation-related violence&rdquo; has gained traction since 2013, following concerted attempts to mainstream the terminology by a network of officials, civil society and faith-based organisations. The UN Independent Expert on persons with albinism has spearheaded development of the terminology &ldquo;harmful practices related to accusations of witchcraft and ritual attacks&rdquo;. People with albinism have long been targets for those seeking to use their body parts in a range of ritual practices to overcome everything from male impotency to poverty, and know a thing or two about the dangers such beliefs can create.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>This terminology seeks to emphasise the &ldquo;harmful practices&rdquo; rather than the beliefs themselves, recognising that in many contexts witchcraft and associated beliefs are valued by the majority of the population, particularly in regard to their use in traditional healing. We don&rsquo;t have to share these views to acknowledge their importance when working with particular communities. Here in the United Kingdom, the term &ldquo;child abuse linked to faith or belief&rdquo; has been developed and awareness is being raised around the issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Greater understanding of how to confront sorcery accusations and related violence is not only important in its own right. Frequently characterised by mob justice, competing understandings of causation of events, as well as high levels of fear and uncertainty, our insights into how to deal with this issue can help us develop strategies for tackling many different forms of violence across the globe.<br /><br />What are my main takeaways from my years of research in this field? The most positive finding has been that when accusations are made, community leaders, family members and faith leaders often step in to intervene. They create spaces for dialogue, for airing different perspectives and for calming the panic and anger. A path is found through previously polarised positions. While ending impunity for those who commit violence is important, it is the exercise of leadership in families, communities and national government that is probably our best hope of advancing a non-violent future. This means creating spaces for respectful dialogue and encouraging communities to arrive at peaceful compromise. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>As Father Benedict observed: &ldquo;I came to an understanding that life has to continue. If they [the accusations] do not end they will continue to traumatise me. Because we are being imprisoned by what others think and what we think also . . . and so we just have to be flexible, let go and rest peacefully."<br /><br /><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Mary Whitehouse delivers the Danish script of an &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; film about Jesus to the Home Secretary in 1976 (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/E11A94.jpg" height="685" alt="E11A94" width="900" /></p> <p>The two-minute &ldquo;God slot&rdquo; at 7.50am on Radio 4&rsquo;s Today programme has long seemed anachronistic. At its most benign, &ldquo;Thought for the Day&rdquo; has offered comfortable homilies from the likes of Rabbi Lionel Blue, and while dominated by Anglican and Catholic voices, it is inclusive of several major world religions. But it remains closed to humanists. In my two stints working on the <em>Today </em>programme in the early 90s it was clear that whatever the programme&rsquo;s editors thought of TFTD, it could not be touched. <br /><br />The battle to get humanists on the strand has been going on for decades. It has become a symbolic issue, given TFTD&rsquo;s prominent position on the nation&rsquo;s flagship morning news programme. And there is an untold side to this history. While researching the private diaries and letters of the late Christian activist Mary Whitehouse, I uncovered evidence of her efforts and strategic role in allying establishment forces &ndash; including, it seems, the Queen &ndash; in keeping humanists off the strand. In exploring the roots of Whitehouse&rsquo;s hostility to the movement in the 1960s and 70s, there are valuable lessons to be learned for our own culture wars today.<br /><br />It is 20 years since Whitehouse died, at 91 years of age. Often compared to the American conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, she fought many battles over four decades of campaigning for &ldquo;decency&rdquo;. Whitehouse came to prominence in the 1960s as Britain was being transformed through the youth-focused energy of pop music, film and television. Churchgoing was in significant decline and new immigrant communities were widening the range of religious beliefs.<br /><br />One of her earliest campaigns, in 1964, was to &ldquo;clean up TV&rdquo;, with a particular focus on the BBC. In 1965, she founded the grassroots National Viewers&rsquo; and Listeners&rsquo; Association which, even when its membership numbered tens of thousands, was never more than a platform for her personal lobbying power. <br /><br />In her early career, Whitehouse was an evangelical outsider challenging the complacency of the established Churches. By the 1980s she was very well connected with those in power. But to my surprise, it&rsquo;s in 1994, in her final years, that she fought one of her least known, but perhaps most successful, battles: to keep humanists off &ldquo;Thought for the Day&rdquo;.</p> <h2>The decline of Christian identity in Britain</h2> <p>In July 1994 Mary Whitehouse had finally retired from public life, frail and suffering considerable pain from a back injury. The Conservative government was increasingly blighted by &ldquo;sleaze&rdquo; allegations over MPs&rsquo; sexual behaviour and financial wrongdoing. That same month the Sunday Trading Act came into force, allowing shops to open on the Christian Sabbath. <br /><br />It seemed like a watershed moment in the decline of Christian identity in British life. Perhaps it was no coincidence, then, that in December that year Whitehouse spotted a <em>Sunday Times</em> article claiming John Birt, BBC director general since 1992, had approved humanists being included in TFTD from the following year.<br /><br />&ldquo;Apparently the decision will be made in the next week or two!&rdquo; she wrote in her diary on Christmas morning. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve done nothing about it! We fought this battle in the early days of our campaign. And here we are &ndash; back again. Think I should write to the Queen. Dukie [Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC Chairman and by now a personal friend] to the Cardinal and leaders of the free churches.&rdquo;<br /><br />In January 1995 she did just that. The draft of the letter, dated 5 January, begins:<br /><br />&ldquo;Your Majesty,<br /><br />"I write with the greatest respect in the hope that you will feel able to help in a matter which we believe to be of the greatest importance.<br /><br />"We understand that the British Humanist Association, which has long been campaigning for access to Thought For The Day, the highly influential section of the BBC&rsquo;s breakfast broadcasting, may soon be granted such facilities in an imminent re-organisation of religious broadcasting.<br /><br />"It would be wholly inappropriate for me to point out to Your Majesty, of all people, the importance of the Christian faith in our history and culture and what would be lost in the quality of personal and national Iife were it to become merely an alternative to humanism. <br /><br />"If you do see your way clear to taking any initiative in this matter then surely the nation&rsquo;s gratitude would be very great.&rdquo;<br /><br />Whitehouse&rsquo;s diary entry for 14 January suggests good news: &ldquo;Really delighted to have a letter from Buckingham Palace in reply to mine to the Queen about the proposal that the British Humanist Association&rsquo;s (BHA) demand for time on Thought For The Day. Although not &ndash; as we all understand &ndash; written by the Queen herself it was a very reassuring letter. I would be very surprised if doesn&rsquo;t do something.&rdquo; The Bodleian has redacted the palace reply.<br /><br />Just over a week later, Whitehouse wrote identical letters to George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Cardinal Basil Hume, Archbishop of Westminster:<br /><br />&ldquo;I am taking the liberty of writing to ask if you will consider making a public stand against what could be a most disastrous move, not only in terms of the spiritual health of the nation, but also of its social wellbeing.&rdquo; Adding that she had already written to the BBC Chairman, she continues, &ldquo;I trust you will agree that this is a matter of the utmost importance and that you will see your way clear to employing your considerable influence in support of the Christian heritage of the nation.&rdquo;<br /><br />A reply dated 27 January came from Archbishop George Carey at Lambeth Palace:<br /><br />&ldquo;I have certainly made my views clear on this to Ernest Rea [the BBC&rsquo;s head of Religion and Ethics] but I can assure you that I will exert my influence against this proposal.&rdquo; He went on to warn Whitehouse against overreacting to the <em>Sunday Times</em> article, which &ldquo;could bring about the result that neither of us wants!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s signed: &ldquo;Yours ever, George.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Resisting humanism on the BBC</h2> <p>What happened in the intervening months? Mary was out of the loop. But her diary on 14 April records that the wheels she had perhaps set in motion appeared to be nearing their endpoint. <br /><br />&ldquo;Delighted to see in today&rsquo;s <em>Telegraph</em> that the BBC is to keep its TFTD as Christian, resisting the efforts of the humanists to infiltrate and no doubt come to dominate! We made our voice heard about that! Wonder, if not for the first time, if the fact that I have &lsquo;retired&rsquo; and not likely to be associated directly with what happens, makes TV big boys more likely to &lsquo;deal with problems&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br /><br />The remark about &ldquo;TV big boys&rdquo; seems fair, given the way she had been routinely mocked and treated with disdain as a lower-middle-class, provincial older woman. However, Andrew Copson, current chief executive of Humanists UK (formerly the BHA), is less sympathetic:<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really weird that she sees humanists as being like a conspiracy and organising and lobbying,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one doing that, not the BHA in a secret shady cabal. It&rsquo;s her! I don&rsquo;t know how influential Mary Whitehouse was in this battle but I do think that for all her rhetoric about being like a gadfly and a challenger . . . she&rsquo;s the one with the powerful friends.<br /><br />&ldquo;Humanism has in my knowledge got as far as three director generals agreeing with our point . . . that for the dignity of our listeners and for the fairness of our public broadcaster, humanist views should be included. Face-to-face in all three cases. And just a couple of weeks later for the invisible brick wall to appear. So it obviously is a totemic issue.&rdquo;<br /><br />John Birt, now Lord Birt, recalls the power of the religious leaders who sat on the UK broadcasters&rsquo; Central Religious Advisory Committee (CRAC): &ldquo;In very general terms I do remember being sympathetic to allowing humanist voices onto TFTD,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;And again in general terms I was always struck by the power of CRAC, which operated across all of broadcasting, and how fiercely it defended the position of the established religions within broadcasting. And the political reality was that the [BBC] Board of Governors was unlikely to support anything CRAC strongly opposed.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was only in 2009 that CRAC was replaced by a new body, the Standing Conference on Religion and Belief, which does include humanists.</p> <h2>Undermining the west and its Christian stability</h2> <p>As Copson observes: &ldquo;The growing humanism of the British population was everything [Whitehouse] was against . . . because it stood and it stands for freedom of choice, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, equal treatment, no religious privilege.&rdquo;<br /><br />But Whitehouse didn&rsquo;t see humanists like that. To understand her deep loathing of humanism it&rsquo;s essential to appreciate how deeply she linked it with communism, liberalising pornography and lowering the age of sexual consent as weapons to undermine the west and its Christian stability. This perception stemmed back at least to the early 70s, and a bitter culture war in the UK over shifting boundaries on decency, sexual consent and pornography, which was often fought on the airwaves as well as in the national press. Humanists were prominent in leading the national conversation.<br /><br />At the time, humanism was being increasingly normalised in British society. The BHA was lobbying for state school education to reflect the growth in non-religious philosophies and traditions. A number of humanists were making influential, challenging television for the BBC, including the young producer David Kennard, who was the first to bring on atheists to challenge Christian leaders on <em>The Sunday Debate</em>, a high-profile television slot which ran from 1973 to 75. Kennard went on to work on landmarks of cultural broadcasting with two of the late 20th century&rsquo;s best-known humanist thinkers, Professor Jacob Bronowski and Carl Sagan. The former&rsquo;s <em>The Ascent of Man</em> challenged the narrow Judaeo-Christian view of &ldquo;civilisation&rdquo;, while Sagan&rsquo;s astronomy series, <em>Cosmos</em>, placed humans in a beautiful but godless universe. <br /><br />But Whitehouse&rsquo;s moral outrage found particular traction on one controversial issue that the British Humanist Association got engaged with. This was the campaign to lower the age of sexual consent to 14, or even 10. Pushed by the Paedophile Information Exchange, it was backed by the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL &ndash; now Liberty). <br /><br />On 3 June 1976, she published an article in the <em>Times</em> about her opposition to a report that recommended liberalising the teaching of religion and ethics in schools. The article references the campaign to lower the age of sexual consent and links the BHA to the NCCL as part of a permissive cabal:<br /><br />&ldquo;The BHA has little in common with historical humanism, which sought to discover man&rsquo;s role in relation to God. Rather its natural allies are bodies like the National Council for Civil Liberties and indeed, at its annual meeting the association&rsquo;s general secretary, Kenneth Furness, will propose a motion welcoming and supporting the recent NCCL recommendations &lsquo;that the age of consent should be lowered to 14 for both heterosexuals and homosexuals and that incest be made legal&rsquo;. No wonder they feel that young people educated in the Christian faith are likely to present a problem.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was Whitehouse and her supporters whose campaigning exposed how the Paedophile Information Exchange was jumping on the sexual liberation bandwagon, aided by the NCCL. <br /><br />A few days later she wrote in the <em>Guardian</em> about her concerns at comments by the head of the British Board of Film Censors, John Trevelyan, on the impact of liberalising laws around film censorship and pornography:</p> <p>&ldquo;The apparent enthusiasm of the permissible lobby in its advocacy of an end to the age of consent shows a lack of compassion which is truly frightening. There should be no conviction says Trevelyan, &lsquo;if consent can be proved or shown to have been probable&rsquo; &ndash; think what kind of pressure might be exerted here. &lsquo;There can be no standard rate of maturity in young people.&rsquo; Quite so. So who, may I ask, is going to decide a girl&rsquo;s maturity? Are we now to set up, on the National Health, a series of Lolita Clinics which will provide a girl/boy child, after suitable investigation, with a little badge carrying the inscription &lsquo;certified mature &ndash; Try me.&rsquo; Certified insane, if you ask me.&rdquo;<br /><br />Furness himself chose to mock Whitehouse in the <em>Guardian</em> letters page using his BHA title: <br /><br />&ldquo;Mary Whitehouse displays a deep and detailed knowledge of pornographic material of all kinds. Unlike most of us, she is not apparently bored by this material. Is she however corrupted by it? And if not, why not? Yours faithfully Kenneth Furness Gen Sec BHA.&rdquo;</p> <h2>The fight against conservative forces</h2> <p>Reading the sneering way some humanists responded to Whitehouse&rsquo;s concerns about sexual exploitation of women and children made me think of the feminist Andrea Dworkin&rsquo;s astute observation in her 1982 book <em>Right-Wing Women</em>: &ldquo;Right-wing women are sure that the selective blindness of liberals and leftists especially contributes to more violence, more humiliation, more exploitation for women, often in the name of humanism and freedom (which is why both words are dirty words to them).&rdquo; <br /><br />As Copson says: &ldquo;A lot of humanists were involved in some really quite distasteful legal cases. [Barrister and author] John Mortimer was an active humanist and a member of the BHA&rsquo;s advisory council. And he was defending all sorts of distasteful people [pornographers] on freedom of speech grounds.&rdquo;<br /><br />In a witness statement in 2020 to the British government&rsquo;s ongoing independent inquiry into historic child sexual abuse, Liberty&rsquo;s then acting director, Corey Stoughton, reaffirmed the organisation&rsquo;s apologies and regret over its &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; in supporting the Paedophile Information Exchange. He quoted the charity&rsquo;s former director, Shami Chakrabarti, who said in 2014: &ldquo;It is a source of continuing disgust and horror&rdquo; that the NCCL had been infiltrated by paedophiles in the 1970s. Stoughton added that such failures would not and could not be repeated. <br /><br />We can only hope that they won&rsquo;t be. However, the story may still hold valuable lessons for us today. According to Copson, while Whitehouse lost her long-term war, she was successful in the short term in pushing back against the influence of humanism in British society at large for a good decade in the 70s and 80s. She was able to do so by emphasising the controversial issues being championed at the time by a few high-profile figures.<br /><br />As the left today finds itself caught up in bitter culture wars, there is perhaps a warning from Mary Whitehouse&rsquo;s establishment-backed war on humanism: battles must be picked carefully, for fear of losing a decade or more to conservative forces.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Some critics may claim that talent is the only determinant of whether a writer makes it onto the published page, although the emerging female and queer voices &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; from previous centuries and published to popular and critical acclaim show this cannot be true.<br /><br />I think we should have that in mind while reading Juliet Jacques, whose voice and experience &ndash; as well as the voices and experiences of the characters in her latest book, <em>Variations</em> &ndash; have been brought into view in part thanks to the profound cultural change happening right now. Jacques&rsquo; idiosyncratic, campy voice, her tendency to draw on seemingly disparate interests in cultures considered both &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; (from avant-garde art to football), combined with her perspective as a trans woman, make for a very rare quality. I have been an avid reader of Jacques for some years, from when she first raised LGBTQ+ issues as a journalist and told her own history of transitioning in the <em>Guardian</em>, to her remarkable <em>Trans: A Memoir</em>. Appearing in 2015, the book displayed her characteristic combination of dry, self-deprecating humour and stunning erudition, but also her surprising tenderness in depicting her family&rsquo;s reactions and her social surroundings.<br /><br /><em>Variations</em> is the most mature and ambitious Jacques work to date. It&rsquo;s conceived as a series of fictionalised stories, each told in a different literary form: a film script, an epistolary novel, a found diary, even a medical report. In each, a fictional character gives voice to a different side of the reality of queer life in Britain. It is, in its own way, her version of <em>Small Lives</em> by Pierre Michon, which told the stories of various characters from his family&rsquo;s ancient history and of the peripheral figures from his hometown whose lives would have usually been considered too insignificant for literature &ndash; a servant, a hobo, a peasant priest.<br /><br />In Jacques&rsquo; version, it&rsquo;s a combination of class and marginalisation based on sexual orientation. &ldquo;A Wo/Man of No Importance&rdquo;, the story of Arthur Parr, fictitious contemporary of Oscar Wilde, is a pretext for a highly camp journey into Wilde&rsquo;s trial against the Marquess of Queensberry, his fight for the respect of his queer contemporaries, and the right to live a life without labels. My favourite is &ldquo;Standards of Care&rdquo;, the fictionalised diary of a transgender woman called Sandy, living in Manchester, whose backstory is glam rock fandom and the development of punk culture around 1977.</p> <h2>Queer socialist utopia</h2> <p>Glam was an obvious refuge for queers, who could experiment with drag, crossdressing and identity without being necessarily spat at on the street (which happens to many of the other characters). Sandy frequents a clinic in London to be assessed for gender correction surgery. There she meets Elena and other transgender women whose devotion to music and bravery in self-expression unite them.<br /><br />Culture, along with makeup and clothes, plays just as important a role in these stories as radical politics. The queerness of the characters is never their most important attribute and the period details are rigorously researched. &ldquo;Exhibition&rdquo;, for instance, is an epistolary story set in 1939 Blackpool, where the woman-born, man-identifying protagonist spends two months in the House of Curiosities by the seaside promenade. There, he performs a reality-TV-like show, watched from behind a glass &ndash; as a desperate ploy to make money, but also as an attempt to finally live as who he feels he is, in the face of the very society denying him his identity. <br /><br /><em>Variations</em> must be the only book in the world to mention the mid-century social research project &ldquo;Mass Observation&rdquo; in the same breath as the 1970s glam rock inventors and eager crossdressers, the New York Dolls, along with countless other snippets of life and culture, a large canvas on which the pattern for a utopian socialist queer life might be inscribed. This is a touching, delightful collection from a vital voice, making you want to struggle for a different world.</p> <p><em>This piece is from New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>

We went to see David Copperfieldâs amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfieldâs shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homerâs stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box. Â There is a Â need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with Â Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide Â£2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actuallyÂ <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This websiteÂ <em>isÂ </em>calledÂ <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here.Â <strong>Zero-hourÂ </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered.Â <strong>Zero-timeÂ </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would beÂ <em>teachingÂ </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertakeÂ <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;tÂ <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a>Â on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in oneâs area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesnât capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>Â· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>Â· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasnât yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouragingÂ <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are alreadyÂ <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages butÂ <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage,Â <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
