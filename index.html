            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/NewHumanistCash.jpg" height="1406" alt="Illustration by Martin Rowson, 'Sorry, card only'" width="1592" /></p> <p>When I was a boy growing up in South Africa, I would go to a church where the preacher would passionately lecture us about a benevolent God who wanted everyone to come into his fold. The only condition was that you had to bow down to him. Failure to do so would result in doom.<br /><br />Christianity, as I experienced it, presented a utopia and a dystopia &ndash; heaven and hell &ndash; and assumed you wanted to get to the former. The priest showcased two groups who were at risk of not making the cut. The first was bad people, who knew about God but refused to follow him. The second was ignorant people, who didn&rsquo;t yet know about God. Those were the ones missionaries were supposed to rescue.<br /><br />Around this time, the book series<em> Left Behind</em> came out (later turned into a Nicolas Cage film). It was a fictionalised account of &ldquo;the Rapture&rdquo;, a belief (originating from evangelical American Christianity) that God would one day teleport all true believers up into heaven at once, leaving sinners to fend for themselves in the hellish days of the Antichrist. Christians had a visceral fear of missing this ride to utopia, and I remember the fearful confusion I faced when thinking about my atheist uncle. I saw him as a good person, but he didn&rsquo;t follow God, despite knowing about him. I was terrified that he would be left behind.<br /><br />Three decades later, my uncle still has no interest in being included in the Rapture, but neither do I anymore. In retrospect, my early experiences with evangelical Christianity have left me with an ability to see how an eerily similar formula is used to promote digital corporate expansion today. And much like the missionaries who express incredulity that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to go to heaven, these firms think it&rsquo;s outrageous that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to ascend to &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; &ndash; their world of hyper-connected and hyper-global digital markets that are supposed to free us from &ldquo;inconvenience&rdquo; and &ldquo;friction&rdquo;, by which they mean all that physical interaction between people on the ground.</p> <h2>Surveillance capitalism</h2> <p>The term &ldquo;surveillance capitalism&rdquo; was first popularised by Shoshana Zuboff&rsquo;s 2018 book <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em>. It refers to the now widespread business model of digital corporations that seek to profit by gathering our personal data. The parallels between surveillance capitalism and the spread of monotheistic religion are striking. Consider the fact that tech giants like Amazon seek to extend themselves across the Earth, aiming for the same app to appear before you wherever you are. It&rsquo;s not dissimilar to those crusaders who sought to spread uniform monotheistic religions across borders, barging out smaller and more diverse &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; systems, refocusing spirituality on a singular sky god. <br /><br />Once a sky god has taken over, there&rsquo;s no need to consult a directory of minor deities to see who you have to appeal to in order to get a river to flow again, or for your business to succeed, or for your tribe to win a war. There&rsquo;s only one divinity, who intermediates between everything from above. No act is a private act &ndash; it is watched and judged &ndash; and all &ldquo;correct&rdquo; acts route through the god (which contributes to a pervasive feeling of guilt, as your desires are scanned by an all-seeing eye).<br /><br />How does this relate to corporate surveillance capitalism? Well, collectively, we can see that major tech firms are establishing themselves as an interconnected cartel of sky gods that hover over us, watching us and getting us to route all our interactions with each other through them. Indeed, Facebook and others are even positioning themselves to create a &ldquo;metaverse&rdquo;, a virtual reality realm where you can leave the physical world of your body and live life as an avatar in their data centres (see <a href="/articles/5942/meet-me-in-the-metaverse">Jay Owens&rsquo; feature</a> in the <em>New Humanist </em>spring 2022 issue).</p> <h2>Ascending to "the cloud"</h2> <p>It&rsquo;s always risky to extend a metaphor, but we could see firms like Facebook, Amazon and Google as promoting a corporate &ldquo;Rapture&rdquo;: a future in which we all get absorbed into their systems via our various devices and smartphones. Don&rsquo;t get left behind!<br /><br />Before this can happen, however, a key transition needs to take place: the abolition of cash. Tech firms cannot fully lock you into dependence on their data centres unless physical cash is pulled away from us. The ongoing use of cash hinders the consolidation and expansion of the digital corporate sector, because cash is offline and fundamentally incompatible with the promotion of online life. <br /><br />To spread seamlessly across the Earth, tech firms need to automate payments for their services, but this requires them to enter into partnerships with digital payments and fintech firms who plug into the digital money infrastructure run by the banking system.<br /><br />At this point it is crucial to note that modern monetary systems are only partially run by state institutions. While it is true that central banks issue physical cash, it is commercial banks that issue the digital money that we use when tapping our contactless cards. If the central bank is an old financial sky god, these banks are somewhat like a ring of powerful angels that surround it, slowly usurping its power by getting us to convert to their digital money. Indeed, Bank of America&rsquo;s CEO openly stated in 2019 that &ldquo;we want a cashless society&rdquo;, and that they have &ldquo;more to gain than anybody&rdquo; from the decline of cash.<br /><br />In my new book &ndash; <em>Cloudmoney</em> &ndash; I trace how financial firms have engaged in a &ldquo;war on cash&rdquo; for at least the last three decades, sowing moral panic about it by casting it as a favourite of criminals and tax dodgers. During the pandemic, this war was accelerated, with digital finance players only too happy to take advantage of the heightened fear of physical interaction. With almost no scientific evidence of the actual risk of disease transmission, many retailers began urging shoppers to switch to digital payments as a safer option, despite the fact that pre-eminent health research bodies like Germany&rsquo;s Robert Koch Institute insisted that &ldquo;cash poses no particular risk of infection for the public&rdquo;.</p> <h2>The promotion of a cashless society</h2> <p>Digital bank money &ndash; and all the apps and cards that depend upon it &ndash; is now presented as a safer and more efficient &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to the monetary system, but really what is happening is a restructuring of power, away from the state and towards the banking sector. Central banks now find themselves caught between a legacy commitment to provide public money in the form of cash, and a commitment to serve their private commercial banking partners, who compete against cash.<br /><br />This is why central banks only make half-hearted attempts to protect the cash system, and why, during the early days of the pandemic, the Bank of England stood silent while misinformation about cash being a Covid transmitter was spread. Major retailers like Tesco, for example, would loudly request that their customers use cards instead of cash, citing safety concerns, but it was only after several months of this that the Bank of England finally took a meek stand: they released a quiet research report in their November 2020 Quarterly Bulletin, showing that cash was far safer than card terminals, goods on open shelves, trolley handles and the digital touch screens of self-service checkouts found at supermarkets.<br /><br />But let&rsquo;s face it. The reason the digital financial sector promotes digital payment is not for your personal safety. It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s profitable. Digital payment routes through banking and payment company data centres, leaving a long trail of data of when, where and with whom you interact. That data can be used to decide whether to punish you or not (are you doing something bad?), to give you access or not (are you worthy of receiving a particular service?) and also to promote things to you (are you the kind of person who will respond to our prompts?).<br /><br />This commercial agenda in turn empowers new political agendas. In religions, a sky god can watch you and store up judgement for later, but not stop you in the moment. Corporate capitalism, by contrast, is building systems that enable the act of watching to be enlisted into the act of stopping. Once you are dependent on digital payments, they form an extremely effective vector via which states and companies can influence and restrict certain actions. The geopolitical element of this is well-known &ndash; for example, Russian citizens have had their ability to transact across borders severely curtailed as Russian banks are ejected from the SWIFT international payments network. But the ability to prevent the authorisation of payments for goods or services which an authority deems undesirable is beginning to be seen within countries too. The trend can be viewed everywhere from Australia &ndash; with its controversial &ldquo;cashless welfare card&rdquo; that regulates what a welfare recipient can buy (and from where) &ndash; to China, with its nascent Social Credit System: a nationwide system for collating multiple sources of data about individuals into scores that can trigger restrictions on certain goods or services.</p> <p>The promotion of a &ldquo;cashless society&rdquo;, then, is ideological, with cash cast as a fallen angel &ndash; a sinful and backward form of payment used by dirty people to pick up dirty goods from street-side markets while leaving no data trail. You&rsquo;re supposed to desire seamless digital efficiency, not that hell of the cash economy. According to the ideology of digital innovation, there are &ndash; apparently &ndash; only two groups at risk of being &ldquo;left behind&rdquo; in that hell. Bad people &ndash; criminals &ndash; who wish to remain in the darkness of physical cash, and ignorant people, who haven&rsquo;t yet realised that they desire digital payments and fintech apps (or who struggle to adopt them). The former should be arrested, while the latter need to be on-boarded into financial surveillance capitalism by its missionaries.</p> <h2>Silicon Valley and the "Singularity"</h2> <p>For those who feel I&rsquo;m exaggerating the religious metaphor, it is worth introducing the concept of the technological &ldquo;Singularity&rdquo;. This is the idea that, at some hypothetical time in the future, technological growth will become self-perpetuating, irreversible and all-encompassing, culminating in a &ldquo;point of no return&rdquo; at which we get absorbed into a vast intermeshed &ldquo;super-intelligence&rdquo;. <br /><br />The concept is promoted by Google&rsquo;s director of engineering, Ray Kurweil, who has written books on the topic &ndash; such as <em>The Age of Spiritual Machines</em> &ndash; and who co-founded the Singularity University in Silicon Valley, along with space entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, to solve all earthly problems through technology. <br /><br />I have taught as a guest lecturer at the Singularity University, and have witnessed first-hand the almost evangelical belief that &ldquo;Singularitarians&rdquo;, as they call themselves, have in the power of digital tech to allow humans to not only &ldquo;transcend&rdquo; all problems, but to transcend their very bodies (immortality research is an old favourite of transhumanists, who tend to hover around the Singularity scene).<br /><br />Within religious teleologies, it is often imagined that history unfolds towards a final reckoning &ndash; like the Rapture &ndash; in which a single order will emerge. The Singularity vision is not so different. In her essay &ldquo;God in the machine&rdquo;, former Christian evangelist Meghan O&rsquo;Gieblyn argues that belief in the Singularity mirrors biblical salvation stories almost exactly. The only difference is that heaven is replaced with a transnational agglomeration of corporate data centres. Not everyone in Silicon Valley buys into the Singularity vision, but milder versions of the &ldquo;transcendence-through-technology&rdquo; belief are endemic to tech culture.<br /><br />Really, though, this belief is inherent within the ideology of modern capitalism more generally. It is common to speak of the economy as &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; becoming ever more technologically complex and interconnected as it expands, and for this tendency to be cloaked in cliched phrases, such as that we are living in &ldquo;a rapidly changing world&rdquo;. The global economy appears to us as a vast procession moving inevitably towards ever greater growth, and against this backdrop we are constantly asked to catch up or adapt.</p> <h2>The benefits of a syncretic economy</h2> <p>To understand why this ideology is so problematic, consider the following. Much as we maintain transport systems that keep multiple options open &ndash; roads for cars, lanes for bicycles, and tracks for trains &ndash; we should be aiming for payment systems that do the same. If the transport system was left to the car industry, it would vote to remove bicycle lanes in order to help accelerate a &ldquo;bicycle-less society&rdquo;, whilst lobbying government to subsidise the purchase of cars under the guise of &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo;. Similarly, it&rsquo;s the finance and tech industry that spends so much time trying to convince us that moving over completely to digital payments would be in all our interests, and that everyone must be saved from cash at all costs. <br /><br />Religious systems that maintain multiple deities, and the ability to switch between them, are often called &ldquo;syncretic&rdquo;. A syncretic religion is a hybrid religion, where &ndash; for example &ndash; animist spirits are consulted alongside a Christian sky god. This is found extensively in my home country of South Africa, where European economic colonialism often followed in the same tracks as missionaries, creating zones of both economic and religious mixing, or &ldquo;syncretism&rdquo;. <br /><br />Just as a syncretic religion can mix river gods with angels living in the clouds, we can think of a &ldquo;syncretic economy&rdquo; as one in which traditional informal economic practices continue alongside transnational corporate ones. I extend this ethos to payments systems. I believe in defending a syncretic system, with cash-based street trade being allowed to operate alongside digital payments.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s normally at this point that somebody asks me, &ldquo;But what about Bitcoin?&rdquo; Cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum are somewhat like limited-edition digital medallions, their movements tracked on a decentralised network. Bitcoin promoters specialise in encouraging hundreds of millions of people to buy these cyber-collectibles, a process that makes early adopters very wealthy in dollars. They were initially presented as being a challenge to the existing monetary system, but the vast majority of people who hold such crypto-tokens view them as speculative objects priced in money, rather than being money themselves.<br /><br />That said, tokens like Bitcoin are accelerating a practice called countertrade, which is the process of using non-monetary objects for exchange, via their monetary prices (much as I can swap a rare antique medallion with a monetary price for something of equivalent price). Crypto countertrade is certainly adding some interesting new textures to the monetary system, but a far more effective way to resist corporate surveillance capitalism is simply to protect the use of cash. <br /><br />In continuing to use the notes and coins in your wallet, you are not some laggard who&rsquo;s behind the curve. You are someone who refuses to accept the myth that progress lies in ever larger systems presided over by small groups of mega-firms. Humans are slow physical creatures, and we should be allowed to use slow physical money. So the next time a fintech company tells you to &ldquo;upgrade your life&rdquo;, or a yuppie shop informs you that they no longer accept cash, you&rsquo;re perfectly entitled to tell them to go to hell.</p> <div class="col-9"> <div class="mceContentBody mt-3"> <p class="p6"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">This is rather interesting: an <a href="https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Collections-Research/Registration-Department/Registration-Blog/The-Widows-Arrival">article from the National Museum of Ireland</a> describing the appearance of the noble false widow (<i>Steatoda nobilis</i>) in that country, in the late 1990s. I haven&#8217;t seen any of that specific species in my neighborhood, but apparently they are a significantly invasive species. We have lots of <i>Steatoda</i> and <i>Parasteatoda</i> here, though!</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of us in Ireland have heard about this recent arrival, but few would know its scientific name, <i>Steatoda nobilis</i>. This spider is more commonly known as the noble false widow.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in an article published at the time (Nolan 1999), Myles Nolan tells the reader that a couple of weeks prior to the aforementioned Bray discovery, another person had found a great number of these spiders on their own property, approximately 250m away from the Bray residence. The author observed at the time that these spiders have a high reproductive rate, and that the spiderlings are inclined to disperse widely from the egg sac, perhaps accounting for this species&#8217; ability to colonise easily.</p>
<p>The Museum specimen detailed in our acquisition register is, however, the first valid Irish record as an identified specimen was lodged with the Museum. That specimen (called a ‘voucher specimen’) is now stored safely in the Museum and is available for study and research.</p>
<p>As Ireland currently houses relatively few animals who pose a risk to human health, this new arachnid is now of great curiosity to the public. The reports, however, are over emphasised, and there is little for humans to fear from the noble false widow.</p>
<p>A recent report from the Irish scientific community however, showed that a common lizard had been preyed upon by this diminutive spider (Dunbar et al. 2018). The young lizard was discovered wrapped in spider webbing, with the noble false widow crouched over its head, presumed to have been feeding on it – a potential worry for Ireland’s only native terrestrial reptile.<br />
The noble false widow can now be found in at least 17 Irish counties, all year round, both indoors and out (although more so the latter). They have a strong tendency to live on manmade structures and materials, such as steel, concrete and timber. Sheds, outhouses and boundary railings provide the perfect habitat for our new arrival.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of the reason for the relatively sudden appearance of <i>Steatoda nobilis</i> in the scientific eye, though, is the British tabloids, which had an absolute freakout over big spiders, playing up the nearly non-existent dangers and clutching their pearls over the observation of a few spiders near one of the Queen&#8217;s estates. It was ridiculous.</p>

The sudden massive increase in records seen in the last decade coincides with the first appearance<br />of the species in various other countries far from the native range in the Macaronesian islands.</p></div>
<p>I can vouch for <i>Steatoda</i>&#8216;s eagerness to disperse &#8212; when I found the newly emerged clutch of spiderlings yesterday evening, they had nicely spread out equidistant from each other in their container, and when I opened it up, the race was on, with all the spiderlings on the edge of the mass rushing to get out into the larger lab. I think they don&#8217;t much care for their brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>The &#8220;high reproductive rate&#8221;, though, is a relative thing. My impression of <i>Steatoda triangulosa</i> and <i>Steatoda borealis</i>, the local species in the genus, is that they were sluggards compared to <i>Parasteatoda</i>. They take a month to develop from egg to spiderling, compared to <i>Parasteatoda</i>&#8216;s week and a half, and they have much smaller clutch sizes than <i>Parasteatoda</i>. I&#8217;ve been sitting here feeling like the <i>Steatoda</i>s take forever to get to the point I can work with them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at the end of that month I am finding myself drowning in baby spiders…</p>

<p>I am reminded that little kids are exhausting. We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend with an energetic 3 year old, but it was necessary to get home to recover. Except…yikes, things are heating up in the lab.</p>
<p>I had one egg sac open up 12 days ago, and another this weekend. A third is imminent &#8212; I dread going into the lab today to see even more spiderlings. Then there are two more that will open up in a week. I got home last night and had to sort out and move a cloud of adorable baby spiders into separate containers. I&#8217;ve got two small incubators in my lab, and they&#8217;ll be full today; I&#8217;m running out of the small plastic containers I keep the small ones in. Then I&#8217;ve got a <i>Parasteatoda</i> egg sac that is threatening to hatch out any day now.</p>
<p>I am beginning to realize it may be possible to have too many spiders.</p>

You can see them on their live stream (this is a continuous stream, and you could start watching right now for six hours before you&#8217;ll see the expected stunning images).</p>

<p>Now I don&#8217;t know what to call the Giant Space Widget. It&#8217;s been <em>officially</em> named after an administrator and homophobe, rather than a scientist, and I&#8217;d rather not use that name at all. To see why, maybe you could fill some of the time you&#8217;re waiting by watching this video:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the images, but I&#8217;m going to have to refer to it as the [PLACEHOLDER] Space Telescope, unless someone has a better name. Why is it named after a  homophobic bureaucrat anyway?</p>

These are changes to the very earth and sea around us, on the largest scale imaginable.</p> <p class="p3">The culprit is the dramatic rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and the remedy currently being applied is a move to renewable energy. Oil and gas are being replaced with solar, wind, nuclear and other carbon-free sources. But society today is not only dependent on energy. We also rely on an industrial carbon economy &ndash; one that produces everything from carbon-based plastics to fibres and detergents. And it is not only the energy for this industry that comes from fossil fuels, but the carbon itself.</p> <p class="p3">Thankfully, tiny helpers are at hand. Humans are finally learning from the original carbon cycle, which has governed Earth for 4 billion years. This natural cycle is regulated largely by bacteria and other microbes. Today, using what we know about the chemical wizardry of bacteria, scientists are developing processes to create carbon products from CO2, rather than from oil or gas.</p> <p class="p3">Alongside the transition to renewable energy, the building of a new carbon economy could play a vital role in helping us reach net zero.</p> <h2 class="p4">The wonders of bacteria</h2> <p class="p5">Let&rsquo;s see how it works in more detail. Life has existed on Earth for around 4 billion years; for over 3 billion of them in the form of single-celled organisms. The machinery of life that now exists in every living creature evolved first in bacteria, whose crucial innovation was the light-harvesting process of photosynthesis, which enables biomass to be created from water, sunlight and carbon dioxide in the air. Oxygen, a by-product of that process, eventually built up in the oceans and the atmosphere, supporting multicellular, higher animal life: this was the road from single-celled organisms to us.</p> <p class="p3">Incredible as it now seems, it wasn&rsquo;t until the 1860s that humankind discovered the existence of bacteria. Even then, these microbes were misunderstood, being taken simply as a cause of disease. But during the 20th century it became apparent that bacteria are the basis of all life. Only microbes (a catch-all term that includes bacteria and fungi) can recycle the remains of living things when they die. In the oceans, they still produce roughly half of the oxygen in the air. They trap the nitrogen in the atmosphere and turn it into useful ammonia and nitrates which feed our plant life.</p> <p class="p3">This natural ecosystem created great deposits of iron oxide, chalk from the compacted shells of decayed marine organisms, coal from decayed trees and other plants, and oil and gas from marine microbes that sank to the bottom of the ocean and were transformed by the pressure of sediments. Eventually, around 250 years ago, humans began to use these materials, laid down by early life, to develop industrial civilisation. In this period &ndash; just a quarter of a millennium &ndash; humans have burnt millions of years&rsquo; worth of fossil fuels, riding roughshod over the planet&rsquo;s own geochemical and geophysical processes. The results, as we know, have taken us to the edge of climate catastrophe.</p> <p class="p5">Today, however, we are finally learning from the world of microbes. Bacteria, we are discovering, possess all of the ingenious chemistry to enable the synthesis of every organic substance we need to sustain human civilisation. With the help of bacteria, companies are now producing fuel from industrial waste gases which would otherwise further pollute our atmosphere.</p> <p class="p3">And while this source of carbon dioxide is still reliant on the burning of oil and gas, we can also capture CO2 directly from the air. Prohibitively expensive at present, work is ongoing to make direct air capture economically viable.</p> <p class="p3">We would then be able to produce a range of chemicals needed to make plastics, fibres or even food without the need to release any further CO2. Even better, the new carbon economy could help reduce the dangerous levels already in the atmosphere. This new and virtuous industrial carbon cycle could help rectify the harm done by the old, polluting one.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Building the new carbon economy</span></h2> <p class="p3">There is much work to do. The physical damage done by the burning of fossil fuels began in earnest around the late 18th century. But the seeds were sown much earlier when, around 6,000 years after the domestication of crops and animals had become the norm, humans told themselves the story that their dominion over nature had been granted to them by God.</p> <p class="p3">Since then, exercising our &ldquo;dominion&rdquo;, we have made the world comfortable for ourselves through a life-support system of food, energy, transport, shelter and communications by grossly coralling nature for our own ends.</p> <p class="p3">Yet, as the iconoclastic biologist Lynn Margulis pointed out in her 1986 book <em>Microcosmos: Four Billion Years of Microbial Evolution</em> (co-written with Dorion Sagan), the machinery of life is the same in bacteria or a redwood tree or a human being. We are all bacterial assemblages. Nature only knows the trading of gases between organisms and the air, the waters and the Earth. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the outward form is:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p6">&ldquo;Life at the surface of the Earth seems to regulate itself in the face of external perturbation, and does so without regard for the individuals and species that compose it . . . The visible world is a late-arriving, overgrown portion of the microcosm, and it functions only because of its well-developed connection with the microcosm&rsquo;s activities.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p5">So what is the connection between the microcosm and the macro environment?It can be summed up as a three-way molecular dance between carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (with a little help from a few other key elements &ndash; nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, etc). Carbon is either in a hydrogenated state, known chemically as &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; (that is all the biomass including us), or in an oxidised state as CO2. The astrobiologist Michael Russell has summed up the secret of life in one line: &ldquo;The purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">That is nature&rsquo;s carbon cycle, which has existed for around 4 billion years. Our own industrial fossil-based carbon cycle actually began with farming 10,000 years ago. Farming disrupts the natural ecosystem to produce our food in ways that are now deeply damaging, given the scale our population demands. It then went on to power the modern industrial economy with a vast range of manufactured materials, both mineral and organically carbon based: metals, plastics, ceramics, glass, paints, detergents and many other products.</p> <p class="p3">This means that moving to a low-carbon sustainable economy is not just a matter of decarbonising electricity production, transport, home heating and cooking. The key is to use the very substance that is damaging the planet, CO2, as the source of carbon, instead of oil and gas.</p> <p class="p3">This is already a viable technology on a small scale, although scaling up is hampered by difficulties in concentrating the CO2 from the air. While it is immensely damaging to the climate, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is still relatively low &ndash; currently 419 parts per million. This makes it challenging to extract from the air at an economically viable price, compared to fossil fuels.</p> <p class="p3">Luckily, there is a halfway house. Waste gases from highly polluting furnace industries &ndash; steel, cement and glass manufacture, for example &ndash; are rich in carbon oxides, both carbon dioxide and its relative, carbon monoxide. Bacteria are able to convert both carbon oxides into organic chemicals, such as ethanol, which is a substitute for petrol and a key feedstock for many chemical production processes.</p> <p class="p3">The final piece of the jigsaw to create the new carbon economy is cheap (&ldquo;green&rdquo;) hydrogen generated by splitting water using renewable electricity. Microbes can convert carbon monoxide directly, but to reduce CO2 they need hydrogen.</p> <p class="p3">Most such work is still at lab stage development. But some is up and running. After 15 years in development, the US firm LanzaTech opened a plant in China, which has been using commercial waste gases to produce ethanol since 2018. Sean Simpson, LanzaTech&rsquo;s co-founder and chief scientific officer, has described the process.</p> <p class="p3">First, the hot waste gases are piped into a bioreactor containing bacteria where they cool to 37C &ndash; the best temperature for bacteria to work their transformation. The carbon monoxide in the gases is the source of both carbon and the energy that the bacteria consume.</p> <p class="p3">The process runs continuously. A stream of liquid is drawn off from the reactor, containing some of the bacteria, ethanol and liquid media. The ethanol is then recovered by distillation, which kills the bacteria in the liquid stream. The bacteria are also recovered and can then be used a source of animal feedstuffs. The remaining liquid, without bacteria and ethanol, is then returned to the reactor and some nutrients are added.</p> <p class="p3">So, with only small additions of some nutrients (trace minerals), the bacteria continue to grow on the waste gases and the ethanol produced goes on to further processing.</p> <h2 class="p7">Flexibility, food and scaling up</h2> <p class="p5">What is so promising about LanzaTech&rsquo;s process is that, unlike many chemical processes that can only make one product from one starting material, the bacteria have a healthy appetite for carbon gases from different sources. Once pulling CO2 from the air becomes more economically viable, the plant could be adapted to use this process.</p> <p class="p3">The flexibility of LanzaTech&rsquo;s process also extends to the products. The bacteria can be genetically tweaked to produce many other chemical building blocks besides ethanol. This new form of carbon capture can be used to produce chemicals for plastics production, or fibres, or even food. This is where those headlines you might have seen come from: &ldquo;Fuel from the Air&rdquo; or &ldquo;Food from the Air&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">The prospects are exciting. However, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that when you read reports of startling innovative techniques that promise to address the world&rsquo;s pressing environmental problems you&rsquo;ve usually just read about a proof of principle, based on very small-scale lab work. What lies ahead is what the start-ups who try to commercialise these processes call &ldquo;the valley of death&rdquo;. Almost all fail. As Freya Burton, LanzaTech&rsquo;s chief sustainability officer, says: &ldquo;Everyone wants to be first to be second.&rdquo; Scepticism is so great that everyone is waiting for the pioneer to prove it can be viable.</p> <p class="p3">But LanzaTech are nevertheless scaling up at pace. Following the success of the pioneering Chinese plant, they have seven plants in construction and development globally, plus a second Chinese plant which started last year, and a third under construction.</p> <p class="p3">Two key examples of how this process feeds into large-scale product production involve synthetic fibres and detergents. LanzaTech&rsquo;s ethanol is being converted by the Indian company India Glycols Limited into monoethylene glycol, one of the precursors of polyester fabric yarn. The fabrics have already been used in a range of dresses by the retail fashion house Zara.</p> <p class="p3">To create a detergent for washing machines, LanzaTech teamed up with the consumer products giant Unilever. Here the same intermediary company, India Glycols Limited, turns the ethanol into ethylene oxide to begin the detergent production process. This flexibility to plug into existing processes instead of using new fossil input is a great attraction of the new bacterial production techniques.</p> <p class="p5">The final area in which bacterial carbon technology is coming into play is food. All our food conventionally originates from the CO2 of the air, via plants. But creating an alternative pathway could alleviate the enormous burden incurred in feeding the whole world by traditional farming.</p> <p class="p3">In this case, bacteria themselves are the product, in the form of single cell protein. Bacterially sourced foods have been around for decades, but they were always produced from fossil-fuel sources. Now the bacteria are grown on CO2. Some are genetically engineered to make replicas of natural proteins such as milk proteins. Milk is an emulsion containing many ingredients, but the key ones are proteins, fats and milk sugar. The Californian company Perfect Day has been marketing synthetic milk protein products such as ice cream since 2020. The precise animal milk proteins are cloned and expressed in a fungus.</p> <p class="p3">More radical still is the &ldquo;electric food&rdquo; pioneered by the Finnish company Solar Foods. The basis of all life is at root electricity &ndash; that is what is produced in some bacteria and all green plants by the process of capturing the sun&rsquo;s radiation. But some bacteria can live directly on electricity. Solar Foods use this process to make food proteins from, as they say, &ldquo;air and electricity&rdquo;. The component of the air they use is, of course, carbon dioxide.</p> <h2 class="p4">Bringing humanity back in line with nature&rsquo;s carbon cycle</h2> <p class="p5">The elements needed to create a new carbon economy are beginning to fall into place. And the ideas behind them may not be so new, after all. They were actually predicted as far back as 1894 by the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot, looking forward to the year 2000:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p6">&ldquo;The day will come when everyone will carry their little protein tablet, their little pat of fat, their little portion of starch or sugar, their little bottle of spices, tailored to their personal taste; all these will be synthesised economically and in inexhaustible quantities in our factories.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">He didn&rsquo;t envisage a role for bacteria, which he disdained for their association with disease and decay. It&rsquo;s taken humanity far too long to understand the role of bacteria on Earth. We, as medium-sized creatures, have historically found it hard to imagine the world of microbes. We must now develop our understanding of the planet as a conjoined world of the very small and the very large: of microbes and the global processes to which they give rise.</p> <p class="p3">The task of building the new Carbon economy deserves elevating to Moonshot or Manhattan Project scale. Alongside renewable energy, these new chemical processes can help to bring our life-support system back into alignment with planetary limits.</p> <p class="p3">We can carry on as we are, but if we do, we&rsquo;ll lose. An ecosystem that has run for over 4 billion years is not going to lie down before an upstart species that has tried to subvert it over a mere 10,000 years since the birth of farming. Unlike our present industrial support system, the new carbon economy would prove compatible with nature&rsquo;s own carbon cycle, the one that has been governing the Earth for billions of years. Both will be run by microbes &ndash; with a little help from humanity this time, rather than hindrance.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="has-medium-font-size"><em><img title="Believing oneself to be Napoleon Bonaparte is a classic " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/napoleon.jpg" height="900" alt="Napoleon Crossing the Saint-Bernard Pass by Jacques-Louis David." width="1200" /></em></p> <p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>Victoria Shepherd is a radio documentary and podcast producer, and a writer. We discuss her latest book, "A History of Delusions; the Glass King, a Substitute Husband and a Walking Corpse", a social history exploring an intriguing psychological phenomenon. </em></p> <p><strong>How did you come to write a book about delusions?</strong></p> <p>While working on a completely different project, I found a brief reference in a book about early modern Europe to Charles VI of France, a monarch who believed that he had <em>turned into glass</em>. Here was a king publicly embroiled in the Hundred Years War with England (a busy day job), but privately terrified that he would shatter if he sat down. It&rsquo;s an absurd scenario. But I listened more carefully to it and began to hear something more serious. To the "glass king&rdquo;, the situation is no less than life and death. The courts of Europe are laughing at him. A communiqu&eacute;, it&rsquo;s meaning encrypted, is smuggled inside the [delusional] belief, demanding an audience, attention and interpretation. I made a documentary about what become known as the more widespread psychological phenomenon called &lsquo;Glass Delusion&rsquo;, and then I was hooked as a historical detective of delusions.</p> <p><strong>You focus on the lives of ten people spanning over </strong><strong>six hundred years and ending in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. How are these cases relevant to us today?</strong></p> <p>I tell the stories of several individuals from the past who were <em>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</em> in their lifetimes, their outlandish stories sensationalised further by their fame. The delusions in my book are extreme &ndash; &ldquo;Technicolour&rdquo; with the volume turned up &ndash; but they are not as far removed from our own psychological strategies as we might imagine &hellip;As a historian, I&rsquo;ve gone on the trail and tried to catch traces of the real lives and struggles behind the case studies. To create an alternative reality for oneself, to go against the common-sense reality as generally agreed by everyone else, risks ridicule and social exclusion. The question then is: What is the delusion offering by way of help or protection that is worth that ridicule?</p> <p><strong>You define a delusion as "a fixed, false idea, not shared by others, unshakeable in the face of decisive evidence contradicting it." Yet they often appear to be communal &ndash; as a reaction to new technology, or a major historical event. </strong></p> <p>Let&rsquo;s return to the "glass king". Glass was a relatively new technology at the time, specifically &lsquo;plate&rsquo; glass developed in Rouen, which could be used in domestic windows. It was new in homes and had an alchemical magic to it: here was sand, heated to extreme temperatures, which then became transparent yet hard; breakable, beautiful, fragile. It&rsquo;s not hard to see how being &lsquo;made of glass&rsquo; might operate as an instruction to the world on how to treat you. &lsquo;Stay back, or you&rsquo;ll break me&rsquo;, you declare, but also &lsquo;I&rsquo;m precious; a treasure.&rsquo; &hellip;.</p> <p>I think the many people across early modern Europe who &lsquo;turned themselves into glass&rsquo; is a poetic example of how patterns and &lsquo;epidemics&rsquo; of delusions happen. Everyone was experiencing glass as a new material, with unique, contradictory qualities, at the same time. It&rsquo;s not surprising that many pegged their own anxieties and ambivalences onto it &ndash; even felt such an affinity with the material and its qualities that they melted <em>into it</em>.</p> <p>Collective trauma is often reflected in delusions. I tell the story of a clockmaker in post-revolutionary Paris who presented at an asylum saying that, despite surviving, he had in fact had his head chopped off by the guillotine, and &ndash; the most pressing complaint of all &ndash; that there had been a mix up in the basket and he had been given the wrong head in the confusion. The proof was that he had had perfect teeth, but this lot were all rotten, as he said.</p> <p>An individual&rsquo;s delusion usually represents a challenge to the generally accepted reality. Group delusions seem to contradict this.</p> <p>However, what I have observed looking back over hundreds of years of delusions is that people may have the same delusion at the same time, but they are not usually a collective experience. Quite the contrary. An experiment by the psychologist Milton Rokeach in a Michigan hospital in the early 1960s introduced three men to each other who all believed they were Christ. Being aware of each other&rsquo;s existence did not snap them out of their delusions, as Rokeach imagined it might. There was a violent fist fight instead.</p> <p><strong>Do we have a contemporary equivalent of the "Glass Delusion"? </strong></p> <p>Since the discovery of espionage bugging devices during the Cold War made front page news, people have presented to doctors claiming that there is, for example, a chip in their tooth, downloading their thoughts. I&rsquo;m sure that Artificial Intelligence will soon feature in delusions, alongside nano-technology.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think paranoic delusions, and delusions of grandeur, are the most common forms?</strong></p> <p>Delusions of grandeur are perhaps the clearest demonstration of how delusions function as a psychological strategy. They are useful in navigating a wretched existence or a humiliating reversal of fortune, or loss of autonomy in your life. It&rsquo;s not hard to see what putting on the costume of Napoleon, for example, might offer if you&rsquo;ve lost all sense of power and control. Dozens of men turned up at French asylums after the real Napoleon had died claiming that they were themselves Napoleon. Napoleon was the poster boy of self-made power: a boy from rural Corsica who had broken into the establishment to rule half the world. Delusions are not conscious decisions, but I&rsquo;ve come to see then as ingenious imaginative creations, sometimes beautifully simple.</p> <p>A paranoid conspiracy organises the enemy in a chaotic world and gives us a job to do; it offers a clear story, a plot to be foiled, villains and heroes, and puts the person with the delusion clearly on the side of good. We humans struggle to live with ambiguity and ambivalence. There is a clear correlation between a sense of belonging and paranoia. The lower the sense of belonging in a community, the higher the incidence of paranoia.</p> <p><strong>Why is it important to understand these stories in their historical context?</strong></p> <p>The picture is always incomplete and mysterious, and we have to live with the ambiguity. But</p> <p>understanding the historical context of a delusion gives glimpses of flesh-and-blood people dealing with difficult realities behind the case study pseudonyms. The themes are perennial &ndash; love, death, war &ndash; and specifics are gold dust. For example, I write about the case of &lsquo;L&eacute;a-Anna B.&rsquo;: a milliner in 1920s Paris and the poster girl for the delusion of &lsquo;Erotomania&rsquo; &ndash; the belief that a person of high status is in love with you (when they&rsquo;re not). She believed that King George V was madly in love with her, and travelled to London to stand outside Buckingham Palace and wait for a sign from the king as to when they should meet. &lsquo;L&eacute;a-Anna B.&rsquo; had, we learn, been dumped by her lover and ostracised in her rural community. It&rsquo;s a sad, personal journey. But it&rsquo;s also significant that her delusion appeared at the birth of Hollywood when the Silver Screen was projecting larger-than-life images of true love into towns and villages across the world for the first time.</p> <p><strong>Have women and men been susceptible to different kinds of delusions? </strong></p> <p>For centuries women were far less likely to consult a physician, so we can&rsquo;t know how many experienced, for example, glass delusion.</p> <p>We do know that women are well represented in accounts of delusions seemingly triggered by a relationship ending in humiliating or disreputable circumstances, and the financial and social ruin that followed. Margaret Nicholson, for example, doorstepped King George III at St. James&rsquo;s Palace with her claim that she was descended from Boudicca and the throne of England was rightly hers. Nicholson had worked hard in service for decades, supporting herself. No one had ever had a bad word to say about her, until one night someone in her household spied a valet leaving her room. They were both fired on the spot. The valet married someone else and quickly found a new place to live. We next find Nicholson outside St. James&rsquo;s Palace, with a blunt butter knife, making her grandiose claims.</p> <p>It wasn&rsquo;t only women who could fall out of good society in a moment, but a woman&rsquo;s route back was certainly more difficult, if not impossible. Nicholson spent the rest of her life in Bedlam.</p> <p><strong>What about today? </strong></p> <p>Almost (though not quite all) historical cases of &lsquo;Erotomania&rsquo; are women. The delusion is defined by a person believing someone of high status is in love with them (when they&rsquo;re not), so it&rsquo;s not surprising that the people experiencing the delusion are typically women in service or other low-pay jobs, and the &lsquo;lovers&rsquo; typically government officers and priests.</p> <p>Today, &lsquo;Erotomania&rsquo; still typically involves a woman who believes that a man of high status is in love with her. It&rsquo;s also true that practically speaking, today, &lsquo;Erotomania&rsquo; could also be described as &lsquo;stalking&rsquo; &ndash; the &lsquo;difference&rsquo; being a technicality, that the person presenting the delusion takes no responsibility for their behaviour &ndash; it&rsquo;s the other person who is in love. A man with this delusion might be more likely to be processed by the police as a criminal, rather than being logged by a clinician as delusional.</p> <p><strong>Do you think we are more, or less prone, in our own century, to delusional thinking?</strong></p> <p>The principal types of delusion have remained consistent for as long as there have been records, so it&rsquo;s fair to assume there have been delusions for as long as there have been people. Social anxiety, political chaos, and descent into poverty are all drivers for delusion. Since there&rsquo;s also strong evidence that lack of social connection and sense of belonging makes delusional thinking more likely, the appeal of an alternative reality is surely as strong today as it&rsquo;s ever been. It&rsquo;s certainly easier than it&rsquo;s ever been for invisible operators to curate alternative realities for us in our own homes, within our social media silos.</p> <p><strong>The book seems to ask us not to dismiss delusions, but instead to see them as potentially important forms of expression.</strong></p> <p>I&rsquo;ve come to see the meaning of delusions as imaginative creations &ndash; their meanings encoded or encrypted. In writing the book, I&rsquo;ve tried to pull up a chair, figuratively speaking, and listen. We all want to be worthy of attention and interpretation. Delusions communicate that something is amiss. The question is: what is it?</p> <p>The clinicians I&rsquo;ve met along the way, both in books and in real life, all seem to have come to the same conclusion, albeit from different directions &ndash; that the best chance of coaxing someone with a delusion back [to real life] is to meet them half-way, by entering a few steps into their alternative reality. It&rsquo;s certainly not to try to argue them out of it. That&rsquo;s not how a delusion functions. It may be better to view a delusion as vital scaffolding for a disordered life, and best not to dismantle it at all. Above all, I&rsquo;ve come to feel compassion and admiration for the imaginative ingenuity of people making use of delusions in order to navigate their difficult lives.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/curtain.jpeg" height="408" alt="Iron Curtain by Vesna Goldsworthy" width="408" /></strong></span></p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Iron Curtain: A Love Story (Chatto &amp; Windus) </strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">b</span></span><span class="s1">y Vesna Goldsworthy </span></p> <p class="p6">Vesna Goldsworthy&rsquo;s beautifully crafted third novel begins with a quote from Euripides&rsquo; <em>Medea</em>: &ldquo;Stronger than lover&rsquo;s love is lover&rsquo;s hate. Incurable in each, the wounds they make.&rdquo; This is followed by a prologue marking the fall of the Berlin Wall in December 1990. Both offer clues to the novel&rsquo;s denouement.</p> <p class="p7">The main narrative opens nine years earlier in 1981 and is set east of the Iron Curtain. Milena Urbanska is the privileged daughter of a Francophone mother and a father who is vice-president of an unnamed satellite of the Soviet Union. She and her boyfriend Misha, an architecture student, are members of the elite, and as such there are several rules which don&rsquo;t apply to them. Their families have servants (although calling them that is &ldquo;studiously avoided&rdquo;) and enjoy smuggled luxuries from the west. Misha drinks bitter lemon from Italy and owns &ldquo;the only LP of <em>Evita</em> this side of the Iron Curtain.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p7">Neither are particularly happy. While a certain level of opulence is achievable, it never fully compensates for the lack of cultural and political freedoms. We are given a glimpse of Milena&rsquo;s calculating nature early on when she admits: &ldquo;I wanted a boyfriend, he was good-looking and good in bed. The local choice was limited.&rdquo; However, the comforting familiarity of their relationship is abruptly curtailed when Misha dies in a senseless game of Russian roulette, a shocking act which Goldsworthy describes in spare, stark prose.</p> <p class="p7">Numbed by the tragedy, Milena buries herself in her studies and later accepts a job translating scientific papers in maize research. She resigns herself to her lot. When a literary conference is held in the state capital, she agrees to interpret for Jason Connor, an English poet who proudly claims to be a Marxist. Inevitably he falls for the cool, &ldquo;fierce&rdquo; red princess. She in turn is attracted to Jason&rsquo;s dishevelled nonchalance. &ldquo;He walked through the arrivals gate in a yellow T-shirt and a pair of faded jeans, with a tatty little canvas back-pack on his shoulder.&rdquo; At the end of their few, mostly &ldquo;chaperoned&rdquo; days together, Jason begs Milena to leave with him. She refuses at first &ndash; but months later she defects to London, where she discovers that the grass is not always greener.</p> <p class="p7">The novel is neatly divided into two parts: east and west. It&rsquo;s a polarity that Goldsworthy knows well, having come to the UK from Belgrade in 1986, when she was 24, to live with her British husband. A poet herself, she started writing in English, her third language, and has previously described the difficulties of straddling two cultures. She has dedicated her latest novel to &ldquo;my friends who, like me, grew up east of that line from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p7">In the second half of <em>Iron Curtain</em>, she deftly illustrates western hypocrisy and the rituals of wealth that are often baffling to an outsider. Milena arrives in December 1984. Her life with Jason is not what she had expected. Funded by a grant, he&rsquo;s studying for a PhD, writing and publishing his poetry, and renting student accommodation. They eventually move to a tiny one-bed flat in Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush. Milena&rsquo;s parents employ an agent to keep an eye on her and, on receiving reports of their daughter&rsquo;s poverty, send her money.</p> <p class="p7">Goldsworthy exhibits a keen eye for detail in her droll portrayal of Jason&rsquo;s well-to-do family. They inhabit a draughty farmhouse with no central heating, and put the dogs&rsquo; needs before those of their fellow human beings. Milena drily observes: &ldquo;The wine was some of the best I&rsquo;d ever tasted, but the food was disgusting.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p7">Goldsworthy&rsquo;s evocative descriptions of both worlds &ndash; the rigid ice of the east and the damp monotony of the west &ndash; lend a filmic quality to this layered novel. Rather than suggesting that love can conquer all divides, the couple&rsquo;s story ends with a twist. The book&rsquo;s prologue suggests one outcome Milena could not have predicted.</p> <p class="p7"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

              <h2><a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5996/is-monogamy-morally-wrong#utm_source=rss">Is monogamy morally wrong?</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="A section of the " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/HYMYC5.jpg" height="946" alt="'The Arnolfini Portrait' by Jan Van Eyck" width="1600" /></p> <p class="p1">For many generations in societies shaped by Christianity, monogamy has been the almost undisputed champion of relationship norms. In Britain and the US, it has been held up as the dominant &ndash; really the only &ndash; ideal for serious romantic partnerships, toward which all of us should always be striving. According to the authors of a 2019 article in <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior</em>, focused on the US context, a &ldquo;halo surrounds monogamous relationships . . . monogamous people are perceived to have various positive qualities based solely on the fact they are monogamous.&rdquo; Other relationship models, or even just being persistently single, have often been seen as suspect, if not morally wrong.</p> <p class="p3">Things are starting to change, though. Progressives, at least, increasingly exhibit a greater open-mindedness about intimate pairings that are not expected to be exclusive. There is growing awareness of alternatives to monogamy, such as polyamory: roughly, valuing or engaging in more than one sexual or romantic relationship at a time.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Monogamy as a social norm</span></h2> <p class="p3">The feminist critique of compulsory monogamy is compelling. According to Lori Watson, professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, &ldquo;the practice and enforcement of monogamy within marriages has largely served the interests of men.&rdquo; Throughout history, men have wanted to ensure their children are really theirs: that way, any property they bequeath ends up with their biological offspring. She concludes that &ldquo;the idea that this and only this arrangement is conducive to respectful, loving relationships is myopic &ndash; and arguably in service of shoring up the dominant position men have traditionally enjoyed.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Of course, men in contemporary societies often also face stigma for missing monogamous benchmarks. They may be accused of having &ldquo;commitment issues&rdquo; or &ldquo;failing to settle down&rdquo; if they resist, however thoughtfully or deliberately, the pervasive pressure to find a &ldquo;soulmate&rdquo; (and eschew all others). Philosopher Justin Clardy argues that heterosexual African American men who are ethically polyamorous (with the willing agreement of all concerned) are nevertheless often harmfully stereotyped as &ldquo;players&rdquo; &ndash; that is, as men who are assumed to &ldquo;just want sex&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">Even people who identify as non-binary or genderqueer are far from immune to these kinds of pressures. Like members of the gay community who led the push for same-sex marriage in the early 2000s, they know that pursuing a monogamous relationship can gain you at least partial acceptance from a society that regards you as &ldquo;other.&rdquo; Historians will remind us that not everyone in the gay community was on board with same-sex marriage. Some saw it as a regrettable capitulation to overly restrictive relationship norms; an unreasonable price to pay for relatively respectful treatment from &ldquo;straight&rdquo; society.</p> <p class="p3">Until recently, however, critics of monogamy have tended not to oppose it in principle. Rather, they have argued that we should be free to craft our relationships according to our own preferences and needs. As long as all parties are mature adults and agree to the plan, who is anyone else to judge?</p> <h2 class="p4">Power and control</h2> <p class="p5">Harry Chalmers, for one. He is part of a growing cadre of philosophers arguing that monogamy itself may be morally wrong. In his 2019 paper &ldquo;Is Monogamy Morally Permissible?&rdquo; published in the <em>Journal of Value Inquiry</em>, he argued against a laissez-faire perspective that sees both monogamy and non-monogamy appropriately sitting on the menu of options. Instead, he writes: &ldquo;We morally ought to reject monogamy.&rdquo; To be clear, Chalmers thinks people should be free to have one, and only one, sexual or romantic partner in any given period. What he thinks is wrong, rather, is the common practice of placing restrictions on how one&rsquo;s partner may act with others &ndash; in terms of sexual contact or emotional intimacy &ndash; as a condition of continuing the relationship.</p> <p class="p3">It isn&rsquo;t only Chalmers who is making this argument. Justin Clardy, the philosopher of African American polyamory I cited earlier, has also recently argued against the moral permissibility of what he calls &ldquo;intimacy confining constraints&rdquo; (even among polyamorists). These are defined as &ldquo;categorical&rdquo; restrictions on additional intimate relationships, whether sexual or &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; &ndash; as in the concept of &ldquo;emotional cheating&rdquo; &ndash; when one is in at least one such relationship already.</p> <p class="p3">Finally, in a forthcoming book chapter, Norwegian philosopher Ole Martin Moen, along with his co-author, the nurse and trans activist Aleksander S&oslash;rlie, makes a similar point.</p> <p class="p3">All of these writers appeal to an argument by analogy, focused on the case of friendships. Consider the following:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p7">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say that two friends, Jack and Jane, both love reading and often get together to discuss literature. Then Jack says to Jane that he thinks discussing literature is &lsquo;their thing&rsquo;, and that he will remain friends with her only on the condition that she does not discuss literature with anyone else &ndash; and, indeed, that this rule applies even on days when Jack is out of town, when he is busy doing other things, or when he just doesn&rsquo;t feel like hanging out or talking with Jane.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">That&rsquo;s the version of the argument from Moen and S&oslash;rlie. &ldquo;In this case,&rdquo; they remark, &ldquo;it seems clear that Jack&rsquo;s requirements are not okay; they are controlling and restricting beyond what is acceptable.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Let&rsquo;s say we agree. &ldquo;Importantly,&rdquo; Moen and S&oslash;rlie continue:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p7">&ldquo;Jack would not be able to justify this requirement by appealing to the claim that, in fact, Jane only wishes to discuss literature with him. The reason this justification does not work is that insofar as this really is the case, the requirement is redundant. The requirement is relevant, and kicks into action, only insofar as Jane might in fact want to discuss literature with someone else; the requirement serves the purpose of discouraging her from doing so. But if exclusivity requirements are not okay in the case of friendships, why are they okay in the case of romantic relationships?&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">Well, you might be thinking, because friendships (and discussing literature) and romantic relationships (and having sex) are different in various ways that justify a different standard. For example, having sex with someone risks pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, whereas discussing literature typically risks neither.</p> <p class="p5">In their respective writings, Chalmers, Clardy, Moen and S&oslash;rlie address this and other anticipated objections, arguing that, despite appearances, the claimed differences do not amount to a morally relevant distinction &ndash; at least not one that can ground a categorical restriction on extra-relational intimacy, whether physical or emotional, among romantic partners.</p> <p class="p3">For example, they point out that many forms of sexual interaction do not risk pregnancy, and that the risk of STIs, where relevant, can be reduced with safe sex practices. They also urge that the alleged &ldquo;specialness&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the special value &ndash; of a romantic relationship need not be diminished by having other such relationships: each person, and so each relationship, is unique.</p> <p class="p3">Sure, they say, we may be accustomed to thinking of sexual intimacy as fundamentally different from other forms of intimacy, like those we associate with &ldquo;Platonic&rdquo; friendship, but cultural constructs can be unlearned. Intimacies of various kinds can be important life goods, and we should want our partners, just like our friends, to be as free as possible to pursue what is good for them.</p> <p class="p3">So, they conclude, demanding monogamy of a partner &ndash; lest you withdraw your care and affection from them, or pull the plug on the whole relationship &ndash; is an illegitimate exercise of power. It&rsquo;s controlling.</p> <p class="p4">A couple of things seem to be conflated here. It&rsquo;s one thing to be in a close relationship that is <em>not</em> based on an assumption of monogamy, and then, out of nowhere, to spring a &ldquo;change of rules&rdquo; unilaterally. (&ldquo;As of today, if you are sexually intimate with anyone else besides me, I will end this relationship and cut off ties.&rdquo;) Although you have a right to leave a relationship you don&rsquo;t want to be in &ndash; for any reason &ndash; taking this route would not reflect well on your character.</p> <p class="p3">It&rsquo;s another thing, though, to make clear from the outset that, in deciding whether to invest in a serious, close relationship with someone, a shared interest in monogamy is important for you. You might say, &ldquo;Listen, if you and I don&rsquo;t share this particular value, that is totally fine. I just don&rsquo;t think that we are best suited to being long-term romantic partners.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be objectionably controlling.</p> <h2 class="p3">The importance of communication</h2> <p class="p3">Yet as Chalmers, Clardy and the others point out in their work, many people may mistakenly believe they value monogamy. Perhaps their belief is based on questionable assumptions about love: that it is a limited resource or zero-sum game, for example. Or perhaps the belief is based on morally dubious motives, such as a desire to claim or possess another person as a way of avoiding insecurity. Or, perhaps, those who think they value exclusivity simply haven&rsquo;t thought about it enough.</p> <p class="p3">There&rsquo;s no doubt that many people endorse monogamy unreflectively. Maybe most of us do. But it seems a stretch to assume this applies to everyone. So let us suppose that, in at least some cases, a well-considered, mutual agreement to be monogamous could be what is best for a couple. Based on their particular life-histories, psychologies, preferences, values and the dynamic between them, it just so happens that if each one pledges to be tied to the metaphorical mast (and to hold the other accountable while the sirens sing) this will maximise their chances of a happy relationship.</p> <p class="p3">Neither party has an independent obligation to &ldquo;get serious&rdquo; with anyone, much less specifically the other person. And each one is free to have certain desires for the kind of relationship they would like to invest in. Assuming they talk things through in advance, and no one pressures the other into making an agreement to be exclusive when that is not what the other person truly wants, it is hard to see how monogamy as such could be immoral.</p> <p class="p3">Granted, this is not how monogamous arrangements are typically pursued. Instead, there is often a presumption on the part of one partner that the other wants to be, and will be, monogamous, and when this doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be true, hearts break. Explicit communication would clearly be better. So why does it so often fail to happen?</p> <p class="p3">According to its critics, the sheer power and pervasiveness of monogamy as a social norm work against such communication. Either there is an automatic assumption of monogamy, so that raising a question about it doesn&rsquo;t even occur to you; or, there is a desire not to be monogamous, so that raising a question about it puts you at risk of being rejected by someone you&rsquo;ve come to care about, or even denigrated or socially stigmatised.</p> <p class="p5">So here is where the critics get it right. Monogamy should not be the automatic default position. That way, the need for communication would be obvious to everyone, because a preference for monogamy could not be simply assumed.</p> <p class="p3">At the same time, ethical alternatives to monogamy should be given a much bigger seat at the table. Societies should hold up examples of well-conducted non-monogamous relationships so that people can get a better sense of how they work. They won&rsquo;t be for everyone, but they will be best for some.</p> <p class="p3">In their righteous effort to knock monogamy off its pedestal, however, Chalmers and the others go too far. A mutual expectation between partners that neither will get romantically involved with others is not inherently morally wrong.</p> <p class="p3">Instead, as Bryan R. Weaver and Fiona Woollard argued in an important article published in <em>The Monist</em> in 2008, there are good and bad reasons for, and ways to pursue, monogamy. The bad ways involve making unwarranted presumptions, unreflective decisions, or being controlling, possessive or manipulative. The good ways involve clear, upfront communication, respect between parties, and equal standing to decide how things should go.</p> <p class="p3">We can and should object to the bad ways of pursuing monogamy, which may be the main ways it is currently pursued. But we shouldn&rsquo;t rule it out in principle, condemning all who would ever try to make it work. Let us all be more reflective, more open-minded and communicative. And then let us say: to each their own.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>….unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>….leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>….becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>…buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There’s a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
