            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">But it&#8217;s so intuitive! The idea that the less people know, the more they have an unwarranted confidence that they know more than they do, seems to explain so much. There is now <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/critical-thinking/dunning-kruger-effect-probably-not-real">evidence that the Dunning-Kruger Effect is an artifact</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The two papers, by Dr. Ed Nuhfer and colleagues, argued that the Dunning-Kruger effect could be replicated by using random data. “We all then believed the [1999] paper was valid,” Dr. Nuhfer told me via email. “The reasoning and argument just made so much sense. We never set out to disprove it; we were even fans of that paper.” In Dr. Nuhfer’s own papers, which used both computer-generated data and results from actual people undergoing a science literacy test, his team disproved the claim that most people that are unskilled are unaware of it (“a small number are: we saw about 5-6% that fit that in our data”) and instead showed that both experts and novices underestimate and overestimate their skills with the same frequency. “It’s just that experts do that over a narrower range,” he wrote to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then I have to rethink who it applies to. We&#8217;re so used to pointing at stupid people doing stupid things and explaining it as Dunning-Kruger in action, and it&#8217;s not.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important mistake people make about the Dunning-Kruger effect, according to Dr. Dunning, has to do with who falls victim to it. “The effect is about us, not them,” he wrote to me. “The lesson of the effect was always about how we should be humble and cautious about ourselves.” The Dunning-Kruger effect is not about dumb people. It’s mostly about all of us when it comes to things we are not very competent at.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait wait wait. So <em>I</em> may have been a victim of the Dunning-Kruger Effect when I thought I knew what the Dunning-Kruger Effect was about? Dang. Well, that was a good solid punch in the balls to start my morning. But then, it&#8217;s always good to rethink your assumptions and reconsider your ideas, so thank you very much may I have another?</p>
<blockquote><p>Are there dumb people who do not realize they are dumb? Sure, but that was never what the Dunning-Kruger effect was about. Are there people who are very confident and arrogant in their ignorance? Absolutely, but here too, Dunning and Kruger did not measure confidence or arrogance back in 1999. There are other effects known to psychologists, like the overconfidence bias and the better-than-average bias (where most car drivers believe themselves to be well above average, which makes no mathematical sense), so if the Dunning-Kruger effect is convincingly shown to be nothing but a mirage, it does not mean the human brain is spotless. And if researchers continue to believe in the effect in the face of weighty criticism, this is not a paradoxical example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. In the original classic experiments, students received no feedback when making their self-assessment. It is fair to say researchers are in a different position now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, what, so maybe I&#8217;m not afflicted with Dunning-Kruger? OK, I need to get out of the house and take a walk now.</p>

<p class="lead">I&#8217;m still going to criticize <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/new-evidence-that-grandmothers-were-crucial-for-human-evolution-88972191/">it</a>, though. </p>
<blockquote><p>For years, anthropologists and evolutionary biologists have struggled to explain the existence of menopause, a life stage that humans do not share with our primate relatives. Why would it be beneficial for females to stop being able to have children with decades still left to live?</p>
<p>According to a study published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the answer is grandmothers. “Grandmothering was the initial step toward making us who we are,” says senior author Kristen Hawkes, an anthropologist at the University of Utah. In 1997 Hawkes proposed the “grandmother hypothesis,” a theory that explains menopause by citing the under-appreciated evolutionary value of grandmothering. Hawkes says that grandmothering helped us to develop “a whole array of social capacities that are then the foundation for the evolution of other distinctly human traits, including pair bonding, bigger brains, learning new skills and our tendency for cooperation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess I&#8217;m personally inclined to appreciate the importance of grandmothers, having had a pair of good ones myself, and seeing how much time my wife invests in our granddaughter, but I&#8217;m less impressed with the study, which is based entirely on a computer simulation. I don&#8217;t trust simulations of complex phenomenon that necessarily have to simplify all the parameters. What about aunts and sisters? What about uncles?</p>
<p>What about the <em>grandfathers</em>?</p>
<p>None of those individuals are of interest, because this version of the hypothesis is structured around explaining menopause as the product of selection. Nope, I don&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<blockquote><p>But why would females evolve to only ovulate for 40 or so years into these longer lives? Hawkes and other advocates of the hypothesis note that, without menopause, older women would simply continue to mother children, instead of acting as grandmothers. All children would still be entirely dependent on their mothers for survival, so once older mothers died, many young offspring would likely die too. From an evolutionary perspective, it makes more sense for older females to increase the group’s overall offspring survival rate instead of spending more energy on producing their own.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to accept the benefit of an extended family and social cooperation, but the effort to justify menopause seems misplaced. There are many grandmothers who are not menopausal, and there would have been even more in ancient populations, where pregnancy shortly after the onset of menstruation would have been common. It also doesn&#8217;t explain the contributions of sisters and aunts to childrearing, or that brothers and sisters, who are also &#8220;distractions&#8221; from the business of raising a single delicate child. Why couldn&#8217;t it benefit a woman to raise her own child born late and also contribute to the well-being of grandchildren born to previous offspring? I suspect the simulation has assumptions built into the code about how much grandparental investment can be offered if they also have a child.</p>
<p>But, yeah, <em>what about the grandfathers</em>?</p>
<p>We help, too. So why isn&#8217;t there a male menopause where our testicles shrivel up and make us more willing to contribute to child-rearing? A man has a certain number of progeny, then boom, the reproductive urge goes away and he has to sit down and focus on taking care of the kids he&#8217;s got. Or his grandchildren. Or his nieces and nephews. That would be the logical endpoint of this arch-selectionist model, after all, and what&#8217;s good for the goose is good for the gander.</p>
<p>Yet somehow people feel compelled to come up with adaptationist explanations for accidents of evolutionary history.</p>

<p class="lead">As if Mark Meadows wasn&#8217;t already sleazed enough by his association with the Trump White House, last year it was revealed that he was also <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2019/10/02/a-tangled-web-of-lies-about-dinosaurs/">entangled with creationists, like Ken Ham and Joe Taylor</a>, starred in a documentary about a creationist &#8220;expedition&#8221; to find an allosaurus, with a lot of backstabbing among the various unpleasant protagonists. Now there are <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/27/mark-meadows-has-skeletons-in-the-closet--dinosaur-skeletons-to-be-precise/">new revelations</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe this isn&#8217;t the worst criminal offense, but the part that offended me most was that in the original documentary, they played up the fact that Mark Meadows&#8217; 9 year old daughter was the one who discovered the fossil dinosaur. Except, as it turned out, she hadn&#8217;t. The whole &#8220;discovery&#8221; was contrived media hype. Oh, look, a little girl found the evidence that disproved evolution!</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Raising the Allosaur&#8221; was successful enough that it spurred Phillips to create the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival in 2004. Just before the festival opened, however, Phillips had to yank the film: It turned out that the skeleton had not in fact been discovered by Haley Meadows, but had been uncovered two years earlier by Dana Forbes, the landowner who eventually sold the site to Meadows. A paleontologist named Joe Taylor had identified the skeleton as an allosaur in May 2001, a year before Meadows&#8217; trip. When these facts were exhumed they mired Phillips&#8217; documentary in controversy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, yuck. Meadows <em>knowingly</em> had his own daughter join him in an outright lie, put her into a movie <em>lying</em> about her role, and set her up for public exposure. That&#8217;s disgraceful. I hope she someday escapes this poisonous creationist trap.</p>
<p>Of course, there is some comeuppance.</p>
<blockquote><p>This led to a bitter dispute over who owned the dinosaur. Before the conference, Phillips sent out a letter to attendees that said &#8220;a series of ethics-based issues have been brought to our attention,&#8221; leading him to suspend sales of his film &#8220;pending a season for Creation Expeditions to appropriately address the aforementioned issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creation Expeditions posted a note to its website claiming that its ministry had &#8220;endured an outrageous attack.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>[Who is Phillips? What is &#8220;Creation Expeditions&#8221;? Doesn&#8217;t matter. This is a tangled web of lies and shifting alliances. This is creationism!]</p>
<p>In other news, Meadows bought the plot of land the fossil was on, and sold it to Answers in Genesis and didn&#8217;t bother to report the rather substantial income from the sale. The second saddest fate is that of the Allosaur fossil, which was also sold to AiG (they have so much money!) in a deal funneled through a &#8220;charity group&#8221; and which also ripped off a fellow creationist.</p>
<blockquote><p>The allosaur eventually found its way to the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, which is owned by Answers in Genesis. That group received the skeleton as a donation in May 2014 from a charity group that had bought the fossil from Taylor, the paleontologist.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a bad deal that we had to accept,&#8221; Taylor told the New Yorker, who said the dispute mediation with Creation Expeditions would have left him nearly $100,000 in debt and destroyed his business. He sold the fossils for about $125,000 to a Christian foundation, which eventually donated them to the museum. At that time the estimated market value of the allosaur was about $450,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>But remember, Christians are the moral people.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="Pavlensky after cutting off his earlobe on the roof of the Serbsky Center, 2014" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Пётр_Павленский.jpg" alt="Pavlensky after cutting off his earlobe on the Serbsky Center, 2014" /></p> <p class="p1">Cynicism is widespread, largely unwilled, and viewed as an affliction. It has no redeeming features, or so we are taught to think.</p> <p class="p3">This was not always the case. The word &ldquo;cynicism&rdquo; once referred to a lived philosophy that originated in the ancient Greek world. It was renowned, even respected. Not bad for a tradition that treated the humble fart as a mode of communication and taking a shit as a worthy argument. I&rsquo;ll come back to that.</p> <p class="p3">Modern cynicism has been blamed for a multitude of ills, ranging from the rise of &ldquo;post-truth&rdquo; and the alt-right to the weakening of liberal democracy and progressive politics. It has been denounced from all positions on the political spectrum for its negativity, for its ability to sap energy from hopeful activity, and for providing so many excuses to do nothing when so much needs to be done. From this perspective, cynicism teaches a harsh, nihilistic lesson:</p> <p class="p5"><em>Everything is bad. Nothing can be done about it. Let&rsquo;s do nothing.</em></p> <p class="p3">But there are many faces to modern cynicism: from the cynicism of the powerful and monied, prepared to manipulate others to further their own interests, to that of the disempowered who have nothing left to lose. And then, somewhere between, is the insider cynicism of those who understand the real workings of institutions and know well the inane and unjust processes they serve to uphold.</p> <p class="p3">Although the first type of cynicism (that of Donald Trump or Boris Johnson, for example) might be easily denounced, it is not clear that the latter two cynicisms &ndash; the insider and alienated forms &ndash; deserve the kind of blanket dismissal they usually receive. Indeed, modern cynicism might not be as dangerous and corrupting as some claim.</p> <p class="p3">For instance, as an attitude, modern cynicism is often expressed reluctantly. We often say &ldquo;I hate to be cynical but. . .&rdquo; This cynicism appears before itself as if it were a personal flaw, or something that is better left private. We are, in effect, quite good at policing our own cynicisms.</p> <p class="p3">Cynical remarks also function as a way of letting off steam, or as an excuse for moving on. After saying something cynical one might add: &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ve said my piece. . .&rdquo; In effect, a cynical outburst can provide an excuse to retreat from the harsh criticisms just aired. Many cynicisms appear, moreover, to be only half-believed, hence a remark might be introduced by the phrase: &ldquo;If I was to be cynical I would say. . .&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Lastly, cynicism is what allows people to stay in their jobs, especially insider cynics, who might justify their position with the words: &ldquo;Well if I didn&rsquo;t do it, then somebody else would.&rdquo; This can be another way of saying, &ldquo;Better the devil you know&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">So modern cynicism is not necessarily a threat to the institutions, social beliefs and political attachments it appears to question. In fact, it may have a role in allowing these establishments to continue: by giving people a way to let off steam, by keeping critique active and yet restrained, and by ensuring that people stay on the job &ndash; cynical, but still in large part obedient.</p> <p class="p3">While cynicism appears at first sight to be critical and doubting, a cynic may remain closely attached to the status quo they lament. It is worth asking, then, what a stronger, more deliberate cynicism might look like &ndash; a cynicism that is developed and enhanced, rather than dismissed and denied.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p6">Although anybody can be a cynic today, cynicism was once represented by a tiny group of highly accomplished, well-practised eccentrics. In its early form, it was a radical philosophy with no rules or doctrines. It certainly had nothing you could describe as an easily identifiable teaching.</p> <p class="p3">Its most famous representative was Diogenes of Sinope: a non-propertied, impoverished exile who lived on the streets of Athens in the fourth century BCE. Diogenes did all he could to upset and disgust his host community. He lived like a dog and was known as such.</p> <p class="p3">There is the story of a dinner at which people tossed bones at Diogenes as they would to a dog. Diogenes responded by acting the part, cocking his leg at them in turn. Diogenes embraced his caricature, injuring the dignity of those he pissed on, acting without modesty or shame. His cynicism was intended as an outrage. It set out to question and undermine all social values and cultural attachments. With Diogenes, we encounter cynicism in its strongest, most dangerous and unrelenting form.</p> <p class="p3">As a radical philosophy, cynicism was also highly improvised. The most famous anecdotes we inherit from ancient cynicism, the stories that we take as the defining acts of cynic courage, were initially shaped by the context in which they first appeared. They only became defining acts of cynic transgression in retrospect.</p> <p class="p3">For example, Diogenes is famous for living in a barrel or storage jar on the street. Much has been made of this barrel, in which he would not just sit but roll about. Yet when Diogenes first arrived in Athens, so the story goes, he only adopted the barrel because the house he had hoped for could not be arranged in time.</p> <p class="p3">So, ancient cynicism does not provide a direct model, or set of practices, for any revived modern cynicism to follow. As an improvised philosophy, it developed tactical, carefully targeted attacks that were designed to call into question the culture in which it was expressed, a culture that is not our own, even if it is a distant relative.</p> <p class="p3">What ancient cynicism does provide a model for, however, is a mode of transgression that exceeds all politically acceptable notions of &ldquo;revolt&rdquo;. The logic, or, some might say, the illogic of cynic transgression is what we might attend to.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p6">The transgressive element of ancient cynicism is often explained away. Given the extent to which cynicism was designed to upset those it confronted, it is understandable that this should be the case. Indeed, the history of cynicism is marked by progressive efforts to sanitise and purify the example set by the first cynics.</p> <p class="p3">There is a common interpretation of what Diogenes was up to when he threw away all his possessions and lived a deliberately impoverished &ldquo;animal&rdquo; life on the streets of Athens. From this point of view the lesson of cynicism is a simple one:</p> <p class="p5"><em>Look how little I need to be happy. All the material and intellectual culture of civilised life is a distraction. You should all live a simple life like me, a life in accordance with nature.</em></p> <p class="p3">This is not my interpretation. Diogenes does not say &ldquo;live like me&rdquo;; nor does he present the model of a better life. Rather, he makes the point that all conventions are essentially arbitrary. In so doing, Diogenes gestures to the possibility of another life, to a radical reorganisation of the material world and the world of ideas.</p> <p class="p3">When Alexander the Great approached Diogenes, standing over him as he was sunning himself, he said, &ldquo;Ask me for anything you want.&rdquo; Diogenes replied, &ldquo;Stand out of my light.&rdquo; This is one of the most famous cynic anecdotes. It has been subject to multiple interpretations, most notably the idea that the cynic will criticise power in the very face of it, with courage and without exception.</p> <p class="p3">But cynic critique is directed elsewhere too. It does not only address prominent examples of tyranny. It even targets those who might come for instruction. As Diogenes apparently said: &ldquo;Other dogs bite their enemies, but I bite my friends, so as to save them.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">There is the story of a student who came up to Diogenes and asked to study with him. Diogenes responded by giving the student a piece of cheese to carry. The would-be follower threw it away in disgust. To follow Diogenes with a hunk of cheese (or a dead fish in a variation of the story) would be to act as his slave. What the student failed to understand is that to follow cynicism is to embrace humiliation and overcome shame, since fear of shame is one of the most effective mechanisms for ensuring social conformity.</p> <p class="p3">There are variations on the theme, where Crates (who was Diogenes&rsquo; pupil) famously converted Metrocles to cynicism with a well-timed and kindly fart. Timing is key to another famous anecdote; the case of Diogenes shitting before an audience. Diogenes, so the story goes, gave a public oration that was very well received, and, when his audience was most enraptured, squatted before them and emptied his bowels. One interpretation is that, having disgraced himself so completely, Diogenes has nothing else to lose. He has no cause to flatter or dupe his audience. The point at which to begin listening is after he shits.</p> <p class="p3">Another interpretation is that we are ashamed and repelled by the wrong things. The audience might express disgust at the cynic who shits, but is happy to live with all other sorts of disgusting behaviour, such as greed, vanity, patronage, a slave economy and state-sanctioned violence. Or, at least, the audience has a less visceral response to them. They don&rsquo;t flinch in the same way. The cynic effectively asks: &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p6">The role and prominence of the cynic body are crucial. Cynic practices focused on the body and its excretory and sexual functions because, from a cynic perspective, the body is the means by which we are governed. Social conventions act through the organisation of bodily habits. They regulate what goes in, what comes out, and where and how that happens.</p> <p class="p3">The habits that regulate speech are just another case in the government of bodies. This is why, from a cynic perspective, the organisation of speech is equivalent to the regulation of intestinal gas. Giving the latter an airing in places it should not be expressed challenges power, just as the disorganisation of speech, the refusal of convention, its eruption when speech is not welcomed, challenges the order of things.</p> <p class="p3">By disrupting these conventions, cynicism demonstrates that the body must be at the centre of any revolt. We are governed by the most banal habits, the cynic teaches, but these habits can be changed.</p> <p class="p3">Then what about cynic timing? Well, Diogenes does his business precisely when his audience is most enraptured. He has just demonstrated his skill at public oration and has shown that even as an impoverished alien, he is fully conversant with cultural and intellectual norms. Diogenes has clearly mastered the art of rhetoric and proved his eloquence. Why reject all that? Why reject your host community once it has finally accepted you? There is no easy answer to this question.</p> <p class="p3">Here, I think, ancient cynicism shows that it was determined in its transgressions to confound, confuse and resist easy explanation. As a non-dogmatic philosophy, it did not explain itself or set out the principles that underlay its practices. It did not even explain what, precisely, it found so objectionable in the culture that surrounded it or why it rejected, point-by-point, all the dominant values of its day. Instead, it provokes those who are insulted to begin asking themselves that very question: why on earth the cynic before them holds the audience in such contempt.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p6">What does this mean for a revived cynicism? Well, clearly such a cynicism should not be expected to explain what it argues for.</p> <p class="p3">In today&rsquo;s intellectual culture, the typical response to all harsh criticisms is to ask the critic to justify their position. There is also the expectation that all good critics will have an alternative in mind, some vision of a better state of affairs. The cynic perspective clearly undercuts and disregards the assumption that all good critics are guided by their principles. In response to the demand &ldquo;explain yourself&rdquo;, the cynic remains silent.</p> <p class="p3">This demand is the first challenge that would face a returned Diogenes, who, emerging from his barrel, would soon be moved on by the authorities, or convicted and institutionalised. Diogenes would be taken as an object of study. Most probably, he would be pathologised and his actions explained away as the result of some kind of personal or social disorder.</p> <p class="p3">And yet, despite these challenges, is not impossible to imagine a revived, undomesticated cynicism. We do not have to look too hard for examples. There is the case of the Russian performance artist Pyotr Pavlensky, for instance, who sewed his mouth shut in protest against the incarceration of members of Pussy Riot in 2012. The year after, he had himself brought naked and wrapped in barbed wire to the main entrance of the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg and later that year, he nailed his scrotum to Red Square. Pavlensky also cut off his earlobe while sitting naked on the roof of a prominent psychiatric hospital in 2014, and, after receiving asylum in France in 2017, set fire to the entrance of the Bank of France in Paris.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p6">Although Pavlensky is not an avowed cynic, several parallels with cynic protest might be drawn: his use of his body to manifest the truth of political oppression, his commitment to suck the authorities into his art so that they become participants in the spectacle, and finally, his ingratitude to the community that finally grants him asylum.</p> <p class="p3">Pavlensky is a good example of cynicism (in a way that Banksy, to take another possible example, is not), because he is, for many, so unlikeable. His example helps make the point that cynicism must remain unpalatable. It is cynical to the extent it remains in contempt of the norms it challenges.</p> <p class="p3">A revived cynicism does not have to model itself on the example of the lone, courageous cynic aggressor, however. Cynicism today is, after all, a mass phenomenon, even if it is weakened and shy by contrast. Like ancient cynicism, it holds a mirror to the society in which it appears.</p> <p class="p3">The typical response to contemporary cynicism is to argue that cynical attitudes should be remedied by injecting hope and optimism, by social and institutional reform, and by redoubling arguments for the values it places in doubt. But this, from a cynic perspective, is precisely the problem. It ensures that criticism and cynic doubt remain within accepted boundaries. The commitment to remain positive, to find secure ground, is, the cynic observes, precisely how social norms are transmitted, untroubled, through one upheaval to the next.</p> <p class="p3">Of course, there is no principled way to argue for cynicism, since to argue in that manner would be to operate uncynically. At best, a cynic perspective draws attention to cynicisms where they emerge and does not assume, outright, that they should be diminished.</p> <p class="p3">These cynicisms give expression to important intuitions about the state of the world whilst offering nothing positive back. Many would see this as a flaw. And yet, from a different perspective, it gives cynicism the edge. What the philosophy offers, in effect, is a form of critical perception that remains forever vigilant. It doubts all promises and makes none in return.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2020 edition. </em><em><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>The bad science I want to talk about today isn’t the usual deranged ignorant fool you can laugh at. No, it’s a bad idea that is usually presented seriously, by serious people, and it drives me up a wall.</p>
<p>I am speaking of theistic evolution.</p>
<p>What triggered me today was an essay that expressed concern that half the students in the country think evolution is atheistic, that you need to discard your belief in god to accept evolution. That, of course, is not true — humans are adept at believing all kinds of contradictory beliefs, and I’m quite accustomed to, for instance, pre-med biology students who are enthusiastic fans of professional sports that cause frequent concussions. I’m not one to tell students that they can’t possibly be a biologist unless they discard their belief in gods.</p>
<p>You know that movie, God’s Not Dead? One of the ridiculous aspects of that movie was a professor who demanded that his students sign a statement of disbelief in gods. We don’t do that. It’s the antithesis of good teaching, actually, and also, chattering about metaphysics and theology is a waste of time in a science class. There is simply no debate here.</p>
<p>But in this essay, the author annoyed me from the very beginning. She points out that many of our students think they do have to be an atheist to accept evolution. She writes</p>
<blockquote><p>Does someone have to be an atheist to accept evolution? According to the philosophy of science and many science educators the answer is no. However, my recent study has revealed that over half of college biology students in the United States think that in order to accept evolution fully, they would have to be an atheist. This is a challenge if we want to increase acceptance of evolution in a country were almost half of the residents do not think humans evolved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fine, although I think these students are equating “atheism” with the rejection of certain narrow tenets of a particular religious dogma. Unfortunately, her solution to this misperception by students is…to bring more religion into the science classroom. We are supposed to accommodate the believers, and reassure them that their superstition is just fine.</p>
<p>No. This is going too far. I already accommodate my religious students enough by not engaging in time-wasting discussions of the religious implications of the science we’re learning. I would simply tell them, if asked, that the Bible and the Koran are not science textbooks, that they have us nothing to teach us about biology, and I might concede that perhaps we could learn something about human history and relationships from the holy book, but every single one of them lacks any novel or useful information about biology.</p>
<p>I am also not happy that these kinds of essays are always exercises in assumptions that atheism is a scary horrible idea that frightens the children and scares them away from  evolution. If it’s scary, that’s not the fault of atheism: that’s a perception promoted by the religious people and by way too many well-meaning people who see a general philosophical position as a problem for education. What if, in order to accept evolution, you DID have to be an atheist? Where is the tragedy in that? Do you think disbelief in gods is a tragic outcome that leads to dissolute, destroyed lives? Because it doesn’t. Maybe one solution to the aversion to evolution because of a mistaken belief that it turns you into an atheist should be to teach people to be more tolerant of differences in beliefs about gods.</p>
<p>But, as always, the conversation is always about softening the implications of scientific materialism to be nice to the fundamentalists.   So the author has 3 recommendations.</p>
<p>The first is to teach the bounded nature of science.</p>
<blockquote><p>The bounded nature of science is the assertion that science only has the means to answer questions about the natural world using natural explanations and cannot address questions regarding supernatural phenomenon. Whether someone understands and accepts the bounded nature of science might determine whether he or she considers evolution to be atheistic or agnostic. </p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, boy, shall we teach agnosticism in the science classroom then? This will not solve any of the conflicts between religion and science. Fine, tell the students that they should be agnostics; I guarantee you that the devout members of the local conservative Baptist church will be quite certain that you are teaching satanism. Because, of course, if we’re going to take this sensible approach and discuss the limitations of science, we’ll also have to discuss the limitations of religion. And then the explosions will begin.</p>
<p>No thanks. I’ll steer clear of those landmines, but if you tell me I MUST discuss the value of reassuring the evangelical Christians on the wisdom of a compromise with agnosticism, I’ll be ready to defend myself. Because it won’t be the atheists rising up in outrage at this line of thinking.</p>
<p>OK, is her second suggestion any better?</p>
<blockquote><p>Discuss religious scientists that accept evolution. Theodosius Dobzhansky famously said in a 1973 essay that “Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution” but what people do not usually realize is that he also argued for compatibility between religion and evolution in that very same essay. Dobzhansky was a pioneer of the modern evolutionary synthesis of evolution and genetics and was also religious. Francis Collins is director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States and headed the human genome project. A staunch defender of the importance of evolution, he is also an evangelical Christian and he founded the organization BioLogos to promote harmony between evolution and religion. Kenneth Miller is a Catholic biologist who famously argued against the teaching of intelligent design in science classes during the Kitzmiller vs Dover trial and wrote a book on the compatibility between his faith and evolution. Discussing these scientists can highlight where evolution and religion can be compatible and give students an opportunity to see their own religious identity reflected among authoritative scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it is not. You see, I don’t hesitate to discuss the scientific work of Dobzhansky and Collins and Miller — I don’t discuss Biologos because it does not add any science to the conversation — and in fact, I don’t see the point to talking about the religious beliefs of any of the scientists I might discuss in the classroom. Do I also need to say that Darwin was an agnostic, or that TH Morgan and Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin are atheists?</p>
<p>I notice that we aren’t discussing the idea of presenting brilliant atheist scientists are renowned and successful in their fields as examples for why it is not such a terrible thing to be an atheist.  Why not? Wouldn’t legitimising atheism also be a good way to reduce the conflict with evolution?</p>
<p>Her third idea is the worst. We’re supposed to discuss theistic evolution in the classroom.</p>
<blockquote><p>Theistic evolution is the belief that a supernatural deity is somehow responsible for evolution. A person can fully accept every tenant of evolution, including the common ancestry of life on earth and still think this was somehow the work of a supernatural creator. Highlight theistic evolution as a concrete way that someone can believe in God/god(s) and accept evolution. If you do not believe in God/god(s) resist the urge to project your own beliefs onto evolution. Evolution is by definition agnostic rather than atheistic, and therefore both an atheistic and theistic view can be compatible with the scientific theory of evolution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yuck. No. No way. When I teach science, I teach observation and experiment and analysis. There is no substance to theistic evolution: the deity has not been observed, is not subject to experiment, and there ain’t no data about his being to study. When I teach how mitochondria work, I talk about Peter Mitchell’s chemiosmotic theory, we go through the elements of the redox reactions in the membrane, we learn all about ATP synthase, we look at those cool experiments in which the pH was modified or ionophores were used to remove the proton gradient. I do not then suggest that some people might comfort in the idea that a god is personally directing the proton traffic. Yet for some reason, people are comfortable telling evolutionary biologists that hey, despite the lack of evidence, just maybe there’s a supernatural deity shuttling mutations around to produce the illusion of a Designer.</p>
<p>I will be among the first to tell you that science is value-laden, and that there are all kinds of societal biases that affect our scientific interpretations and priorities. But this goes all ways. All too often we have to deal with a bias that favours religious interpretations, and belittles secular ideas. The secular ideas are presented as the obstacle, the problem that needs to be fixed, rather than the all-pervasive god-soaked religiosity of our country being the significant barrier. We atheists are expected to be the ones to bend, and it’s always pointless — bending towards professing agnosticism is damned stupid.</p>
<p>There is no conflict with agnostics. There is no conflict with liberal religion that is willing to accept scientific ideas (I guarantee you, Francis Collins and Ken Miller aren’t storming into PTA meetings to curse science textbooks.) The suggested ways to resolve the conflict aren’t going to even touch the problem.  The conservative/evangelical/fundamentalists who embrace creationism will not be appeased by a) encouraging a more agnostic perspective, b) highlighting a few people who combine Christianity and evolution, who are all probably going to hell, and c) whispering a few mealy-mouthed platitudes about theistic evolution, which the problematic religions all reject anyway.</p>
<p>I also have to point out that all the waffly talk about agnosticism is not only going to be ineffectual, it’s operationally false. It is literally true that science has to be agnostic on the matter of gods, because we can’t say for sure that there isn’t some cosmic intelligent being rattling around in the woodwork, however we can say that all the religions that people actually practice, that make claims about the nature and history of the material universe, are false. They’re wrong. That I don’t use the science classroom to trumpet that news to my students isn’t because I’m unsure, but because it is entirely irrelevant to the subject at hand.</p>
<p>As usual, though, this particular problem in educating people about science is blamed on the atheists, rather than the ignorant conservative religious folk who are fed a steady diet of malicious propaganda. Just once I’d like to see one of those sociological studies try not to see atheism as the problem, but rather that the entirety of the conflict is resting on the dogma of certain religions.</p>
<p>OK, gang, I’ll stop there. I’m not planning to talk about the atheist perspective here very much, because I have been burned by a few too many clueless atheists who use their philosophy to justify way too many social biases. However, through it all I am still an adamant atheist who isn’t going to stand by while someone tries to tell me I have to use religious apologetics as a didactic technique.  Today I’m going to let you watch the names of my patrons scroll by on a background consisting of all the scientific evidence for any gods at all. Look closely or you might miss it!</p>

A corpse is found dead in a locked room, clearly killed by a third party who cannot have escaped but is also no longer inside. An unimpeachable witness sees a murderer striking down their victim in central London, while 12 others can prove that the culprit was eating dinner with them at that same moment, ten miles away in Wimbledon. A bride is found dead in her cabin on her Nile cruise honeymoon, while the two main suspects &ndash; her husband and his former fianc&eacute;e &ndash; are both incapacitated and under close observation.</p> <p class="p3">These are all scenarios from mystery novels published during the so-called Golden Age of detective fiction, usually defined as occurring between 1920 and 1940. And that last plot is from <em>Death on the Nile</em>, Agatha Christie&rsquo;s iconic 1937 novel that has now been adapted into a glamorous, blockbuster film directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh. Even all these decades later, Christie&rsquo;s story is still delightfully baffling. People can&rsquo;t be in two places at once, nor can guns miraculously be fired through walls.</p> <p class="p3">Although it continues to bewitch readers and cinema-goers alike in the 21st century, this story belongs to a tradition that reached its zenith in the two decades between the First and Second World Wars. A mania for puzzles of all sorts broke out in the British public and whodunnits like <em>Death on the Nile</em> were part of this broader trend.</p> <p class="p3">As well as a boom in sales of crime fiction, crosswords, treasure hunts and word games all became hugely popular pastimes as people tried to throw off the hard years of the First World War by engaging their brains in a new way. Christie even managed to combine these enthusiasms when she was hired in 1930 by the Isle of Man tourist board to create a short story that was also a treasure hunt, in order to encourage visitors to the island. Her story &ldquo;Manx Gold&rdquo; was distributed in newspapers and as pamphlets to hotels so that visitors could follow the clues to real buried treasure hidden in snuffboxes around the island.</p> <p class="p3">By the time the Golden Age was coming to a close with the advent of the Second World War, explaining away apparent impossibility was a staple of the crime novel.<em> Death on the Nile </em>isn&rsquo;t strictly a full &ldquo;impossible crime&rdquo; or a &ldquo;locked room&rdquo; mystery &ndash; there are other potential suspects on the boat, for instance &ndash; but it does turn on that central impossibility of how someone could be in two places at once without the intervention of the supernatural.</p> <p class="p3">Besides Christie, other Golden Age novelists like John Dickson Carr and Christianna Brand (known today for her &ldquo;Nurse Matilda&rdquo; books, adapted into the <em>Nanny McPhee</em> films) were turning out impeccably impossible mysteries that somehow eventually resolved into plausible explanations. Creating these plots required great precision and skill: in her 1947 book <em>Suddenly at His Residence</em>, Brand went so far as to keep the solution a secret until the very last sentence.</p> <p class="p3">These writers were part of a pedigree that had its roots much further back than 1920, when Christie published her first detective novel. The origins of the impossible crime are inextricably connected to the very earliest whodunnits from the 19th century. As the form developed through the 1800s, it relied heavily on the advancing understanding of science to keep readers guessing: if a particular scientific idea was not well known by the public, then its revelation could be a surprising solution to a crime story.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">Like many aspects of detective fiction, the origins of the impossible crime can be traced back to Edgar Allen Poe. There had been &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; events in fiction before him, of course &ndash; Gothic and sensation fiction are full of unexplained disappearances and manifestations &ndash; but it wasn&rsquo;t until Poe&rsquo;s story &ldquo;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&rdquo; was published in 1841 that the idea of a detective unravelling such a crime with logic and reason emerged. Poe&rsquo;s sleuth C. Auguste Dupin solves the apparently unsolvable murder of two women, killed in a locked room on the fourth floor of a Parisian apartment building, with &ldquo;ratiocination&rdquo;, or logical deduction.</p> <p class="p3">In the decades that followed, writers and police alike kept pace with science. The analysis of footprints, fingerprints, fabric fragments, bloodstains and more all appeared in the detective&rsquo;s arsenal, and became clues that the creator of an impossible crime must explain away. Scientific knowledge became valuable currency for detective writers, through either extensive research or collaboration. The prolific Irish writer L. T. Meade, for instance, formed a literary partnership with the British medical doctor Robert Eustace in order to create crime stories that skirt the boundary between science fact and science fiction. In one tale from their 1899 collection <em>The Brotherhood of the Seven Kings</em>, there is a murder attempt by X-ray, with the victim sickening after being unknowingly exposed in his sleep night after night.</p> <p class="p3">Arthur Conan Doyle, of course, is a titanic figure in mystery writing. Not all of the Sherlock Holmes stories feature impossible crimes &ndash; some are just old-fashioned whodunnits &ndash; but as a doctor himself, he couldn&rsquo;t resist sometimes introducing his professional knowledge into his fiction. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s most audacious use of a scientific idea to explain an impossible crime occurs in 1903&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Adventure of the Empty House&rdquo;, in which Holmes and his sidekick Dr Watson are confronted with a shooting inside a locked room that cannot have been self inflicted. The victim&rsquo;s window was open at the time of the murder, but nobody nearby heard the &ldquo;boom&rdquo; that a gun capable of shooting at such a distance would have made. The quiet sniper rifles used in the First World War and after were still a decade or more away; the police are baffled.</p> <p class="p3">To solve the crime, Holmes uses himself as bait, setting up a dummy behind a well-lit blind in his Baker Street flat. He has the satisfaction of catching the shooter in the act with &ldquo;an admirable and unique weapon, noiseless and of tremendous power&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s an unusual airgun of German manufacture. When its mechanism is pumped up to full pressure, it is capable of propelling a bullet over a great distance with almost no sound at all. The gun is such a curiosity that Holmes sends it to &ldquo;embellish the Scotland Yard museum&rdquo; once the culprit is safely in custody.</p> <p class="p3">Once the 20th century was in full swing, writers found it much harder to find scientific solutions that would reliably baffle the reading public. The crime reporter Edgar Wallace fell foul of this problem when he tried his hand at mystery fiction with <em>The Four Just Men</em> in 1905. While the book was serialised in the <em>Daily Mail</em>, Wallace offered cash prizes for anyone who could work out the solution before the last chapter was published. Unfortunately, he didn&rsquo;t put an upper limit on the number of winners, presumably believing that nobody would guess that electricity could be deployed as a murder weapon via telephone line. The resulting flood of correct solutions nearly bankrupted him and he had to sell the rights to the novel for &pound;75 to recoup his losses.</p> <p class="p5">The writers who took up the challenge of the impossible crime after that, such as G. K. Chesterton and R. Austin Freeman, began to move the genre on &ndash; away from the shock of new science and technology and towards the psychology of the people involved in crime. Stories like Chesterton&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Invisible Man&rdquo; helped to lay the foundation for what would come with writers like Christie in the Golden Age. The invisible man isn&rsquo;t invisible because of some special serum he&rsquo;s drunk or because of some clever trick with a mirror, but because the unreliable, flawed people observing him can&rsquo;t see him.</p> <p class="p3">Christie built her writing career on this principle: the idea that truth can be out in plain sight, but ordinary observers are so blinkered by their assumptions and prejudices that they can be fooled into not seeing it. That&rsquo;s why stories like <em>Death on the Nile</em> are still being adapted and retold today. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times we experience the reveal &ndash; turning something fantastically impossible into a mundane possibility never ceases to amaze.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2020 edition. </em><em><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><strong><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/caste.jpg" alt="caste" /></strong></p> <p><strong>Caste: The Lies That Divide Us</strong> (Allen Lane) by Isabel Wilkerson</p> <p>No Democratic president has won the majority of white-American votes since 1963, Isabel Wilkerson notes towards the end of this timely, important work. That year, Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the civil rights act, which, after four centuries, finally conferred citizenship upon African-Americans. Johnson predicted that the Democrats would lose the southern states for a generation. This prophecy was a serious understatement. These racial faultlines continue to define US politics to this day.</p> <p>In Caste, Wilkerson &ndash; a journalist who, in 1993, became the first African-American woman to win a Pulitzer &ndash; argues that racism is an insufficient term for the systemic oppression of black people in America, describing it instead as a caste system. The book offers a searing description of the nature of caste &ndash; a stratified, internalised hierarchy &ndash; which is instructive far beyond America&rsquo;s elections. Wilkerson frames racism as the skin of something deeper; complex structures that determine standing and respect, assumptions of competence and access to resources.</p> <p>As Wilkerson explains, we assert and confer status subconsciously, by &ldquo;knowing without thinking that you are one up from another, based on rules not set down on paper&rdquo;. The perceived rise of lower castes &ndash; through increased political agency and demographic change &ndash; can prompt fear amongst those in the top caste, something which has recently played out in US politics: &ldquo;Contrary to wistful predictions of post-racial harmony . . . anti-black attitudes rose, rather than fell . . . in Obama&rsquo;s first term.&rdquo;</p> <p>Caste does not shy away from describing the performative violence that ensures that the bottom rung remains immovable, making this work both vivid and at times tough going. This includes well-known examples, such as Jim Crow-era lynchings. The descriptions of entire towns cheering on vigilante murder chime with caste-based atrocities in India. Other parallels are less well known, such as the obsession with purity that the American caste system shares with India&rsquo;s &ndash; for example, the imagined pollution of swimming pools by African-American bodies.</p> <p>The book peels back the layers of the social mechanics that maintain America&rsquo;s rigid hierarchy. This is what the American dream has been built on, and it is far from predetermined by the simplistic western notion of &ldquo;race&rdquo;. As Wilkerson shows, almost all rungs of the American caste system are allowed to dream, as long as they partake in the subjugation of those at the bottom: African-Americans, upon whose misery waves of new citizens have gained validation, in a literal economic sense as well as spiritually. As Wilkerson writes: &ldquo;Who are you if there is no one to be better than?&rdquo;</p> <p>A common assertion on the left is that supporters of Donald Trump, particularly working-class voters, are &ldquo;voting against their interests&rdquo;, but Wilkerson argues that this analysis misses a fundamental point. &ldquo;Many voters, in fact, made an assessment of their circumstances and looked beyond immediate short-term benefits . . . to preserve what their actions say they value most &ndash; the benefits they had grown accustomed to as members of the historically ruling caste in America.&rdquo;</p> <p>Caste provides a lucid description of dynamics that extend far beyond the States. Caste systems, most notably India&rsquo;s, work through the continual struggle of caste groups in the churn of societal ladder-climbing, as they aspire for status by worship of the highest echelons of the caste, while simultaneously distancing themselves from and subjugating those at the bottom. &ldquo;Everyone in the caste system is trained to covet proximity to the dominant caste.&rdquo;</p> <p>As discussions of race and racism take on great urgency this year with the global Black Lives Matter movement, Caste gives us a timely insight into why, despite changes in the law and seemingly progressive reforms in the United States and elsewhere, our societies are still plagued by ancient tribalisms.</p> <p><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2020 edition. </em><em><a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p4"><strong>quarantine</strong> <em>from 14th century Venetian quarantena, meaning &ldquo;40 days&rdquo;</em></p> <p class="p4">The word &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo; has become part of our daily lives. According to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, it first crops up in English when Christians describe the place where Jesus fasted for 40 days &ndash; written about in 1470 as &ldquo;a wilderness of quarantine&rdquo;. This comes from post-classical Latin &ldquo;quarentena&rdquo; referring to this same Biblical event. It was also used to describe the 40 days a widow could remain in her deceased husband&rsquo;s dwelling (!). A further root comes via French &ldquo;quarantaine&rdquo;, the collective for 40.</p> <p class="p5">The modern meaning &ndash; the isolation imposed on people to prevent the spread of contagious diseases &ndash; first appears in English in 1635, probably influenced by the Venetian use of the word (as &ldquo;quarantena&rdquo;). The port of Venice could demand that crews on foreign ships stayed on board for 40 days to prevent the plague spreading. In 1663, Samuel Pepys logged a quarantine of 30 days for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>ships, showing that the word was free from its &ldquo;40 days&rdquo; length. In Daniel Defoe&rsquo;s<em> Journal of the Plague Year</em> &ndash; a chilling book to read today &ndash; he writes: &ldquo;Not a Quarentine of days only, but a Soixantine, not only 40 days but 60 days or longer.&rdquo; Perhaps we should watch out.</p> <p class="p5">Just before the First World War, nurses noted that a quarantine of 12 days was required after people were exposed to &ldquo;Asiatic Cholera&rdquo;. The UK&rsquo;s pet travel scheme was announced in 2000 to avoid the &ldquo;need for quarantine&rdquo;. The word has been used politically to mean blockade or boycott: in 1937, President Roosevelt suggested a collective quarantine of aggressor nations. JFK proposed a quarantine of Cuba in response to the military build-up.</p> <p class="p5">The word entered the world of computers in 1988 as a means of keeping out the &ldquo;viruses&rdquo; of the cybersphere and that&rsquo;s where we are now: struggling to prevent the transmission of a contagious virus.</p> <p class="p5">Governments have a range of words to choose from when creating legislation. The advantage (or disadvantage) of using &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo; is its connotations of enforced isolation of animals, cargoes and plagued sailors stretching back 400 years or more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>I am delighted to launch a new series of videos that use magic to celebrate science. Fab sleight of hand artist Will Houstoun and I produced them, supported by The Royal Society of Chemistry and chemist Dr Suzanne Fergus (University of Hertfordshire). The three videos use sleight of hand techniques to celebrate a different scientist, and do not involve any CGI or camera trickery. </p>



<p>We are excited about this new story telling technique and recently conducted an experiment that showed that it significantly boosted people&#8217;s engagement (details <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://peerj.com/articles/9610/" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>

              <h2><a href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2020/10/14/how-parapsychology-changed-psychology/">How parapsychology changed psychology</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I recently co-authored a paper on how a little-known parapsychology journal was years ahead of its time.</p>



<p>Our story starts in 2011, when psychologist Daryl Bem reported several experiments that appeared to support the existence of psychic ability. Soon after, Stuart Ritchie, Chris French and I tried to replicate the studies but obtained null results. Several other academics also criticised Bem&#8217;s statistics and procedures. This type of &#8216;I have evidence for psychic ability &#8211; Oh no you don&#8217;t&#8217; back and forth has occurred many times over the years. However, this time, something odd happened.</p>



<p>Several researchers noted that the criticisms aimed at Bem’s work also applied to many studies from mainstream psychology. Many of the problems surrounded researchers changing their statistics and hypotheses after they had looked at their data, and so commentators urged researchers to submit a detailed description of their plans <strong>prior</strong> to running their studies. In 2013, psychologist Chris Chambers played a key role in getting the academic journal <em>Cortex</em>&nbsp;to adopt the procedure (known as a Registered Report), and many other journals quickly followed suit.</p>



<p>However, many academics are unaware that a little-known parapsychology journal &#8211; The European Journal of Parapsychology &#8211; implemented an early version of this concept in the 1970s. For 17&nbsp;years,&nbsp;around half of the studies in the paper were registered in advance. If the critics were right, these papers should be less likely to contain problems with their statistics and methods, and so be more likely to report spurious positive results. To find out if this was the case, I recently teamed up with Caroline Watt and Diana Kornbrot to examine the studies. The results were as expected &#8211; around 8% of the analyses from the studies that had been registered in advance were positive, compared to around 28% from the other papers. Other academics are now conducting the same sort of analyses in psychology and medicine, and finding the same pattern.</p>



<p>Academics often criticise parapsychology, but this episode is a good example of how the field is sometimes ahead of the game and can help to improve mainstream psychology. <br><br>The full paper describing this work is <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/6232/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>And Diana is now looking more broadly at openness in science. If you are a researcher with an interest in the area, you can take part in her survey <a href="https://herts.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EfYxgOn9SNkadD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>In this episode of the podcast, Sam discusses the recent social protests and civil unrest, in light of what we know about racism and police violence in America.</p>
<p>This is a transcript of a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/207-can-pull-back-brink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded podcast</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Welcome to the Making Sense podcast… This is Sam Harris.</p>
<p>OK…. Well, I’ve been trying to gather my thoughts for this podcast for more than a week—and have been unsure about whether to record it at all, frankly.</p>
<p>Conversation is the only tool we have for making progress, I firmly believe that. But many of the things we most need to talk about, seem impossible to talk about.</p>
<p>I think social media is a huge part of the problem. I’ve been saying for a few years now that, with social media, we’ve all been enrolled in a psychological experiment for which no one gave consent, and it’s not at all clear how it will turn out. And it’s still not clear how it will turn out, but it’s not looking good. It’s fairly disorienting out there. All information is becoming weaponized. All communication is becoming performative. And on the most important topics, it now seems to be fury and sanctimony and bad faith almost all the time.</p>
<p>We appear to be driving ourselves crazy. Actually, crazy. As in, incapable of coming into contact with reality, unable to distinguish fact from fiction—and then becoming totally destabilized by our own powers of imagination, and confirmation bias, and then lashing out at one other on that basis.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to talk about the current moment and the current social unrest, and its possible political implications, and other cultural developments, and suggest what it might take to pull back from the brink here. I’m going to circle in on the topics of police violence and the problem of racism, because that really is at the center of this. There is so much to talk about here, and it’s so difficult to talk about. And there is so much we don’t know. And yet, most people are behaving as though every important question was answered a long time ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching our country seem to tear itself apart for weeks now, and perhaps lay the ground for much worse to come. And I’ve been resisting the temptation to say anything of substance—not because I don’t have anything to say, but because of my perception of the danger, frankly. And if that’s the way I feel, given the pains that I’ve taken to insulate myself from those concerns, I know that almost everyone with a public platform is terrified. Journalists, and editors, and executives, and celebrities are terrified that they might take one wrong step here, and never recover.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdsmxzaHtSQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>And this is really unhealthy—not just for individuals, but for society. Because, again, all we have between us and the total breakdown of civilization is a series of successful conversations. If we can’t reason with one another, there is no path forward, other than violence. Conversation or violence.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to talk about some of the things that concern me about the current state of our communication. Unfortunately, many things are compounding our problems at the moment. We have a global pandemic which is still very much with us. And it remains to be seen how much our half-hearted lockdown, and our ineptitude in testing, and our uncoordinated reopening, and now our plunge into social protest and civil unrest will cause the Covid-19 caseload to spike. We will definitely see. As many have pointed out, the virus doesn’t care about economics or politics. It only cares that we keep breathing down each other’s necks. And we’ve certainly been doing enough of that.</p>
<p>Of course, almost no one can think about Covid-19 right now. But I’d just like to point out that many of the costs of this pandemic and the knock-on effects in the economy, and now this protest movement, many of these costs are hidden from us. In addition to killing more than 100,000 people in the US, the pandemic has been a massive opportunity cost. The ongoing implosion of the economy is imposing tangible costs, yes, but it is also a massive opportunity cost. And now this civil unrest is compounding those problems—whatever the merits of these protests may be or will be, the opportunity costs of this moment are staggering. In addition to all the tangible effects of what’s happening—the injury and death, the lost businesses, the burned buildings, the neighborhoods that won’t recover for years in many cities, the educations put on hold, and the breakdown in public trust of almost every institution—just think about all the good and important things we cannot do—cannot even <em>think</em> of doing now—and perhaps won’t contemplate doing for many years to come, because we’ll be struggling to get back to that distant paradise we once called “normal life.”</p>
<p>Of course, normal life for many millions of Americans was nothing like a paradise. The disparities in wealth and health and opportunity that we have gotten used to in this country, and that so much of our politics and ways of doing business seem to take for granted, are just unconscionable. There is no excuse for this kind of inequality in the richest country on earth. What we’re seeing now is a response to that. But it’s a confused and confusing response. Worse, it’s a response that is systematically silencing honest conversation. And this makes it dangerous.</p>
<p>This isn’t just politics and human suffering on display. It’s philosophy. It’s ideas about truth—about what it means to say that something is “true.” What we’re witnessing in our streets and online and in the impossible conversations we’re attempting to have in our private lives is a breakdown in epistemology. How does anyone figure out what’s going on in the world? What is real? If we can’t agree about what is real, or likely to be real, we will never agree about how we should live together. And the problem is, we’re stuck with one other.</p>
<p>So, what’s happening here?</p>
<p>Well, again, it’s hard to say. What is happening when <a href="https://youtu.be/viika57hTO4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a police officer or a mayor takes a knee</a> in front of a crowd of young people who have been berating him for being a cog in the machinery of systemic racism? Is this a profound moment of human bonding that transcends politics, or is it the precursor to the breakdown of society? Or is it both? It’s not entirely clear.</p>
<p>In the most concrete terms, we are experiencing widespread social unrest in response to what is widely believed to be an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at the black community by racist cops and racist policies. And this unrest has drawn a counter-response from law enforcement—much of which, ironically, is guaranteed to exacerbate the problem of police violence, both real and perceived. And many of the videos we’ve seen of the police cracking down on peaceful protesters are hideous. Some of this footage has been unbelievable. And this is one of many vicious circles that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>Again, there is so much to be confused about here. We’ve now seen endless video of police inflicting senseless violence on truly peaceful protesters, and yet we have also seen video of the police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrVp8vlQyU">standing idly by</a> while looters completely destroy businesses. What explains this? Is there a policy that led to this bizarre inversion of priorities? Are the police angry at the protesters for vilifying them, and simultaneously trying to teach society a lesson by letting crime and mayhem spread elsewhere in the city? Or is it just less risky to collide with peaceful protesters? Or is the whole spectacle itself a lie? How representative are these videos of what’s actually going on? Is there much less chaos actually occurring than is being advertised to us?</p>
<p>Again, it’s very hard to know.</p>
<p>What’s easy to know is that civil discourse has broken down. It seems to me that we’ve long been in a situation where the craziest voices on both ends of the political spectrum have been amplifying one another and threatening to produce something truly dangerous. And now I think they have. The amount of misinformation in the air—the degree to which even serious people seem to be ruled by false assumptions and non sequiturs—is just astonishing.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep in mind that, with the presidential election coming in November, the stakes are really high. As most of you know, I consider four more years of Trump to be an existential threat to our democracy. And I believe that the last two weeks have been very good for him, politically, even when everything else seemed to go very badly for him. I know the polls don’t say this. A large majority of people disapprove of his handling this crisis so far. But I think we all know now to take polls with a grain of salt. There is the very real problem of preference falsification—especially in an environment of intense social pressure. People will often say what they think is socially acceptable, and then think, or say, or do something very different in private—like when they’re alone in a voting booth.</p>
<p>Trump has presided over the complete dismantling of American influence in the world and the destruction of our economy. I know the stock market has looked good, but the stock market has become totally uncoupled from the economy. According to the stock market, the future is just as bright now as it was in January of this year, before most of us had even heard of a novel coronavirus. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. And a lot can happen in the next few months. The last two weeks feel like a decade. And my concern is that if Trump now gets to be the law-and-order President, that may be his path to re-election, if such a path exists. Of course, this crisis has revealed, yet again, how unfit he is to be President. The man couldn’t strike a credible note of reconciliation if the fate of the country depended on it—and the fate of the country has depended on it. I also think it’s possible that these protests wouldn’t be happening, but for the fact that Trump is President. Whether or not the problem of racism has gotten worse in our society, having Trump as President surely makes it seem like it has. It has been such a repudiation of the Obama presidency that, for many people, it has made it seem that white supremacy is now ascendant. So, all the more reason to get rid of Trump in November.</p>
<p>But before this social unrest, our focus was on how incompetent Trump was in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. And now he has been given a very different battle to fight. A battle against leftwing orthodoxy, which is growing more stifling by the minute, and civil unrest. If our social order frays sufficiently, restoring it will be the only thing that most people care about in November. Just think of what an act of domestic terrorism would do politically now. Things can change very, very quickly. And to all a concern for basic law and order “racist”, isn’t going to wash.</p>
<p>Trust in institutions has totally broken down. We’ve been under a very precarious quarantine for more than 3 months, which almost the entire medical profession has insisted is necessary. Doctors and public health officials have castigated people on the political Right for protesting this lockdown. People have been unable to be with their loved ones in their last hours of life. They’ve been unable to hold funerals for them. But now we have doctors and public officials by the thousands, signing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letters</a>, making public statements, saying it’s fine to stand shoulder to shoulder with others in the largest protests our nation has ever seen. The degree to which this has undermined confidence in public health messaging is hard to exaggerate. Whatever your politics, this has been just a mortifying piece of hypocrisy. Especially so, because the pandemic has been hitting the African American community hardest of all. How many people will die because of these protests? It’s a totally rational question to ask, but the question itself is taboo now.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that almost everything appears upside down at the moment.</p>
<p>Before I get into details on police violence, first let me try to close the door to a few misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the proximate cause of all this: The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. I’ll have more to say about this in a minute, but nothing I say should detract from the following observation: That <a href="https://youtu.be/vksEJR9EPQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> was absolutely sickening, and it revealed a degree of police negligence and incompetence and callousness that everyone was right to be horrified by. In particular, the actions of Derek Chauvin, the cop who kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes, his actions were so reckless and so likely to cause harm that there&#8217;s no question he should be prosecuted. And he is being prosecuted. He’s been indicted for 2nd degree murder and manslaughter, and I suspect he will spend many, many years in prison. And, this is not to say “the system is working.” It certainly seems likely that without the cell phone video, and the public outrage, Chauvin might have gotten away with it—to say nothing of the other cops with him, who are also now being prosecuted. If this is true, we clearly need a better mechanism with which to police the police.</p>
<p>So, as I said, I&#8217;ll return to this topic, because I think most people are drawing the wrong conclusions from this video, and from videos like it, but let me just echo everyone&#8217;s outrage over what happened. This is precisely the kind of police behavior that everyone should find abhorrent.</p>
<p>On the general topic of racism in America, I want to make a few similarly clear, preemptive statements:</p>
<p>Racism is still a problem in American society. No question. And slavery—which was racism’s most evil expression—was this country’s founding sin. We should also add the near-total eradication of the Native Americans to that ledger of evil. Any morally sane person who learns the details of these historical injustices finds them shocking, whatever their race. And the legacy of these crimes—crimes that were perpetrated for centuries—remains a cause for serious moral concern today. I have no doubt about this. And nothing I’m about to say, should suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>And I don’t think it’s an accident that the two groups I just mentioned, African Americans and Native Americans, suffer the worst from inequality in America today. How could the history of racial discrimination in this country not have had lasting effects, given the nature of that history? And if anything good comes out of the current crisis, it will be that we manage to find a new commitment to reducing inequality in all its dimensions. The real debate to have is about how to do this, economically and politically. But the status quo that many of us take for granted to is a betrayal of our values, whether we realize it or not. If it’s not a betrayal or your values now, it will be a betrayal of your values when you become a better person. And if you don’t manage that, it will be a betrayal of your kid’s values when they’re old enough to understand the world they are living in. The difference between being very lucky in our society, and very unlucky, should not be as enormous as it is.</p>
<p>However, the question that interests me, given what has been true of the past and is now true of the present, is what should we do next? What should we do to build a healthier society?</p>
<p>What should we do next?  Tomorrow… next week…. Obviously, I don’t have the answers. But I am very worried that many of the things we’re doing now, and seem poised to do, will only make our problems worse. And I’m especially worried that it has become so difficult to talk about this. I’m just trying to have conversations. I’m just trying to figure these things out in real time, with other people. And there is no question that conversation itself has become dangerous.</p>
<p>Think about the politics of this. Endless imagery of people burning and looting independent businesses that were struggling to survive, and seeing the owners of these businesses beaten by mobs, cannot be good for the cause of social justice. Looting and burning businesses, and assaulting their owners, isn’t social justice, or even social protest. It’s crime. And having imagery of these crimes that highlight black involvement circulate endlessly on Fox News and on social media cannot be good for the black community. But it might yet be good for Trump.</p>
<p>And it could well kick open the door to a level of authoritarianism that many of us who have been very worried about Trump barely considered possible. It’s always seemed somewhat paranoid to me to wonder whether we’re living in Weimar Germany. I’ve had many conversations about this. I had <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-road-to-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Snyder on the podcast</a>, who’s been worrying about the prospect of tyranny in the US for several years now. I’ve known, in the abstract, that democracies can destroy themselves. But the idea that it could happen here still seemed totally outlandish to me. It doesn’t anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, what we’ve been seeing in the streets isn’t just one thing. Some people are protesting for reasons that I fully defend. They’re outraged by specific instances of police violence, like the killing of George Floyd, and they’re worried about creeping authoritarianism—which we really should be worried about now. And they’re convinced that our politics is broken, because it is broken, and they are deeply concerned that our response to the pandemic and the implosion of our economy will do nothing to address the widening inequality in our society. And they recognize that we have a President who is an incompetent, divisive, conman and a crackpot at a time when we actually need wise leadership.</p>
<p>All of that is hard to put on a sign, but it’s all worth protesting.</p>
<p>However, it seems to me that most protesters are seeing this moment exclusively through the lens of identity politics—and racial politics in particular. And some of them are even celebrating the breakdown of law and order, or at least remaining nonjudgmental about it. And you could see, in the early days of this protest, news anchors take that line, on CNN, for instance. Talking about the history of social protest, “Sometimes it has to be violent, right? What, do you think all of these protests need to be nonviolent?” Those words came out of Chris Cuomo&#8217;s mouth, and Don Lemon&#8217;s mouth. Many people have been circulating a half quote from Martin Luther King Jr. about riots being “the language of the unheard.” They’re <a href="https://youtu.be/pjYZZC5i_AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving out the part</a> where he made it clear that he believed riots harmed the cause of the black community and helped the cause of racists.</p>
<p>There are now calls to defund and even to abolish the police. This may be psychologically understandable when you’ve spent half your day on Twitter watching videos of cops beating peaceful protesters. Those videos are infuriating. And I’ll have a lot more to say about police violence in a minute. But if you think a society without cops is a society you would want to live in, you have lost your mind. Giving a monopoly on violence to the state is just about the best thing we have ever done as a species. It ranks right up there with keeping our shit out of our food. Having a police force that can deter crime, and solve crimes when they occur, and deliver violent criminals to a functioning justice system, is the necessary precondition for almost anything else of value in society.</p>
<p>We need police reform, of course. There are serious questions to ask about the culture of policing—its hiring practices, training, the militarization of so many police forces, outside oversight, how police departments deal with corruption, the way the police unions keep bad cops on the job, and yes, the problem of racist cops. But the idea that any serious person thinks we can do without the police—or that less trained and less vetted cops will magically be better than more trained and more vetted ones—this just reveals that our conversation on these topics has run completely off the rails. Yes, we should give more resources to community services. We should have psychologists or social workers make first contact with the homeless or the mentally ill. Perhaps we’re giving cops jobs they shouldn’t be doing. All of that makes sense to rethink. But the idea that what we&#8217;re witnessing now is a matter of the cops being over-resourced—that we&#8217;ve given them too much training, that we&#8217;ve made the job too attractive—so that the people we’re recruiting are of too high a quality. That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s been alarming here is that we’re seeing prominent people—in government, in media, in Hollywood, in sports—speak and act as though the breakdown of civil society, and of society itself, is a form of progress and any desire for law enforcement is itself a form of racist oppression. At one point the woman who&#8217;s running the City Council in Minneapolis, which just decided to abolish the police force, was asked by a journalist, I believe on CNN, “What do I do if someone&#8217;s breaking into my house in the middle of the night? Who do I call?” And her first response to that question was, “You need to recognize what a statement of privilege that question is.” She&#8217;s since had to walk that back, because it&#8217;s one of the most galling and embarrassing things a public official has ever said, but this is how close the Democratic Party is to sounding completely insane. You cannot say that if someone is breaking into your house, and you&#8217;re terrified, and you want a police force that can respond, that fear is a symptom of “white privilege.” This is where Democratic politics goes to die.</p>
<p>Again, what is alarming about this is that this woke analysis of the breakdown of law and order will only encourage an increasingly authoritarian response, as well as the acceptance of that response by many millions of Americans.</p>
<p>If you step back, you will notice that there is a kind of ecstasy of ideological conformity in the air. And it’s destroying institutions. It&#8217;s destroying the very institutions we rely on to get our information—universities, the press. The New York Times in recent days, seems to be preparing for a self-immolation in recent days. No one wants to say or even think anything that makes anyone uncomfortable—certainly not anyone who has more wokeness points than they do. It’s just become too dangerous. There are people <a href="https://wwos.nine.com.au/news/nba-announcer-fired-over-controversial-all-lives-matter-tweet/a9a50198-4b52-4cb7-a800-e0ffacb3302d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being fired</a> for tweeting “All Lives Matter.” #AllLivesMatter, in the current environment, is being read as a naked declaration of white supremacy. That is how weird this moment is. A soccer player on the LA Galaxy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/rowdies/2020/06/05/la-galaxy-releases-player-after-wifes-racist-and-violent-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fired</a> for something his wife tweeted…</p>
<p>Of course, there are real problems of inequality and despair at the bottom of these protests. People who have never found a secure or satisfying place in the world—or young people who fear they never will—people who have seen their economic prospects simply vanish, and people who have had painful encounters with racism and racist cops—people by the millions are now surrendering themselves to a kind of religious awakening. But like most religious awakenings, this movement is not showing itself eager to make honest contact with reality.</p>
<p>On top of that, we find extraordinarily privileged people, whatever the color of their skin—people who have been living wonderful lives in their gated communities or 5<sup>th</sup> avenue apartments—and who feel damn guilty about it—they are supporting this movement uncritically, for many reasons. Of course, they care about other people—I’m sure most of them have the same concerns about inequality that I do—but they are also supporting this movement because it promises a perfect expiation of their sins. If you have millions of dollars, and shoot botox into your face, and vacation on St. Bart’s, and you’re liberal—the easiest way to sleep at night is to be as woke as AOC and like every one of her tweets.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just with the looting, and the arson, and the violence. There are problems with these peaceful protests themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not questioning anyone’s right to protest. Even our deranged president can pay lip service to that right—which he did as the DC police were violently dispersing a peaceful protest so that he could get his picture taken in front of that church, awkwardly holding a bible, as though he had never held a book in life.</p>
<p>The problem with the protests is that they are animated, to a remarkable degree, by confusion and misinformation. And I’ll explain why I think that’s the case. And, of course, this will be controversial. Needless to say, many people will consider the color of my skin to be disqualifying here. I could have invited any number of great, black intellectuals onto the podcast to make these points for me. But that struck me as a form of cowardice. Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Coleman Hughes, Kmele Foster, these guys might not agree with everything I’m about to say, but any one of them could walk the tightrope I’m now stepping out on far more credibly than I can.</p>
<p>But, you see, that’s part of the problem. The perception that the color of a person’s skin, or even his life experience, matters for this discussion is a pernicious illusion. For the discussion we really need to have, the color of a person’s skin, and even his life experience, simply does not matter. It cannot matter. We have to break this spell that the politics of identity has cast over everything.</p>
<p>Ok…</p>
<p>As I’ve already acknowledged, there is a legacy of racism in the United States that we’re still struggling to outgrow. That is obvious. There are real racists out there. And there are ways in which racism became institutionalized long ago. Many of you will remember that during the crack epidemic the penalties for crack and powder cocaine were quite different. And this led black drug offenders to be locked up for much longer than white ones. Now, whether the motivation for that policy was consciously racist or not, I don’t know, but it was effectively racist. Nothing I’m about to say entails a denial of these sorts of facts. There just seems to be no question that boys who grow up with their fathers in prison start life with a significant strike against them. So criminal justice reform is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>And I’m not denying that many black people, perhaps most, have interactions with cops, and others in positions of power, or even random strangers, that seem unambiguously racist. Sometimes this is because they are actually in the presence of racism, and perhaps sometimes it only seems that way. I’ve had unpleasant encounters with cops, and customs officers, and TSA screeners, and bureaucrats of every kind, and even with people working in stores or restaurants. People aren’t always nice or ethical. But being white, and living in a majority white society, I’ve never had to worry about whether any of these collisions were the result of racism. And I can well imagine that in some of these situations, had I been black, I would have come away feeling that I had encountered yet another racist in the wild. So I consider myself very lucky to have gone through life not having to think about any of that. Surely that’s one form of white privilege.</p>
<p>So, nothing I’m going to say denies that we should condemn racism—whether interpersonal or institutional—and we should condemn it wherever we find it. But as a society, we simply can’t afford to find and condemn racism where it doesn’t exist. And we should be increasingly aware of the costs of doing that. The more progress we make on issues of race, the less racism there will be to find, and the more likely we’ll find ourselves chasing after its ghost.</p>
<p>The truth is, we have made considerable progress on the problem of racism in America. This isn’t 1920, and it isn’t 1960. We had a two-term black president. We have black congressmen and women. We have black mayors and black chiefs of police. There are major cities, like Detroit and Atlanta, going on their fifth or sixth consecutive black mayor. Having more and more black people in positions of real power, in what is still a majority white society, is progress on the problem of racism. And the truth is, it might not even solve the problem we’re talking about. When Freddy Gray was killed in Baltimore, virtually everyone who could have been held accountable for his death was black. The problem of police misconduct and reform is complicated, as we’re about to see. But obviously, there is more work to do on the problem of racism. And, more important, there is much more work to do to remedy the inequalities in our society that are so correlated with race, and will still be correlated with race, even after the last racist has been driven from our shores.</p>
<p>The question of how much of today’s inequality is due to existing racism—whether racist people or racist policies—is a genuinely difficult question to answer. And to answer it, we need to distinguish the past from the present.</p>
<p>Take wealth inequality, for example: The median white family has a net worth of around $170,000—these data are a couple of years old, but they’re probably pretty close to what’s true now. The median black family has a net worth of around $17,000. So we have a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/06/18/a-conversation-about-the-racial-wealth-gap-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenfold difference in median wealth</a>. (That’s the median, not the mean: Half of white families are below 170,000 and half above; half of black families are below 17,000 and half above. And we’re talking about wealth here, not income.)</p>
<p>This disparity in wealth persists even for people whose incomes are in the top 10 percent of the income distribution. For whites in the top 10 percent for income, the median net worth is $1.8 million; for blacks it’s around $350,000. There are probably many things that account for this disparity in wealth. It seems that black families that make it to the top of the income distribution fall out of it more easily than white families do. But it’s also undeniable that black families have less intergenerational wealth accumulated through inheritance.</p>
<p>How much of this is inequality due to the legacy of slavery? And how much of it is due to an ensuing century of racist policies? I’m prepared to believe quite a lot. And it strikes me as totally legitimate to think about paying reparations as a possible remedy here. Of course, one will then need to talk about reparations for the Native Americans. And then one wonders where this all ends. And what about blacks who aren’t descended from slaves, but who still suffered the consequences of racism in the US? In listening to people like <a href="https://youtu.be/FXt9Q5h1sCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McWhorter</a> and Coleman Hughes discuss this topic, I’m inclined to think that reparations is probably unworkable as a policy. But the truth is that I’m genuinely unsure about this.</p>
<p>Whatever we decide about the specific burdens of the past, we have to ask, how much of current wealth inequality is due to existing racism and to existing policies that make it harder for black families to build wealth? And the only way to get answers to those questions is to have a dispassionate discussion about facts.</p>
<p>The problem with the social activism we are now seeing—what John McWhorter has called “the new religion of anti-Racism”—is that it finds racism nearly everywhere, even where it manifestly does not exist. And this is incredibly damaging to the cause of achieving real equality in our society. It’s almost impossible to exaggerate the evil and injustice of slavery and its aftermath. But it is possible to exaggerate how much racism currently exists at an Ivy League university, or in Silicon Valley, or at the Oscars. And those exaggerations are toxic—and, perversely, they may produce more real racism. It seems to me that false claims of victimhood can diminish the social stature of any group, even a group that has a long history of real victimization.</p>
<p>The imprecision here—the bad-faith arguments, the double standards, the goal-post shifting, the <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hrFzz1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idiotic opinion pieces</a> in the New York Times, the defenestrations on social media, the general hysteria that the cult of wokeness has produced—I think this is all extremely harmful to civil society, and to effective liberal politics, and to the welfare of African Americans.</p>
<p>So, with that as preamble, let’s return to the tragic death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>As I said, I believe that any sane person who watches that video will feel that they have witnessed a totally unjustified killing. So, people of any race, are right to be horrified by what happened there. But now I want to ask a few questions, and I want us to try to consider them dispassionately. And I really want you to watch your mind while you do this. There are very likely to be few tripwires installed there, and I’m about to hit them. So just do your best to remain calm.</p>
<p>Does the killing of George Floyd prove that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>Does it even suggest that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>In other words, do we have reason to believe that, had Floyd been white, he wouldn’t have died in a similar way?</p>
<p>Do the dozen or so other videos that have emerged in recent years, of black men being killed by cops, do they prove, or even suggest, that there is an epidemic of lethal police violence directed especially at black men and that this violence is motivated by racism?</p>
<p>Most people seem to think that the answers to these questions are so obvious that to even pose them as I just did is obscene. The answer is YES, and it’s a yes that now needs to be shouted in the streets.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that if you take even 5 minutes to look at the data on crime and police violence, the answer appears to be “no,” in every case, albeit with one important caveat. I’m not talking about how the police behaved in 1970 or even 1990. But in the last 25 years, violent crime has come down significantly in the US, and so has the police use of deadly force. And as you’re about to see, the police used more deadly force against white people—both in absolute numbers, and in terms of their contribution to crime and violence in our society. But the public perception is, of course, completely different.</p>
<p>In a city like Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-12/lapd-use-of-force-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 was a 30-year low</a> for police shootings. Think about that…. Do the people who were protesting in Los Angeles, peacefully and violently, do the people who were ransacking and burning businesses by the hundreds—in many cases, businesses that will not return to their neighborhoods—do the people who caused so much damage to the city, that certain neighborhoods, ironically the neighborhoods that are disproportionately black, will take years, probably decades to recover, do the celebrities who supported them, and even bailed them out of jail—do any of these people know that 2019 was the 30-year low for police shootings in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Before I step out further over the abyss here, let me reiterate: Many of you are going to feel a visceral negative reaction to what I’m about to say. You’re not going to like the way it sounds. You’re especially not going to like the way it sounds coming from a white guy. This feeling of not liking, this feeling of outrage, this feeling of disgust—this feeling of “Sam, what the fuck is wrong with you, why are you even touching this topic?”—this feeling isn’t an argument. It isn’t, or shouldn’t be, the basis for your believing anything to be true or false about the world.</p>
<p>Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that I or anyone else needs to respect. Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that you should respect. In fact, it is something that you should be on your guard for. Perhaps more than any other property of your mind, this feeling can mislead you.</p>
<p>If you care about justice—and you absolutely should—you should care about facts and the ability to discuss them openly. Justice requires contact with reality. It simply isn’t the case—it cannot be the case—that the most pressing claims on our sense of justice need come from those who claim to be the most offended by conversation itself.</p>
<p>So, I’m going to speak the language of facts right now, in so far as we know them, all the while knowing that these facts run very much counter to most people’s assumptions. Many of the things you think you know about crime and violence in our society are almost certainly wrong. And that should matter to you.</p>
<p>So just take a moment and think this through with me.</p>
<p>How many people are killed each year in America by cops? If you don’t know, guess. See if you have any intuitions for these numbers. Because your intuitions are determining how you interpret horrific videos of the sort we saw coming out of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The answer for many years running is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 1000</a>. One thousand people are killed by cops in America each year. There are about 50 to 60 million encounters between civilians and cops each year, and <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 10 million arrests</a>. That’s down from a high of over 14 million arrests annually throughout the 1990’s. So, of the 10 million occasions where a person attracts the attention of the police, and the police decide to make an arrest, about 1000 of those people die as a result. (I’m sure a few people get killed even when no arrest was attempted, but that has to be a truly tiny number.) So, without knowing anything else about the situation, if the cops decide to arrest you, it would be reasonable to think that your chance of dying is around 1/10,000. Of course, in the United States, it’s higher than it is in other countries. So I’m not saying that this number is acceptable. But it is what it is for a reason, as we’re about to see.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few generic things I’d like to point here before we get further into the data. They should be uncontroversial.</p>
<p>First, it’s almost certainly the case that of these 1000 officer-caused deaths each year, some are entirely justified—it may even be true that most are entirely justified—and some are entirely unjustified, and some are much harder to judge. And that will be true next year. And the year after that.</p>
<p>Of the unjustified killings, there are vast differences between them. Many have nothing in common but for the fact that a cop killed someone unnecessarily. It might have been a terrible misunderstanding, or incompetence, or just bad luck, and in certain cases it could be a cop who decides to murder someone because he’s become enraged, or he’s just a psychopath. And it is certainly possible that racial bias accounts for some number of these unjustified killings.</p>
<p>Another point that should be uncontroversial—but may sound a little tone-deaf in the current environment, where we’ve inundated with videos of police violence in response to these protests. But this has to be acknowledged whenever we’re discussing this topic: Cops have a very hard job. In fact, in the current environment, they have an almost impossible job.</p>
<p>If you’re making 10 million arrests every year, some number of people will decide not to cooperate. There can be many reasons for this. A person could be mentally ill, or drunk, or on drugs. Of course, rather often the person is an actual criminal who doesn’t want to be arrested.</p>
<p>Among innocent people, and perhaps this getting more common these days, a person might feel that resisting arrest is the right thing to do, ethically or politically or as a matter of affirming his identity. After all, put yourself in his shoes, he did nothing wrong. Why are the cops arresting him? I don’t know if we have data on the numbers of people who resist arrest by race. But I can well imagine that if it’s common for African Americans to believe that the only reason they have been singled out for arrest is due to racism on the part of the police, that could lead to greater levels of non-compliance. Which seems very likely to lead to more unnecessary injury and death. This is certainly one reason why it is wise to have the racial composition of a police force mirror that of the community it’s policing. Unfortunately, there’s no evidence that this will reduce lethal violence from the side of the police. In fact, the evidence we have suggests that black and Hispanic cops are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. But it would surely change the perception of the community that racism is a likely explanation for police behavior, which itself might reduce conflict.</p>
<p>When a cop goes hands on a person in an attempt to control his movements or make an arrest, that person’s resistance poses a problem that most people don’t understand. If you haven’t studied this topic. If you don’t know what it physically takes to restrain and immobilize a non-compliant person who may be bigger and stronger than you are, and if you haven’t thought through the implications of having a gun on your belt while attempting to do that—a gun that can be grabbed and used against you, or against a member of the public—then your intuitions about what makes sense here, tactically and ethically, are very likely to be bad.</p>
<p>If you haven’t trained with firearms under stress. If you don’t know how suddenly situations can change. If you haven’t experienced how quickly another person can close the distance on you, and how little time you have to decide to draw your weapon. If you don’t know how hard it is to shoot a moving target, or even a stationary one, when your heart is beating out of your chest. You very likely have totally unreasonable ideas about what we can expect from cops in situations like these. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwWado4SVY&amp;bpctr=1592453276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbOLb0O7Pw&amp;bpctr=1592455027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_87GBOCVYTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]</p>
<p>And there is another fact that looms over all this like the angel of Death, literally: Most cops do not get the training they need. They don’t get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQLOmfx8X_E&amp;feature=emb_title">hand-to-hand training</a> they need—they don’t have good skills to subdue people without harming them. All you need to do is watch YouTube videos of botched arrests to see this. The martial arts community stands in perpetual astonishment at <a href="https://youtu.be/F4VeHOkt_o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kinds of things cops do and fail to do</a> once they start fighting with suspects. Cops also don’t get the firearms training they need. Of course, there are elite units in many police departments, but most cops do not have the training they need to do the job they’re being asked to do.</p>
<p>It is also true, no doubt, that some cops are racist bullies. And there are corrupt police departments that cover for these guys, and cover up police misconduct generally, whether it was borne of racism or not.</p>
<p>But the truth is that even if we got rid of all bad cops, which we absolutely should do, and there were only good people left, and we got all these good people the best possible training, and we gave them the best culture in which to think about their role in society, and we gave them the best methods for de-escalating potentially violent situations—which we absolutely must do—and we scrubbed all the dumb laws from our books, so that when cops were required to enforce the law, they were only risking their lives and the lives of civilians for reasons that we deem necessary and just—so the war on drugs is obviously over—even under these conditions of perfect progress, we are still guaranteed to have some number of cases each year where a cop kills a civilian in a way that is totally unjustified, and therefore tragic. Every year, there will be some number of families who will be able to say that the cops killed their son or daughter, or father or mother, or brother or sister. And videos of these killings will occasionally surface, and they will be horrific. This seems guaranteed to happen.</p>
<p>So, while we need to make all these improvements, we still need to understand that there are very likely always to going to be videos of cops doing something inexplicable, or inexplicably stupid, that results in an innocent person’s death, or a not-so-innocent person’s death. And sometimes the cop will be white and the victim will be black. We have 10 million arrests each year. And we now live in a panopticon where practically everything is videotaped.</p>
<p>I’m about to get further into the details of what we know about police violence, but I want to just put it to you now: If we’re going to let the health of race relations in this country, or the relationship between the community and the police, depend on whether we ever see a terrible video of police misconduct again, the project of healing these wounds in our society is doomed.</p>
<p>About a week into these protests I heard Van Jones on CNN say, “If we see one more video of a cop brutalizing a black man, this country could go over the edge.” He said this, not as indication of how dangerously inflamed people have become. He seemed to be saying it as an ultimatum to the police. With 10 million arrests a year, arrests that have to take place in the most highly armed society in the developed world, I hope you understand how unreasonable that ultimatum is.</p>
<p>We have to put these videos into context. And we have to acknowledge how different they are from one another. Some of them are easy to interpret. But some are quite obviously being interpreted incorrectly by most people—especially by activists. And there are a range of cases—some have video associated with them and some don’t—that are now part of a litany of anti-racist outrage, and the names of the dead are intoned as though they were all evidence of the same injustice. And yet, they are not.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XKQqgVlk0NQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Scott</a> was stopped for a broken taillight and got out of his car and tried to flee. There might have been a brief struggle over the officer’s taser, that part of the video isn’t clear. But what is clear is that he was shot in the back multiple times as he was running away. That was insane. There was zero reason for the officer to feel that his life was under threat at the point he opened fire. And for that unjustified shooting, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. I’m not sure that’s long enough. That seemed like straight-up murder.</p>
<p>The George Floyd video, while even more disturbing to watch, is harder to interpret. I don’t know anything about Derek Chauvin, the cop who knelt on his neck. It’s quite possible that he’s a terrible person who should have never been a cop. He seems to have a significant number of complaints against him—though, as far as I know, the details of those complaints haven’t been released. And he might be a racist on top of being a bad cop. Or he might be a guy who was totally in over his head and thought you could restrain someone indefinitely by keeping a knee on their neck indefinitely. I don’t know. I’m sure more facts will come out. But whoever he is, I find it very unlikely that he was intending to kill George Floyd. Think about it. He was surrounded by irate witnesses and being filmed. Unless he was aspiring to become the most notorious murderer in human history, it seems very unlikely that he was intending to commit murder in that moment. It’s possible, of course. But it doesn’t seem the likeliest explanation for his behavior.</p>
<p>What I believe we saw on that video was the result of a tragic level of negligence and poor training on the part of those cops. Or terrible recruitment—it’s possible that none of these guys should have ever been cops. I think for one of them, it was only his fourth day on the job. Just imagine that. Just imagine all things you don’t know as a new cop.  It could also be a function of bad luck in terms of Floyd’s underlying health. It’s been reported that he was complaining of being unable to breath before Chauvin pinned him with his knee. The knee on his neck might not have been the only thing that caused his death. It could have also been the weight of the other officer pinning him down.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly what happened in the cast of Eric Garner. Half the people on earth believe they witnessed a cop choke Eric Garner to death in that video. That does not appear to be what happened. When Eric Garner is saying “I can’t breathe” he’s not being choked. He’s being held down on the pavement by several officers. Being forced down on your stomach under the weight of several people can kill a person, especially someone with lung or heart disease. In the case of Eric Garner, it is absolutely clear that the cop who briefly attempted to choke him was no longer choking him. If you doubt that, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/Nql1xRtWKOU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> again.</p>
<p>And if you are recoiling now from my interpretation of these videos, you really should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_c-E_i8Q5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the killing of Tony Timpa</a>. It’s also terribly disturbing, but it removes the variable of race and it removes any implication of intent to harm on the part of the cops about as clearly as you could ask. It really is worth watching as a corrective to our natural interpretation of these other videos.</p>
<p>Tony Timpa was a white man in Dallas, who was suffering some mental health emergency and cocaine intoxication. And he actually called 911 himself. What we see is the bodycam footage from the police, which shows that he was already in handcuffs when they arrived—a security guard had cuffed him. And then the cops take over, and they restrain Timpa on the ground, by rolling him onto a stomach and putting their weight on him, very much like in the case of Eric Garner. And they keep their weight on him—one cop has a knee on his upper back, which is definitely much less aggressive than a knee on the neck—but they crush the life out of him all the same, over the course of 13 minutes. He’s not being choked. The cops are not being rough. There’s no animus between them and Timpa. It was not a hostile arrest. They clearly believe that they’re responding to a mental health emergency. But they keep him down on his belly, under their weight, and they’re cracking jokes as he loses consciousness. Now, your knowledge that he’s going to be dead by the end of this video, make their jokes seem pretty callous. But this was about as benign an imposition of force by cops as you’re going to see. The crucial insight you will have watching this video, is that the officers not only had no intent to kill Tony Timpa, they don’t take his pleading seriously because they have no doubt that what they’re doing is perfectly safe—perfectly within protocol. They’ve probably done this hundreds of times before.</p>
<p>If you watch that video—and, again, fair warning, it is disturbing—but imagine how disturbing it would have been to our society if Tony Timpa had been black. If the only thing you changed about the video was the color of Timpa’s skin, then that video would have detonated like a nuclear bomb in our society, exactly as the George Floyd video did. In fact, in one way it is worse, or would have been perceived to be worse. I mean, just imagine white cops telling jokes as they crushed the life out of a black Tony Timpa… Given the nature of our conversation about violence, given the way we perceive videos of this kind, there is no way that people would have seen that as anything other than a lynching. And yet, it would not have been a lynching.</p>
<p>Now, I obviously have no idea what was in the minds of cops in Minneapolis. And perhaps we’ll learn at trial. Perhaps a tape of Chauvin using the N-word in another context will surface, bringing in a credible allegation of racism. It seems to me that Chauvin is going to have a very hard time making sense of his actions. But most people who saw that video believe they have seen, with their own eyes, beyond any possibility of doubt, a racist cop intentionally murder an innocent man. That’s not what the video necessarily shows.</p>
<p>As I said, these videos can be hard to interpret, even while seeming very easy to interpret. And these cases, whether we have associated video or not, are very different. Michael Brown is reported to have punched a cop in the face and attempted to get his gun. As far as I know, there’s no video of that encounter. But, if true, that is an entirely different situation. If you’re attacking a cop, trying to get his gun, that is a life and death struggle that almost by definition for the cop, and it most cases justifies the use of lethal force. And honestly, it seems that no one within a thousand miles of Black Lives Matter is willing to make these distinctions. An attitude of anti-racist moral outrage is not the best lens through which to interpret evidence of police misconduct.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many videos of people getting arrested. And I’ve seen the outraged public reaction to what appears to be inappropriate use of force by the cops. One overwhelming fact that comes through is that people, whatever the color of their skin, don’t understand how to behave around cops so as to keep themselves safe. People have to stop resisting arrest. This may seem obvious, but judging from most of these videos, and from the public reaction to them, this must be a totally arcane piece of information. When a cop wants to take you into custody, you don’t get to decide whether or not you should be arrested. When a cop wants to take you into custody, for whatever reason, it’s not a negotiation. And if you turn it into a wrestling match, you’re very likely to get injured or killed.</p>
<p>This is a point I once belabored in a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/racism-and-violence-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast with Glenn Loury</a>, and it became essentially a public service announcement. And I’ve gone back and listened to those comments, and I want to repeat them here. This is something that everyone really needs to understand. And it’s something that Black Lives Matter should be teaching explicitly: If you put your hands on a cop—if you start wrestling with a cop, or grabbing him because he’s arresting your friend, or pushing him, or striking him, or using your hands in way that can possibly be interpreted as your reaching for a gun—you are likely to get shot in the United States, whatever the color of your skin.</p>
<p>As I said, when you’re with a cop, there is always a gun out in the open. And any physical struggle has to be perceived by him as a fight for the gun. A cop doesn’t know what you’re going to do if you overpower him, so he has to assume the worst. Most cops are not confident in their ability to physically control a person without shooting him—for good reason, because they’re not well trained to do that, and they’re continually confronting people who are bigger, or younger, or more athletic, or more aggressive than they are. Cops are not superheroes. They’re ordinary people with insufficient training, and once things turn physical they cannot afford to give a person who is now assaulting a police officer the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>This is something that most people seem totally confused about. If they see a video of somebody trying to punch a cop in the face and the person’s unarmed, many people think the cop should just punch back, and any use of deadly force would be totally disproportionate. But that’s not how violence works. It’s not the cop’s job to be the best bare-knuckled boxer on Earth so he doesn’t have to use his gun. A cop can’t risk getting repeatedly hit in the face and knocked out, because there’s always a gun in play. This is the cop’s perception of the world, and it’s a justifiable one, given the dynamics of human violence.</p>
<p>You might think cops shouldn’t carry guns. Why can’t we just be like England? That’s a point that can be debated. But it requires considerable thought in a country where there are over 300 million guns on the street. The United States is not England.</p>
<p>Again, really focus on what is happening when a cop is attempting to arrest a person. It’s not up to you to decide whether or not you should be arrested. Does it matter that you know you didn’t do anything wrong? No. And how could that fact be effectively communicated in the moment by your not following police commands? I’m going to ask that again: How could the fact that you’re innocent, that you’re not a threat to cop, that you’re not about to suddenly attack him or produce a weapon of your own, how could those things be effectively communicated at the moment he’s attempting to arrest you by your resisting arrest?</p>
<p>Unless you called the cops yourself, you never know what situation you’re in. If I’m walking down the street, I don’t know if the cop who is approaching me didn’t get a call that some guy who looks like Ben Stiller just committed an armed robbery. I know I didn’t do anything, but I don’t know what’s in the cop’s head. The time to find out what’s going on—the time to complain about racist cops, the time to yell at them and tell them they’re all going to get fired for their stupidity and misconduct—is after cooperating, at the police station, in the presence of a lawyer, preferably. But to not comply in the heat of the moment, when a guy with the gun is issuing commands—this raises your risk astronomically, and it’s something that most people, it seems, just do not intuitively understand, even when they’re not in the heat of the moment themselves, but just watching video of other people getting arrested.</p>
<p>Ok. End of public-service announcement.</p>
<p>The main problem with using individual cases, where black men and women have been killed by cops, to conclude that there is an epidemic of racist police violence in our society, is that you can find nearly identical cases of white suspects being killed by cops, and there are actually more of them.</p>
<p>In 2016, John McWhorter wrote a <a href="https://time.com/4404987/police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> in Time Magazine about this.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of what he wrote:</p>
<p>“The heart of the indignation over these murders is a conviction that racist bias plays a decisive part in these encounters. That has seemed plausible to me, and I have recently challenged those who disagree to present a list of white people killed within the past few years under circumstances similar to those that so enrage us in cases such as what happened to Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Walter Scott, Sam Debose, and others.”</p>
<p>So, McWhorter issued that challenge, as he said, and he was presented with the cases [<a href="https://youtu.be/EPxNUKw0kV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/VBUUx0jUKxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6KhRcIOuurI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]. But there’s no song about these people, admonishing us to say their names. And the list of white names is longer, and I don’t know any of them, other than Tony Timpa. I know the black names. In addition to the ones I just read from McWhorter’s article, I know the names of Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, and Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile, and now, of course, I know the name of George Floyd. And I’m aware of many of the details of these cases where black men and women have been killed by cops. I know the name of Breonna Taylor. I can’t name a single white person killed by cops in circumstances like these—other than Timpa—and I just read McWhorter’s article where he lists many of them.</p>
<p>So, this is also a distortion in the media. The media is not showing us videos of white people being killed by cops; activists are not demanding that they do this. I&#8217;m sure white supremacists talk about this stuff a lot, who knows? But in terms of the story we&#8217;re telling ourselves in the mainstream, we are not actually talking about the data on lethal police violence.</p>
<p>So back to the data: Again, cops kill around 1000 people every year in the United States. About 25 percent are black. About 50 percent are white. The data on police homicide are all over the place. The federal government does not have a single repository for data of this kind. But they have been pretty carefully tracked by outside sources, like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, for the last 5 years. These ratios appear stable over time. Again, many of these killings are justifiable, we’re talking about career criminals who are often armed and, in many cases, trying to kill the cops. Those aren’t the cases we’re worried about. We’re worried about the unjustifiable homicides.</p>
<p>Now, some people will think that these numbers still represent an outrageous injustice. Afterall, African Americans are only 13 percent of the population. So, at most, they should be 13 percent of the victims of police violence, not 25 percent. Any departure from the baseline population must be due to racism.</p>
<p>Ok. Well, that sounds plausible, but consider a few more facts:</p>
<p>Blacks are 13 percent of the population, but they commit <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 50 percent</a> of the murders and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883">other violent crimes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have 13 percent of the population responsible for 50 percent of the murders—and in some cities committing 2/3rds of all violent crime—what percent of police attention should it attract? I don’t know. But I’m pretty sure it’s not just 13 percent. Given that the overwhelming majority of their victims are black, I’m pretty sure that most black people wouldn’t set the dial at 13 percent either.</p>
<p>And here we arrive at the core of the problem. The story of crime in America is overwhelmingly the story of black-on-black crime. It is also, in part, a story of black-on-white crime. For more than a generation, crime in America really hasn’t been a story of much white-on-black crime. [Some listeners mistook my meaning here. I&#8217;m not denying that most violent crime is intraracial. So, it&#8217;s true that most white homicide victims are killed by white offenders. Per capita, however, the white crime rate is much lower than the black crime rate. And there is more black-on-white crime than white-on-black crime.—SH]</p>
<p>The murder rate has come down steadily since the early 1990’s, with only minor upticks. But, nationwide, blacks are still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 times more likely</a> to get murdered than whites, and in some cities their risk is double that. And <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/wiener/programs/pcj/files/PoliceandPublicDiscourseBlackonBlackViolence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 95 percent</a> of the murders are committed by members of the African American community. [While reported in 2015, these data were more than a decade old. Looking at more recent data from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI’s Uniform Crime Report</a>, the number appears to be closer to 90 percent.—SH]</p>
<p>The weekend these protests and riots were kicking off nationwide—when our entire country seemed to be tearing itself apart over a perceived epidemic of racist police violence against the black community, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-sees-18-homicides-deadliest-day-60-years/story?id=71150234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">92 people were shot, and 27 killed</a>, in Chicago alone—one city. This is almost entirely a story of black men killing members of their own community. And this is far more representative of the kind of violence that the black community needs to worry about. And, ironically, it’s clear that one remedy for this violence is, or would be, effective policing.</p>
<p>These are simply the facts of crime in our society as we best understand them. And the police have to figure out how to respond to these facts, professionally and ethically. The question is, are they doing that? And, obviously, there’s considerable doubt that they&#8217;re doing that, professionally and ethically.</p>
<p>Roland Fryer, the Harvard economist who’s work I discussed on the podcast with Glenn Loury, studied police encounters involving black and white suspects and the use of force.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> is titled, this from 2016, “An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force.”</p>
<p>Fryer is black, and he went into this research with the expectation that the data would confirm that there’s an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at black men. But he didn’t find that. However, he did find support for the suspicion that black people suffer more nonlethal violence at the hands of cops than whites do.</p>
<p>So let’s look at this.</p>
<p>The study examined data from 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida and California. Generally, Fryer found that there is 25 percent greater likelihood that the police would go hands on black suspects than white ones—cuffing them, or forcing them to ground, or using other non-lethal force.</p>
<p>Specifically, in New York City, in encounters where white and black citizens were matched for other characteristics, they found that:</p>
<p>Cops were…</p>
<ul>
<li>17 percent more likely to go hands on black suspects</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them into a wall</li>
<li>16 percent more likely to put them in handcuffs (in a situation in which they aren&#8217;t arrested)</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them to the ground</li>
<li>25 percent more likely to use pepper spray or a baton</li>
<li>19 percent more likely to draw their guns</li>
<li>24 percent more likely to point a gun at them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more or less the full continuum of violence short of using lethal force. And it seems, from the data we have, that blacks receive more of it than whites. What accounts for this disparity? Racism? Maybe. However, as I said, it’s inconvenient to note that other data suggest that black cops and Hispanic cops are more likely to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. I’m not sure how an ambient level of racism explains that.</p>
<p>Are there other explanations? Well, again, could it be that blacks are less cooperative with the police. If so, that’s worth understanding. A culture of resisting arrest would be a very bad thing to cultivate, given that the only response to such resistance is for the police to increase their use of force.</p>
<p>Whatever is true here is something we should want to understand. And it’s all too easy to see how an increased number of encounters with cops, due to their policing in the highest crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black, and an increased number of traffic stops in those neighborhoods, and an increased propensity for cops to go hands-on these suspects, with or without an arrest, for whatever reason—it’s easy to see how all of this could be the basis for a perception of racism, whether or not racism is the underlying motivation.</p>
<p>It is totally humiliating to be arrested or manhandled by a cop. And, given the level of crime in the black community, a disproportionate number of innocent black men seem guaranteed to have this experience. It’s totally understandable that this would make them bitter and mistrustful of the police. This is another vicious circle that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>But Fryer also found that black suspects are around 25 percent less likely to be shot than white suspects are. And in the most egregious situations, where officers were not first attacked, but nevertheless fired their weapons at a suspect, they were more likely to do this when the suspect was white.</p>
<p>Again, the data are incomplete. This doesn’t not cover every city in the country. And a larger study tomorrow might paint a different picture. But, as far as I know, the best data we have suggest that for, whatever reason, whites are more likely to be killed by cops once an arrest is attempted. And a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more recent study</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  by David Johnson and colleagues found similar results. And it is simply undeniable that more whites are killed by cops each year, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to their contributions to crime and violence in our society.</p>
<p>Can you hear how these facts should be grinding in that well-oiled machine of woke outrage? Our society is in serious trouble now. We are being crushed under the weight of a global pandemic and our response to it has been totally inept. On top of that, we’re being squeezed by the growing pressure of what might become a full-on economic depression. And the streets are now filled with people who imagine, on the basis of seeing some horrific videos, that there is an epidemic of racist cops murdering African Americans. Look at what this belief is doing to our politics. And these videos will keep coming. And the truth is they could probably be matched 2 for 1 with videos of white people being killed by cops. What percentage of people protesting understand that the disparity runs this way? In light of the belief that the disparity must run the other way, people are now quite happy to risk getting beaten and arrested by cops themselves, and to even loot and burn businesses. And most people and institutions are supporting this civil unrest from the sidelines, because they too imagine that cops are killing black people in extraordinary numbers. And all of this is calling forth an authoritarian response from Trump—and leading to more examples of police violence caught on video.</p>
<p>As I hope I’ve made clear, we need police reform—there’s no question about this. And some of the recent footage of the police attacking peaceful protests is outrageous. Nothing I just said should signify that I’m unaware of that. From what I’ve seen—and by the time I release this podcast, the character of all this might have changed—but, from what I’ve seen, the police were dangerously passive in the face of looting and real crime, at least in the beginning. In many cities, they just stood and watched society unravel. And then they were far too aggressive in the face of genuinely peaceful protests. This is a terrible combination. It is the worst combination. There’s no better way to increase cynicism and anger and fear, on all sides.</p>
<p>But racializing how we speak about the problem of police violence, where race isn’t actually the relevant variable—again, think of Tony Timpa— this has highly negative effects. First, it keeps us from talking about the real problems with police tactics. For instance, we had the recent case of Breonna Taylor who was killed in a so-called “no knock” raid of her home. As occasionally happens, in this carnival of moral error we call “the war on drugs,” the police had the wrong address, and they kicked in the wrong door. And they wound up killing a totally innocent woman. But this had nothing to do with race. The problem is not, as some commentators have alleged, that it’s not safe to be “sleeping while black.” The problem is that these no-knock raids are an obscenely dangerous way of enforcing despicably stupid laws. White people die under precisely these same circumstances, and very likely in greater numbers (I don’t have data specifically on no-knock raids, but we can assume that the ratio is probably conserved here).</p>
<p>Think about how crazy this policy is in a nation where gun ownership is so widespread. If someone kicks in your door in the middle of the night, and you’re a gun owner, of course you’re going to reach for your gun. That’s why you have a gun in the first place. The fact that people bearing down on you and your family out of the darkness might have yelled “police” (or might have not yelled “police”; it’s alleged in some of these cases that they don’t yell anything)—the fact that someone yells “police” isn’t necessarily convincing. Anyone can yell “police.” And, again, think of the psychology of this: If the police have the wrong house, and you know there is no reason on earth that real cops would take an interest in you, especially in the middle of the night, because you haven’t done anything (you’re not the guy running a meth lab)—and now you’re reaching for your gun in the dark—of course, someone is likely to get killed. This is not a racial issue. It’s a terrible policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process of police reform isn’t straightforward—and it is made massively more complicated by what’s happening now. Yes, we will be urging police reform in a very big way now, that much seems clear. But Roland Fryer <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also shown</a> that investigations of the cops, in a climate where viral videos and racial politics are operating, have dramatic effects, many of which are negative.</p>
<p>He studied the aftermath of the investigations into police misconduct that followed the killings Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, and Lequan McDonald, and found that, for reasons that seem pretty easy to intuit, proactive police contact with civilians decreases drastically, sometimes by as much 100 percent, once these investigations get started. This is now called “The Ferguson Effect.” The police still answer 911 calls, but they don’t investigate suspicious activity in the same way. They don’t want to wind up on YouTube. And when they alter their behavior like this, homicides go up. Fryer estimates that the effects of these few investigations translated into 1000 extra homicides, and almost 40,000 more felonies, over the next 24 months in the US. And, of course, most of the victims of those crimes were black. One shudders to imagine the size of the Ferguson effect we’re about to see nationwide… I’m sure the morale among cops has never been lower. I think it’s almost guaranteed that cops by the thousands will be leaving the force. And it will be much more difficult to recruit good people.</p>
<p>Who is going to want to be a cop now? Who could be idealist about occupying that role in society? It seems to me that the population of people who will become cops now will be more or less indistinguishable from the population of people who become prison guards. I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s a difference there, and I think we&#8217;re likely to see that difference expressed in the future. It&#8217;s a grim picture, unless we do something very creative here.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a real question about how we can reform police departments, and get rid of bad cops, without negatively impacting the performance of good cops? That’s a riddle we have to solve—or at least we have to understand what the trade-offs are here.</p>
<p>Why is all of this happening now? Police killings of civilians have gone way down. And they are rare events. They are 1/10,000 level events, if measured by arrests. 1/50-60,000 level events if measured by police encounters. And the number of unarmed people who are killed is smaller still. Around 50 last year, again, more were white than black. And not all unarmed victims are innocent. Some get killed in the act of attacking the cops.  [<a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/05/19/breaking-officer-involved-shooting-in-buckingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/officer-involved-shooting-in-adair-county-oklahoma/527-e8cdc435-dcd0-429c-962f-b2c82c22068e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article36802032.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>]</p>
<p>Again, the data don’t tell a clean story, or the whole story. I see no reason to doubt that blacks get more attention from the cops—though, honestly, given the distribution of crime in our society, I don’t know what the alternative to that would be. And once the cops get involved, blacks are more likely to get roughed up, which is bad. But, again, it simply isn’t clear that racism is the cause. And contrary to everyone’s expectations, whites seem more likely to get killed by cops. Actually, one factor seems to be that whites are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 times more likely</a> to commit “suicide by cop” (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 times more likely</a> to commit suicide generally). What’s going on there? Who knows?</p>
<p>There’s a lot we don’t understand about these data. But ask yourself, would our society seem less racist if the disparity ran the other way? Is less physical contact, but a greater likelihood of getting shot and killed a form of white privilege? Is a higher level of suicide by cop, and suicide generally, a form of white privilege? We have a problem here that, read either way, you can tell a starkly racist narrative.</p>
<p>We need ethical, professional policing, of course. But the places with the highest crime in our society need the most of it. Is there any doubt about that? In a city like Milwaukee, blacks are 12 times more likely to get murdered than whites [Not sure where I came by this number, probably a lecture or podcast. It appears the rate is closer to <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/01/12/gun-homicides-milwaukee-has-two-thirds-of-states-gun-killings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 times more likely</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/07/13/residential-segregation-associated-with-black-white-disparity-in-firearm-homicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 times more likely</a> in Wisconsin as a whole—SH], again, they are being killed by other African Americans, nearly 100 percent of the time. I think the lowest figure I’ve seen is 93 percent of the time. [As noted above, more recent data suggest that it’s closer to 90 percent]. What should the police do about this? And what are they likely to do now that our entire country has been convulsed over one horrific case of police misconduct?</p>
<p>We need to lower the temperature on this conversation, and many other conversations, and understand what is actually happening in our society.</p>
<p>But instead of doing this, we now have a whole generation of social activists who seem eager to play a game of chicken with the forces of chaos. Everything I said about the problem of inequality and the need for reform stands. But I think that what we are witnessing in our streets, and on social media, and even in the mainstream press, is a version of mass hysteria. And the next horrific video of a black person being killed by cops won’t be evidence to the contrary. And there will be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a>. There are 10 million arrests every year. There will always be another video.</p>
<p>And the media has turned these videos into a form of political pornography. And this has deranged us. We’re now unable to speak or even think about facts. The media has been poisoned by bad incentives, in this regard, and social media doubly so.</p>
<p>In the mainstream of this protest movement, it’s very common to hear that the only problem with what is happening in our streets, apart from what the cops are doing, is that some criminal behavior at the margins—a little bit of looting, a little bit of violence—has distracted us from an otherwise necessary and inspiring response to an epidemic of racism. Most people in the media have taken exactly this line. People like Anderson Cooper on CNN or the editorial page of the New York Times or public figures like President Obama or Vice President Biden. The most prominent liberal voices believe that the protests themselves make perfect moral and political sense, and that movements like Black Lives Matter are guaranteed to be on the right side of history. How could anyone who is concerned about inequality and injustice in our society see things any other way? How could anyone who isn’t himself racist not support Black Lives Matter?</p>
<p>But, of course, there’s a difference between slogans and reality. There’s a difference between the branding of a movement and its actual aims. And this can be genuinely confusing. That’s why propaganda works. For instance, many people assume there’s nothing wrong with ANTIFA, because this group of total maniacs has branded itself as “anti-fascist.” What could be wrong with being anti-fascist? Are you pro fascism?</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem with Black Lives Matter—though, happily, unlike ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter actually seems committed to peaceful protest, which is hugely important. So the problem I’m discussing is more ideological, and it’s much bigger than Black Lives Matter—though BLM is its most visible symbol of this movement. The wider issue is that we are in the midst of a public hysteria and moral panic. And it has been made possible by a near total unwillingness, particularly on the Left, among people who value their careers and their livelihoods and their reputations, and fear being hounded into oblivion online—this is nearly everyone left-of-center politically. People are simply refusing to speak honestly about the problem of race and racism in America.</p>
<p>We are making ourselves sick. We are damaging our society. And by protesting the wrong thing, even the slightly wrong thing, and unleashing an explosion of cynical criminality in the process—looting that doesn’t even have the pretense of protest—the Left is empowering Trump, whatever the polls currently show. And if we are worried about Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, as I think we really should be, this is important to understand. He recently had what looked like paramilitary troops guarding the White House. I don’t know if we found out who those guys actually were, but that was genuinely alarming. But how are Democrats calls to “abolish the police” going to play to half the country that just watched so many cities get looted? We have to vote Trump out of office and restore the integrity of our institutions. And we have to make the political case for major reforms to deal with the problem of inequality—a problem which affects the black community most of all.</p>
<p>We need police reform; we need criminal justice reform; we need tax reform; we need health care reform; we need environmental reform—we need all of these things and more. And to be just, these policies will need to reduce the inequality in our society. If we did this, African Americans would benefit, perhaps more than any other group. But it’s not at all clear that progress along these dimensions primarily entails us finding and eradicating more racism in our society.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, what would real progress on the problem of racism look like? What would utter progress look like?</p>
<p>Here’s what I think it would look like: More and more people (and ultimately all people) would care less and less (and ultimately not at all) about race. As I’ve said before in various places, skin color would become like hair color in its political and moral significance—which is to say that it would have none.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you don’t agree with that aspiration. Maybe you think that tribalism based on skin color can’t be outgrown or shouldn’t be outgrown. Well, if you think that, I’m afraid I don’t know what to say to you. It’s not that there’s nothing to say, it’s just there is so much we disagree about, morally and politically, that I don’t know where to begin. So that debate, if it can even be had, will have to be left for another time.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this conversation, I have to assume that you agree with me about the goal here, which is to say that you share the hope that there will come a time where the color of a person’s skin really doesn’t matter. What would that be like?</p>
<p>Well, how many blondes got into Harvard this year? Does anyone know? What percentage of the police in San Diego are brunette? Do we have enough red heads in senior management in our Fortune 500 companies? No one is asking these questions, and there is a reason for that. No one cares. And we are right not to care.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which people cared about hair color to the degree that we currently care—or seem to care, or imagine that others care, or allege that they secretly care—about skin color. Imagine a world in which discrimination by hair color was a thing, and it took centuries to overcome, and it remains a persistent source of private pain and public grievance throughout society, even where it no longer exists. What an insane misuse of human energy that would be. What an absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p>The analogy isn’t perfect, for a variety of reasons, but it’s good enough for us to understand what life would be like if the spell of racism and anti-racism were truly broken. The future we want is not one in which we have all become passionate anti-racists. It’s not a future in which we are forever on our guard against the slightest insult—the bad joke, the awkward compliment, the tweet that didn’t age well. We want to get to a world in which skin color and other superficial characteristics of a person become morally and politically irrelevant. And if you don’t agree with that, what did you think Martin Luther King Jr was talking about?</p>
<p>And, finally, if you’re on the Left and don’t agree with this vision of a post-racial future, please observe that the people who agree with you, the people who believe that there is no overcoming race, and that racial identity is indissoluble, and that skin color really matters and will always matter—these people are white supremacists and neo-Nazis and other total assholes. And these are also people I can’t figure out how to talk to, much less persuade.</p>
<p>So the question for the rest of us—those of us who want to build a world populated by human beings, merely—the question is, how do we get there? How does racial difference become uninteresting? Can it become uninteresting by more and more people taking a greater interest in it? Can it become uninteresting by becoming a permanent political identity? Can it become uninteresting by our having thousands of institutions whose funding (and, therefore, very survival) depends on it remaining interesting until the end of the world?</p>
<p>Can it become less significant by being granted more and more significance? By becoming a fetish, a sacred object, ringed on all sides by taboos? Can race become less significant if you can lose your reputation and even your livelihood, at any moment, by saying one wrong word about it?</p>
<p>I think these questions answer themselves. To outgrow our obsession with racial difference, we have outgrow our obsession with race. And you don’t do that by maintaining your obsession with it.</p>
<p>Now, you might agree with me about the goal and about how a post-racial society would seem, but you might disagree about the path to get there—the question of what to do next. In fact, one podcast listener wrote to me recently to say that while he accepted my notion of a post-racial future, he thinks it’s just far too soon to talk about putting racial politics behind us. He asked me to imagine just how absurd it would have been to tell Martin Luther King Jr, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, that the path beyond racism requires that he become less and less obsessed with race.</p>
<p>That seems like a fair point, but Coleman Hughes has drawn my attention to a string of MLK quotes that seem to be just as transcendent of racial identity politics as I’m hoping to be here. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1087593991976243200?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see these quotations</a> on his Twitter feed. None of those statements by King would make sense coming out of Black Lives Matter at the moment.</p>
<p>In any case, as I said, I think we are living in a very different time than Martin Luther King was. And what I see all around me is evidence of the fact that we were paying an intolerable price for confusion about racism, and social justice generally—and the importance of identity, generally—and this is happening in an environment where the path to success and power for historically disadvantaged groups isn’t generally barred by white racists who won&#8217;t vote for them, or hire them, or celebrate their achievements, or buy their products, and it isn’t generally barred by laws and policies and norms that are unfair. There is surely still some of that. But there must be less of it now than there ever was.</p>
<p>The real burden on the black community is the continued legacy of inequality—with respect to wealth, and education, and health, and social order—levels of crime, in particular, and resulting levels of incarceration, and single-parent families—and it seems very unlikely that these disparities, whatever their origin in the past, can be solved by focusing on problem of lingering racism, especially where it doesn&#8217;t exist. And the current problem of police violence seems a perfect case in point.</p>
<p>And yet now we’re inundated with messages from every well-intentioned company and organization singing from the same book of hymns. Black Lives Matter is everywhere. Of course, black lives matter. But the messaging of this movement about the reality of police violence is wrong, and it’s creating a public hysteria.</p>
<p>I just got a message from the American Association for the Advancement of Science talking about fear of the other. The quote from the email: “Left unchecked, racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of the other can enter any organization or community – and destroy the foundations upon which we must build our future.” Ok, fine. But is that really the concern in the scientific community right now, “unchecked racism, sexism, and homophobia.” Is that really what ails science in the year 2020? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you the fear of the other that does seem warranted, everywhere, right now. It&#8217;s the other who has rendered him or herself incapable of dialogue. It’s the other who will not listen to reason, who has no interest in facts, who can&#8217;t join a conversation that converges on the truth, because he knows in advance what the truth must be. We should fear the other who thinks that dogmatism and cognitive bias aren’t something to be corrected for, because they’re the very foundations of his epistemology.  We should fear the other who can&#8217;t distinguish activism from journalism or politics from science. Or worse, can make these distinctions, but refuses to. And we’re all capable of becoming this person. If only for minutes or hours at a time. And this is a bug in our operating system, not a feature. We have to continually correct for it.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking things that many of us learned when the Covid-19 pandemic was first landing on our shores, and we were weighing the pros and cons of closing the schools, was that for tens of millions of American kids, going to school represents the only guarantee of a decent meal on any given day. I’m pretty confident that most of the kids we’re talking about here aren’t white. And whatever you think about the opportunities in this country and whatever individual success stories you can call to mind, there is no question that some of us start on third base, or second base. Everyone has a lot to deal with, of course. Life is hard. But not everyone is a single mom, or single grandparent, struggling to raise kids in the inner city, all the while trying to keep them from getting murdered. The disparities in our society are absolutely heartbreaking and unacceptable. And we need to have a rational discussion about their actual causes and solutions.</p>
<p>We have to pull back from the brink here. And all we have with which to do that is conversation. And the only thing that makes conversation possible is an openness to evidence and arguments—a willingness to update one’s view of the world when better reasons are given. And that is an ongoing process, not a place we ever finally arrive.</p>
<p>Ok… Well, perhaps that was more of an exhortation than I intended, but it certainly felt like I needed to say it. I hope it was useful. And the conversations will continue on this podcast.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear Making Sense and Waking Up subscribers—</p>
<p>Those of you who have been listening to my podcast or following me on Twitter know that I’m quite worried about the emerging coronavirus pandemic. Barring some extraordinarily good luck, I believe that we have some very rough months ahead of us.

              <h2><a href="https://samharris.org/thoughts-implosion-pangburn-philosophy/">A few thoughts on the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As many of you know, the Day of Reflection conference, scheduled for November 17 in NYC, has been cancelled, and some hundreds of ticket holders are now left seeking refunds.</p>
<p>I was forced to pull out of this event <a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/1043277230632132608">nearly two months ago</a> and have said very little about it since. Now that Travis Pangburn has officially announced that he will be <a href="https://twitter.com/PangburnInspire/status/1062431248205864962">“folding” his touring company</a>, Pangburn Philosophy, I can give a brief account of what happened.</p>
<ol>
<li>I participated in 10 events organized by Pangburn Philosophy between September 2017 and July 2018. I didn’t always approve of the way those events were staged or marketed, but all of them appeared to be successful.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>However, after the cancellation of an August 2018 conference in Auckland, Pangburn seemed intent on running his business off a cliff. He owed a lot of money to several speakers at that point, in the form of unpaid fees and reimbursements. Most egregiously, he seemed less than fully committed to refunding ticket holders for the cancelled Auckland conference.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>At this point, I had two more dates on the calendar with Pangburn in 2018: a dialogue with Brian Greene in Toronto (September 5) and the Day of Reflection conference in New York (November 17). I kept my appointment in Toronto because I was contractually obligated to do so. I also didn’t want to do anything that would harm Pangburn’s ability to pay his mounting debts.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>After Toronto, however, it became clear that Pangburn could not be trusted to put his house in order. Facing a total lack of transparency, and realizing that Pangburn was using my ongoing association with him to book future speakers, I withdrew from the NYC conference on September 21 (as well as from a Vancouver conference scheduled for March 2019). Legally, I was able to do this because Pangburn was in breach of my speaking contract. Ethically, I had a far more compelling reason to back out: I couldn’t promote or participate in an event for which I believed other speakers were unlikely to get paid; nor could I continue to work with someone who still hadn’t given refunds to ticket holders for a conference that had been canceled more than a month before.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>After I withdrew from the NYC conference, my management team asked Pangburn to give us the email addresses of all ticket holders so that we could notify them that I was no longer involved with the event. Pangburn refused to provide this information. However, he assured us that he would notify everyone himself. (I do not know whether he ever did.) He then stopped responding to our emails.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>At the time I pulled out of the NYC conference, I assumed that the revenue from ticket sales was still safely in the box office and that Pangburn would be obliged to issue refunds should the conference fail. That’s how things normally work, especially at a reputable venue like Lincoln Center. It hadn’t occurred to me that New York ticketholders might suffer the same fate as those in Auckland.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>I was left with a legal and ethical puzzle that I could not solve. Again, I had no way to communicate with ticket holders directly, and discussing the chaos surrounding Pangburn on my podcast never seemed like an option. Several friends and colleagues still had events on the calendar with him, and I didn’t want to do anything to derail them. In addition, many speakers who were aware of my reasons for pulling out of the NYC conference were still signed on and seemed intent on making it work. I couldn’t see anything to do that wouldn’t risk creating further harms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Pangburn still owes several speakers (including me) an extraordinary amount of money, we were willing to participate in the NYC conference for free as recently as a few days ago, if he would have handed it over to us and stepped away. I have been told that this offer was made, and he declined it.</p>
<p>I find it appalling that so many people were needlessly harmed by the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy. I can assure you that every speaker associated with the NYC event will be much wiser when working with promoters in the future.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

<blockquote><p>PRESS RELEASE MARCH 12 2013</p>
<p>Catholic Church&#8217;s Rights to &#8220;The Work of God&#8221; Stand Trial</p>
<p>On Friday, presumably immediately after a new Pope has been elected, The Danish High Maritime &amp; Commercial Court of Denmark, will make a historical verdict upon who has the rights to use the age old philosophical &amp; theological concept of &#8220;opus dei&#8221; (The Work of God).</p>
<p>The former Pope&#8217;s personal Prelature has claimed sole rights to the concept since the 1980s, right up until it was inevitably challenged by the small Danish card game publishing house, Dema Games, when they registered (and had officially approved), their trademark: &#8220;Opus-Dei: Existence After Religion&#8221;. A name that has &#8220;everything to do with the philosophical connotations, and nothing to do with the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei&#8221; , Managing Director, Mark Rees-Andersen says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dema Games, and their Pro Bono lawyer Janne Glæsel from the prestigious Copenhagen-based law firm, Gorrissen Federspiel, has chosen to counter-sue the Prelature, which now might lose their rights to their EU-trademark, which due to EU-law, the Danish court has authority to make rulings on behalf of.  The sue was an immediate media security event.  Federspiel was last seen with a team of <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-york-city-guard-services/">event security Manhattan</a> escorting him due to this new law.  In effect, he has his own concierge security service.</p>
<p>Why the sub-division of the Catholic Church may lose their rights, is mainly due to the argument, that the Prelature&#8217;s registration was invalid from the very beginning, as no one can legally monopolize religious concepts. The church has since stepped up security and started<span style="color: #222222;"> monitoring specific or heightened terrorist threats or alerts. Since then a security team from <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration:inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-yorkfire-safety-management/">VIP Protection New York City</a> patrols the outside.  Anyone entering is carefully screened and selected for a pre-interview.</span></p>
<p>The case has been ongoing for four years, and Mark Rees-Andersen has singlehandedly successfully defended his legal rights to his game&#8217;s website in 2009, at Nominet, the authority of domain-rights issues in the UK. Dema Games remains to have ownership of the hyphenated &#8220;opus-dei&#8221; domain, in Denmark, Great Britain, France, Poland, Switzerland, and Sweden.</p>

<p>Best regards / Mvh,</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Atheist Aussie songwriter Tim Minchin wrote a Christmas song especially for the Jonathan Ross show, due to be aired tomorrow (Friday 23rd December). It&#8217;s a typically witty, off-the-wall composition which compares Jesus to Woody Allen, and several other things.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_SFdUJLebzU?fs=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Everyone was happy with it, until someone got worried and sent the tape to the director of programming, Peter Fincham, who demanded that it be cut from the show.</p>
<p>Minchin <a href="http://www.timminchin.com/2011/12/22/im-not-on-the-jonathan-ross-show/">states</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
He did this because he’s scared of the ranty, shit-stirring, right-wing press, and of the small minority of Brits who believe they have a right to go through life protected from anything that challenges them in any way.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is indeed a very disappointing decision. </p>
