<p>So what next? How should I celebrate? I&#8217;m kind of at a loss here, with my poor narrowly strictured brain turning immediately to thoughts of getting started preparing for next term, but there must be something better to do.</p>
<p>I guess I could put up our Xmas tree, but it seems a little bit pointless. We&#8217;re not doing anything for the holiday, not getting together with other family, no social events, nothing. I&#8217;m tentatively penciling in watching the <i>The Muppet Christmas Carol</i> with my wife on Xmas eve, if she approves. Is that festive enough? Because otherwise, I&#8217;m not feeling it.</p>

There, my father had an annual engagement that, to be quite frank, embarrassed the hell out of us both. In the boot of the car was a small suitcase, and inside that a tailcoat, watchchain and other faded garments. We&rsquo;d arrive soon after sundown at Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place, the final home of Charles Dickens, and within the hour, dad would be up on stage in the school hall in Victorian costume, gripping a lectern, his body pitched forward as he read to the audience his own rendering of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. We, meanwhile, slid ever deeper into our seats. <br /><br />The voices of the many characters - gnarled and guttural for Scrooge, weak and whiny for Tiny Tim - I remember well. He executed them brilliantly. I also remember the odd gushing fan who&rsquo;d greet him like a rock star once the reading finished. What I wasn&rsquo;t of course aware of was the significance of the text itself. To me, it was just a Christmas story. The characters were richer than those of your average tale, and the story had a better developed moral arc than most. But it was just another Christmas story.<br /><br />Only later did the subversive quality of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, published in December 1843, come into view. Like several of Dickens&rsquo; other works, the book electrified much of Victorian Britain. But it did so for reasons that have been largely forgotten. The origins of <em>A Christmas Carol</em> had nothing to do with Christmas; it arose from an idea Dickens had earlier in 1843 to issue a political pamphlet, &ldquo;An Appeal to the People of England on behalf of the Poor Man&rsquo;s Child&rdquo;, to protest against the exploitation of children sent to work in mines and factories. He was also exercised by the condition of children attending London&rsquo;s Ragged Schools - free institutions for the poor that had been established by charities. Should children be given so much religious instruction in circumstances where the basic needs of food, drink and clothing seemed so much more urgent to address? &ldquo;To impress them, even with the idea of God, when their own condition is so desolate, becomes a monstrous task,&rdquo; he wrote in a published letter.<br /><br />Dickens shelved his first idea of the &ldquo;Appeal&rdquo;, and decided instead to reshape it into a short story and then to link that story with Christmas. The &ldquo;Poor Man&rsquo;s Child&rdquo; became Tiny Tim; Victorian society&rsquo;s spirit of callous laissez-faire was embodied in the grasping misanthrope Ebenezer Scrooge. It was an extraordinary success: 6000 copies sold in one day.<br /><br />&ldquo;Blessings on your kind heart,&rdquo; the Scottish literary critic Francis Jeffery wrote to Dickens soon after reading the short book. &ldquo;You may be sure you have done more good by this little publication, fostered more kindly feelings, and prompted more positive acts of beneficence, than can be traced to all the pulpits and confessionals in Christendom since 1842.&rdquo;</p> <h2>A secularist Victorian bible</h2> <p><em>A Christmas Carol</em> was greeted at the time, informally at least, as something of a secularist bible - or, as Paul Davis writes, &ldquo;the first gospel in the &lsquo;secular scripture&rsquo; of Victorian fiction&rdquo;. Dickens located the story in an unnamed smog-filled Victorian city at a time when cities, according to the American critic J. Hillis Miller, were &ldquo;the literal representation of the progressive humanization of the world&hellip; The way in which many men have experienced most directly what it means to live without God in the world.&rdquo;<br /><br />That distancing from Christian worship is reflected in the book. Despite occasional mentions of &ldquo;Our Founder&rdquo;, as well as the fact that Dickens was a practising Christian himself, <em>A Christmas Carol</em> steers clear of theological evangelising. The redemption story of Scrooge is a deeply humanistic one, and as such, the book appealed to both churchgoers and agnostics. It therefore stood out at a time when obsession with Christianity was pervasive in the literary world. By the time of Dickens&rsquo; death, half of all monthly periodicals and books were religiously oriented, despite the fact that religion was waning in British society more generally as a result of the rise of evolutionary science and the historical criticism of the Bible that would come a decade or two later.<br /><br />&ldquo;I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round &ndash; apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that &ndash; as a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time,&rdquo; Scrooge&rsquo;s nephew says early on, shunting the religious origin of Christmas into a passing parenthesis and instead emphasising the humanist value and meaning of the festivity. &ldquo;The only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts, freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.&rdquo; <br /><br />I didn&rsquo;t understand, as a child, that in this Christmas tale, Dickens had nailed together the structural edifice of a broad church, one that took ownership of charity away from the pious and made it a public moral duty. His belief was that responsibility for the unfortunate should be democratised - it was everyone&rsquo;s to share. It&rsquo;s a nice thing to remember my father using Christmas to bellow this same message from the lamplit stage.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Just in case you think my <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/12/20/the-most-important-civics-lesson-they-never-taught-us/">last post</a> was too pessimistic, here&#8217;s the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/18/scientists-watch-giant-doomsday-glacier-in-antarctica-with-concern">latest news from Antarctica</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>This week, ice scientists meeting in New Orleans warned that something even more alarming was brewing on the West Antarctic ice sheet – a vast basin of ice on the Antarctic peninsula. Years of research by teams of British and American researchers showed that great cracks and fissures had opened up both on top of and underneath the Thwaites glacier, one of the biggest in the world, and it was feared that parts of it, too, may fracture and collapse possibly within five years or less.</p>
<p>Thwaites makes Larsen B look like an icicle. It is roughly 100 times larger, about the size of Britain, and contains enough water on its own to raise sea levels worldwide by more than half a metre. It contributes about 4% of annual global sea level rise and has been called the most important glacier in the world, even the “doomsday” glacier. Satellite studies show it is melting far faster than it did in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Thwaites is worrisome, but there are many other great glaciers in Antarctica also retreating, thinning and melting as the Southern Ocean warms. Many are being held back because Thwaites acts like a cork, blocking their exit to the sea. Should Thwaites fall apart, scientists believe the others would speed up, leading to the collapse of the whole ice sheet and catastrophic global sea level rises of several metres.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Thwaites glacier looks so small in the satellite view. All the white icy stuff piled up behind it looks even more ominous now.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t panic! Governments around the world are leaping into action…or not.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet just one month after Cop26 ended in Glasgow, the warning that the 300-metre thick, 50-mile wide Thwaites glacier has started to crack up has been met with silence from governments preoccupied by Covid-19 and the return of normal politics. The danger is that the many actions pledged in November to address global heating will be shelved for another year, to become just one more risk in an increasingly dangerous world.</p>
<p>Thwaites underlines that global heating and glaciers do not wait for politicians, and every year action to reduce climate emissions is delayed only accelerates global disaster.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it reassuring that no matter how dismal I sound, reality is so much worse?</p>

<p class="lead">I was this many years old before I learned this extremely important civics rule (forgive me, I&#8217;m a little slow):</p>
<p><strong>The laws don&#8217;t apply to the people on top.</strong></p>
<p>Or, rather, the laws were written by the people on top to provide them with loopholes, but also the minions who enforce the law do so at the bidding of the people on top.</p>
<p>I know, it&#8217;s obvious, and has been obvious all of my life, but as a white man I have been given enough benefits that I could overlook that aspect of reality. Events of recent years have made it so conspicuously overt that it is an unavoidable conclusion. Why do you think so many white men are rushing to join white supremacy movements, or voting Republican, or writing desperate op-eds defending the latest horrific act? It&#8217;s because they&#8217;re panicking about losing their privileged status in the inevitable upheaval. They&#8217;re shoring up the dikes, but the waters are rising fast, and they&#8217;re afraid they&#8217;ll drown in the flood.</p>
<p>There are only two possible outcomes here: either we get a total fascist crackdown to armor up the inequities of the ex-Republic, or we are going to see the <i>Ancien Régime</i> demolished for its excesses. I&#8217;d rather be on the side of the latter process.</p>
<p>What finally hammered the lesson home to me? There have been so many things. The Supreme Court has become transparently political, and I can no longer regarded it as an impartial arbiter of the law. It&#8217;s stacked. It&#8217;s rigged. It&#8217;s laws can no longer be regarded as fair and just.</p>

<p>The police…I remember when they were portrayed as Officer Friendly in PR campaigns. Nope. They are militarized enforcers for the status quo, committing murder at will. Have you noticed that the blue of the boys in blue has become progressively darker over the decades, until now it&#8217;s just black? If this were a fantasy novel, we&#8217;d call it blatant, over-the-top foreshadowing. Any day now they&#8217;re going to redesign the badges to be just silver skulls. Oh, too late &#8212; the police themselves think that would be awesomely cool.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re only just now becoming widely aware that the US Senate is an undemocratic institution that privileges wealthy landowners. I know, that&#8217;s what it was explicitly set up to be, but all we were taught is that the power was distributed among three branches so no one could dominate. Well, the judicial branch is dead, and the Senate is a place where minority views by octogenerians get total power to block legislation.</p>

<p>We still have the house, right? Nice populist institution? Forget it. The <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/pelosi-rejects-stock-trading-ban-170954629.html?fr=yhssrp_catchall">House Speaker thinks it is a branch of the &#8220;free market economy&#8221;</a>. The real reason Jimmy Stewart as Mr Smith goes to Washington is to sell out and get rich. He&#8217;s going to filibuster to make sure coal and oil companies can continue to destroy the environment.</p>

<p>We can still respect the distinguished office of the presidency, though. Ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Presidents make clowns look dignified.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-white-house-made-deliberate-efforts-undermine-covid-response-report-n1286211">we know that</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>The Trump administration engaged in “deliberate efforts” to undermine the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic for political purposes, a congressional report released Friday concludes.</p>
<p>The report, prepared by the House select subcommittee investigating the nation’s Covid response, says the White House repeatedly overruled public health and testing guidance by the nation’s top infectious disease experts and silenced officials in order to promote then-President Donald Trump&#8217;s political agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is responsible for the deaths of thousands, and further, he helped sow the seeds of conspiracy theories and bogus quack medicine that will kill thousands more. He <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/19/politics/francis-collins-trump-political-pressure-republicans/">pressured the head of the NIH to endorse hydroxychloroquine and other quackery</a> &#8212; fortunately, Collins refused (shockingly, there are some tiny specks of integrity in the political landscape, although Trump followers will probably be chanting about killing him now).</p>
<p>Trump still walks free, and is planning his next run for office. The media is eagerly awaiting the exciting, spectacular news and the frenzied PR circus that will follow along in the trail of wreckage it leaves behind. Everyone is dithering, because…because…because, well gosh, he&#8217;s the ex-president! We can&#8217;t arrest him for conspiring to overthrow the government and being so incompetent that he let citizens die for political gain! Why, if he fell, then congress would have to after their colleagues, like the rapist-enabler and the coke-snorting party boy and the incompetent conservative loony (I know, that one describes a lot of Republicans), and they won&#8217;t do that. That could disrupt the party money machine. And then, who knows, the UK might wake up to how wretchedly stupid Boris Johnson is, and the whole edifice that props up idiot privileged assholes all around the world might crumble.</p>
<p>That could lead to principled politicians taking office, and next thing you know, <em>reform</em>. The well-established money making game might get shaken up, the tables flipped, and suddenly everyone in office would have to work for a living.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve resigned myself to the fact that isn&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
<p>Hey, remember the good old days of George W. Bush, when idealists would fantasize about how his crimes and corruption and wholesale murders would culminate in him being put in handcuffs and perp-walked out of the White House? It never happened. The war criminal is in a prosperous retirement in which the media occasionally publishes a puff piece about his cheesy amateur paintings. <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a35925514/argentina-military-coup-henry-kissinger/">Henry Kissinger is still alive</a>, has a net worth of tens of millions of dollars, and still has journalists begging for interviews. Donald Trump might just be the next president of the United States. </p>
<p>Burn it all down. The American republic is a failed experiment.</p>
<p>The world will sigh with relief when we&#8217;re simultaneously hollowed out by the pandemic (facilitated by our own idiot policies) and torched by climate change, which we will do nothing about.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Former president Donald Trump disembarking from Air Force One (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2GF12N6.jpg" height="467" alt="2GF12N6" width="700" /></p> <p>It is a strange and disturbing thing to notice that after 20 years, we do not have a neat and evocative phrase that can truthfully summarise what the United States has done to the world, and to itself, since 11 September 2001. The commonplace descriptor, used by the press and politicians, has been &ldquo;The War on Terror&rdquo;. Yet this is vague and euphemistic, as it is impossible to wage war on an emotion and even more difficult to declare victory in such a conflict. <br /><br />Flushed with fervour, George Bush Jr initially wanted to describe his wartime actions as a &ldquo;crusade&rdquo;, but quickly backtracked, to the annoyance of his base. With the title of his 2011 book, the British foreign correspondent Jason Burke collected the various bombings, occupations and insurgencies under the banner of <em>The 9/11 Wars</em>, while &ldquo;The Forever War&rdquo; became popular as a means to convey the interminable emotional reality of what America&rsquo;s renewed imperium represents. Yet both of these can only encapsulate what happened on foreign soil, and not what occurred within the borders of the world&rsquo;s superpower.<br /><br />The national security journalist Spencer Ackerman has a different suggestion: &ldquo;If the United States is ever to recover from the destruction it unleashed not only on the world but on itself, and primarily on its most vulnerable, it must first understand the post-9/11 era as nothing other than a reign of terror.&rdquo; This term reconfigures &ldquo;terror&rdquo; as something that was being inflicted as much as it was being &ldquo;fought&rdquo;. Moreover, it captures the kind of power developed by the Bush administration and inherited by its successors: a sacred consensus contemptful of any challenge.<br /><br />A terse and vigorous primer on the last two decades, Ackerman&rsquo;s new book maps the political and cultural trajectory of the Reign of Terror from September 2001 and Bush&rsquo;s &ldquo;shock and awe&rdquo;, through Obama&rsquo;s attempt to craft a &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; war, up until the chaotic end of Trump&rsquo;s presidency. The actions taken in the months and years after 9/11, he writes, &ldquo;echoed the jihadism it sought to destroy: brutal, messianic, aggrieved, censorious, eschatological.&rdquo; One might also add totalising, given that every institution of the state, all wings of the armed forces, the entire political and media class, sport, literature, music, television serials, cafeteria food, cut-price trinkets, bumper stickers, the judiciary and the education system were suborned to the vagaries of a conflict designed to be endless.</p> <h2>The all-seeing power of the NSA</h2> <p>Indeed, in the founding charters of the Reign of Terror &ndash; specifically the Patriot Act, defining the legal tools available to the state, and the Authorisation for the Use of Military Force, granting the president unlimited warmaking powers &ndash; no clear enemy was ever defined. &ldquo;Precision was not something temporarily lost in the wake of [9/11],&rdquo; Ackerman notes, &ldquo;but was a fundamental obstacle to the emerging enterprise.&rdquo; With these weapons in hand, the will to dominate was alluring, and for many of its victims, inescapable. Tucker Carlson, the rightwing shock-jock, ventriloquised many when he suggested that Iraqis, who had the singular bad taste to demand the freedom of their country, ought to &ldquo;just shut the fuck up and obey&rdquo;. <br /><br />Between brief forays into the places which felt the weight of American might (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Libya, Mali and many others), Ackerman details the architecture of an internal regime of repression, roundups and the most penetrating digital panopticon ever built. Run by the NSA, the security state possessed (and still possesses) the capacity to collect any amount of information from anyone, anytime: &ldquo;the first mathematically exponential violation of constitutional rights in American history,&rdquo; as Ackerman puts it. <br /><br />This surveillance behemoth was wedded to a regimented bureaucracy of assassinations and abductions, and a shadow regime of deniable &ldquo;black sites&rdquo; with their own trained-up torturers. &ldquo;Being Muslim in public,&rdquo; Ackerman writes, &ldquo;was treated as a disreputable political act,&rdquo; courtesy of the FBI and their vast network of informants, wiretaps, dragnets and legal threats. A programme of looting shifted $6 trillion to men in uniform and their auxiliary of mercenary &ldquo;contractors&rdquo;. And where did all of those tanks and armoured trucks, helicopters and grenade launchers later resurface? On American streets, often enough, to discipline protestors.</p> <h2>9/11 and the birth of the Trump administration</h2> <p>Throughout <em>Reign of Terror</em>, Ackerman makes a point of mentioning the figures who made their names in the 2000s and would later become superstars of the rolling controversies of the Trump years: Robert Mueller, James Comey, Bill Barr, Jeff Sessions, Jim Mattis and so on. This is because the last third of Ackerman&rsquo;s book makes the case that, by galvanising the Republican right and creating an unimpeachable administration of violence bolstered by liberal complicity, the Reign of Terror &ldquo;produced&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s presidency. &ldquo;A war that never defined its enemy became an opportunity for the so-called MAGA coalition of white Americans to merge their grievances in an atmosphere of righteous emergency. That impulse unlocked a panoply of authoritarian possibilities.&rdquo; <br /><br />True, but not true enough. Missing from this analysis is the deep and morbid social crisis created by the Great Recession of 2007/08, which is under-examined in the book. Those &ldquo;grievances&rdquo; (real or imagined) were as much a product of the 9/11 era as they were the result of a class of Americans, badly hit by the economic crisis, feeling themselves to be increasingly precarious and alienated. <br /><br />Nevertheless, Ackerman shrewdly observes that at critical moments when the Reign of Terror might have been calmed down or cut back, the Democratic Party and many of its supporters moved in the opposite direction, rushing to entrench the security state. When fears grew that Trump might enact a coup or anoint himself a dictator, when the worrying about the structural stability of American democracy reached its peak, who did they appeal to for redemption? The generals, the police, the intelligence &ldquo;community&rdquo;: in short, the Reign of Terror&rsquo;s administrators who had done so much to threaten that democracy in the first instance. <br /><br />There has been no reckoning, in other words. The machinery of the Terror was passed from Trump to Joe Biden fundamentally intact. We continue to live within the grip of what Ackerman stoutly calls &ldquo;a perpetual-motion engine of death&rdquo;.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter edition 2021. </em><a href="/supportus"><span class="s2"><em>Subscribe today</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

My wife has set up multiple bird feeders, and she also sows seeds on the snow, so all day long it&#8217;s flocks of birds flitting past my office window. I&#8217;m <em>trying</em> to get these exams graded, but I get these constant visual distractions.</p>

<p>You might ask, &#8220;why not close your window shades?&#8221;. I answer that it doesn&#8217;t help, because these birds are flighty and numerous. They swoop in, peck as a mob at the seeds, and then after 10 or 15 seconds, they abruptly rise with a whooshing whirr that is quite loud and audible in my office, indoors.</p>
<p>Also, there&#8217;s a hawk that occasionally darts in for a snack and sends everyone in frantic flight, and I&#8217;d like to catch it in the act.</p>

<p class="lead">Ken Ham is very concerned about sin, and cartoon ducks, and the curse of homosexuality &#8212; more than he is concerned about the pandemic, apparently. <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/04/21/christian-sin-coronavirus-pinknews-genesis-ken-ham-ducktales-death-answers-genesis/">Pink News wrote about his fury over gay ducks appearing in the cartoon <i>Duck Tales</i></a>, prompting him to condemn gay reporters for not being more concerned about sin than COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a new Facebook post, Ham said: “A gay news source wrote an article about me with this headline: ‘Thousands of people are dying from coronavirus every day, but this Christian fundamentalist is raging over two gay cartoon ducks.&#8217;”</p>
<p>He suggested that he would have preferred the headline to be “150,000 people die each day in the world, and Ken Ham is concerned for their spiritual state and their eternity because of the raging pandemic of sin”, but added, while knowing nothing about the journalist’s religious beliefs, that they would not understand because “God of this world has blinded the eyes of those who don’t believe”. </p>
<p>He then, bizarrely, went on to speculate about the journalist’s death and whether they even cared about people dying from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ken Ham wrote: <q>Yes, the worst pandemic of all – sin – is raging about us and the death toll is 100 per cent. I predict the writer of the article about me will one day die.</q></p>
<p><q>From a perspective of a non-Christian, why do they care if people die?… If you die and that’s it and you won’t know you ever existed, why do they care about people dying?</q></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s true: Ken Ham doesn&#8217;t care much about the pandemic. From Dan Phelps: &#8220;From early in the pandemic the Ark Encounter amusement park only “suggested” the use of masks and complained bitterly about closures and Kentucky mask mandates. YouTube videos by Ark visitors indicate mask wearing is practiced by a small fraction of visitors.&#8221; So yes, he is not at all inconsistent here &#8212; he really does believe that sin is a greater worry than dying of COVID-19. He has even <a href="">claimed that viruses are a good thing for humanity</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="creationist"><p>Evolution, on the other hand, says that death has always been a part of nature. This view, found nowhere in the Bible, was actually embraced in a recent article by the editor-in-chief of Christianity Today. His belief in evolution led him to declare that it is a biological reality that “bacteria and viruses are not bitter fruits of the fall, but among the first fruits of good creation itself.” But this idea makes God the author of bad things.</p>
<p>Even in a fallen world, God remains omnipotent and perfectly capable of sustaining and protecting His fallen creation. But when Adam sinned, the world was cursed. Suffering and death entered into His creation. The whole universe now suffers from the effects of sin.</p>
<p>In the biblical worldview, viruses had an originally good purpose in creation. In fact, many viruses today are being investigated for their positive benefits, including possible symbiotic relationships and the regulating of populations of bacteria in our gut. Viruses are also used for gene therapy. Such modern-day research offers us a glimpse into the original created purpose for viruses.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/menton-116x150.jpeg" alt="" width="116" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-64934" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/menton-116x150.jpeg 116w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/menton-233x300.jpeg 233w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/12/menton.jpeg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 116px) 100vw, 116px" /></p>
<p>Cool cool cool. So what sin was David Menton guilty of, and what virtue has he acquired?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t recall, David Menton was one of Ken Ham&#8217;s pseudoscientific minions &#8212; <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/?s=menton">I&#8217;ve mentioned him a few times</a>. He&#8217;s a guy who got a Ph.D. in biology, and used it to lie for Jesus. Ken Ham has now <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/ministry-news/core-ministry/fond-farewell-david-menton/">announced that David Menton died &#8220;after a brief illness&#8221;</a>. He doesn&#8217;t say what that illness was, but the <a href="https://obituaries.mankatofreepress.com/obituary/david-menton-1084014808">newspaper obituary does</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. David Norman Menton, 83, of Petersburg, KY passed away <strong>from Covid</strong> Saturday, December 11, 2021 in Edgewood, KY. </p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. Maybe if Ham had been a bit more diligent and rational in policing all those people strolling around his &#8220;museum&#8221; and Ark Park, his <q>great friend</q> would still be alive today.</p>

Stella was a tiny eight-week-old Catahoula-Blue Heeler cross, with rich, chocolate-coloured fur, bat ears and a white bib. Stella was a highly engaging little dog, almost frantic with delight every time they entered the room, wagging her tail so hard it set her whole body a-wiggle.<br /><br />Puppies are hard work. There was toilet training, nap times, playtime and lead training. At night, Stella often whimpered until Jake went downstairs to sleep by her bed. But Stella was a quick learner too. Some commands, like &ldquo;Come&rdquo;, were easy. They just bent down and patted their knees and Stella would dash right over.<br /><br />Christina, who works as a speech-language pathologist, was struck by just how precocious her pet was. Sure, Stella was a puppy, but she was also displaying many of the pre-linguistic skills Christina looked for in her nonverbal clients: she maintained eye contact, whined for attention, dropped toys by their feet when she wanted to play, and used gestures to make requests, like pawing at her empty water bowl. Christina started noting down these milestones as she noticed them: already, at two months, Stella was exhibiting over half of the skills a nine-month-old baby might be expected to demonstrate shortly before they begin to say their first words.<br /><br />It wasn&rsquo;t the same. Christina knew that. Stella wouldn&rsquo;t keep passing milestones that would, within months, bring her miraculously into the realm of the verbal the way most infant humans are. Still, it was enough to give her pause.<br /><br />In her job, Christina works with children with developmental issues, finding ways in which they might communicate their wants through non-normative means. This field, known as &ldquo;augmented and alternative communication&rdquo;, or AAC, encompasses many tools and techniques, including sign language and facial expressions, as well as speech-generating devices of the kind used by Stephen Hawking. In AAC, there is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to communicate, no end goal for clients to aim towards; success is successful communication of intent between two parties, however that&rsquo;s achieved. Often she uses iPad apps, allowing her clients to press buttons that enunciate words or phrases on their behalf &ndash; &ldquo;More&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hungry&rdquo;, &ldquo;All done&rdquo;.</p> <h2>Human devices for canine friends</h2> <p>What she likes most about her job is that her clients often surprise both her and their parents with their hidden abilities. Suddenly, children who had seemed oblivious to much of what was going on around them would seize their device and communicate in unexpected bursts, stringing together words they had never before used or even seemed to understand. Sometimes children who seemed to have plateaued would make huge advances once their device was reprogrammed to offer a better range of vocabulary. In this way, Christina had learned never to underestimate how closely someone else might be listening, even if they seemed inattentive or used unusual body language, their verbal speech non-existent.<br /><br />Christina wondered whether Stella could learn to communicate using similar tools. Could a dog use AAC? She didn&rsquo;t see why not. One evening she found a pack of four &ldquo;recordable answer buzzers&rdquo; online &ndash; easy-press buttons intended for use during parlour games, but perfect for Stella. They were palm-sized and easily compressible by a paw or a muzzle. When triggered, each button would sound a short audio clip. Christina programmed the first button to announce &ldquo;Outside&rdquo;. It would be Stella&rsquo;s first word.<br /><br />It took a while for the penny to drop, but after three weeks of Christina and Jake pressing the button with their toe and enunciating the word before opening the door, Stella began to pay it a great deal of attention. Sometimes she would bark at the button, as if willing it to activate itself, or tensely sit by it, waiting for them to press it. Christina recognised this behaviour from the children at work: sometimes a child on the cusp of understanding would take her finger in theirs and use it to press the button on their behalf. It was a good sign: this usually happened very shortly before the child first used the device for themselves.<br /><br />Sure enough, a few nights later, Jake woke Christina. It had happened. They rushed downstairs. Stella did it again. Outside. Outside. She seemed delighted with herself, and when they opened the door in response she ran in ecstatic loops around the garden. Jake and Christina were elated.<br /><br />Since that first button push, Stella has gone on to learn around 50 words: nouns, verbs, adjectives. Christina introduced them slowly and thoughtfully, based largely on her own intuition and her experience of working with children. She also tried to offer Stella what speech-language pathologists call &ldquo;core words&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the words she would use most often. Then, as with the &ldquo;Outside&rdquo; button, she and Jake would faithfully model the new words every time a suitable situation arose. They&rsquo;d press &ldquo;Water&rdquo; right before they refilled her bowl. Or &ldquo;Play&rdquo; before, during and after a game with a toy.<br /><br />Stella&rsquo;s favourites, of course, were &ldquo;Walk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beach&rdquo;, &ldquo;Park&rdquo;. But she also had &ldquo;Help&rdquo;, &ldquo;Love you&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bye&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bed&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cat&rdquo;, &ldquo;Eat&rdquo;, &ldquo;No&rdquo;, &ldquo;Play&rdquo;, &ldquo;Want&rdquo;. Stella was curious and would press buttons to see what happened next. Christina and Jake would enact what the button suggested, and after dozens or hundreds of reinforcements, Stella learned what to expect. Christina wasn&rsquo;t sure that Stella understood the words to mean exactly what we use them to mean, but the connotations were similar. &ldquo;Love you&rdquo; became associated with cuddles, soft voices, sympathetic attention. <br /><br />Christina was working purely to satisfy her own curiosity. But Stella&rsquo;s progress was quick and caught her by surprise. In early interactions, button usage orbited around requests: &ldquo;Outside&rdquo; to go to the toilet, &ldquo;Help&rdquo; to request assistance with a lost toy. As time went on, Stella began to use the buttons in interesting ways. While watching Christina watering houseplants, she pressed &ldquo;Water&rdquo;; when emotionally charged, she tapped buttons repeatedly. She then began to combine words. &ldquo;Eat no&rdquo; one evening when they got home past her usual dinner time. Later on, &ldquo;Come outside&rdquo;. Further down the line, &ldquo;Stella want play&rdquo;.</p> <h2>The limits of a dog&rsquo;s comprehension</h2> <p>Christina isn&rsquo;t the first person to explore the limits of a pet dog&rsquo;s language comprehension. Behavioural psychologist Dr John Pilley once taught the collie Chaser the names of 1,000 toys, and later demonstrated that she understood basic grammar. But Christina&rsquo;s AAC board meant she could study not only Stella&rsquo;s comprehension but her capacity for generating language, for two-way communication. The experiment has been successful far beyond what she ever imagined. Throughout, she has documented Stella&rsquo;s progress online, via her popular Instagram account, @hunger4words, where she has amassed close to 800,000 followers, many of them pet owners keen to try Christina&rsquo;s methods for themselves.<br /><br />Among them is Alexis Devine, an artist based in Tacoma, Washington, who in 2019 bought a bouncy, bed-headed Sheepadoodle (an Old English Sheepdog crossed with a Poodle) called Bunny. She used an AAC system and also began with a simple &ldquo;outside&rdquo; button by the front door. Alexis copied Christina&rsquo;s methods. Over a six-month period she modelled new button usage before combining them into a large wooden &ldquo;keyboard&rdquo; on the floor. Soon she was contacted by Leo Trottier, a cognitive scientist and computer programmer who offered her the use of a prototype canine AAC device, which grouped buttons by type &ndash; activities, objects, places, descriptions &ndash; in a modification of the Fitzgerald Key, a system developed in the early 20th century to help deaf children structure sentences. <br /><br />Since then, Bunny&rsquo;s progress has been even faster than Stella&rsquo;s. Videos posted by Alexis, who has seven million followers on TikTok (@whataboutbunny), show more than 90 buttons arranged on neat hexagonal tiles. In one viral clip, Bunny looks in the mirror and appears to experience an existential crisis. &ldquo;Who this?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;Bunny&rdquo;, Alexis replies. Bunny then walks away and stares through the window before returning to press &ldquo;Help&rdquo;.<br /><br />Amusing as the videos are, the researchers need harder data to work from. The history of cross-species communication study has been plagued with controversy. In one famous early example, a horse called Clever Hans appeared to perform calculations on request, tapping his hoof on the ground to answer questions like, &ldquo;What is three plus four?&rdquo; Hans would perform when asked both by his owner and by strangers, but it became apparent that he was responding not to the rules of mathematics, but to his questioners&rsquo; body language: when he reached the right answer, they would relax, and he would know to stop tapping.</p> <h2>The science of talking animals</h2> <p>Clever Hans&rsquo; owner was not a fraudster &ndash; he was utterly convinced of his horse&rsquo;s genius &ndash; and Hans also took in a number of contemporary scientists. What the case demonstrates is just how difficult it can be to disentangle animal comprehension from their responses to subtle cues. &ldquo;The issues of overinterpretation (ie the human interprets the animal signals as more meaningful than they actually are) and cueing (the animal reproducing sequences acquired through extensive learning or simply responding to cues by the human rather than flexibly producing communicative sequences) have long been discussed as some of the main issues of several other animal language studies,&rdquo; explains Federico Rossano, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, San Diego. He has been studying Bunny&rsquo;s progress as part of the &ldquo;They Can Talk&rdquo; research project, which aims to apply &ldquo;a rigorous scientific approach to determine whether, and if so, how and how much non-humans are able to express themselves in language-like ways.&rdquo; Bunny is only one of 3,000 pets taking part in &ldquo;They Can Talk&rdquo;, in which Rossano, Trottier and others have been analysing the dogs&rsquo; keypad logs and the context in which the buttons are used. <br /><br />The key requirement for them to be classed as language users, in Rossano&rsquo;s opinion, is that the dogs must be able to combine and recombine the various words in different contexts &ndash; that is, not simply asking &ldquo;Where dad?&rdquo;, as Bunny has done when Alexis&rsquo; partner goes to work, but also asking &ldquo;Where mum?&rdquo; when Alexis leaves, and so on. &ldquo;If she repeats or slightly modifies sequences when she does not get a response and clearly orients towards the human while producing the button presses, it would appear more likely that she is trying to communicate something.&rdquo;<br /><br />Rossano and his team have installed five cameras in Alexis&rsquo; house to allow a constant livestream to be beamed to Rossano&rsquo;s lab. &ldquo;Having the cameras on Bunny&rsquo;s board takes some of the pressure off of me feeling like I have to personally record everything,&rdquo; explains Alexis. It also removes any suspicion that she might be selectively editing their interactions. So far, Rossano says, the data is quite convincing. The &ldquo;They Can Talk&rdquo; team is preparing to present their findings to the scientific community. It&rsquo;s important, he says, to &ldquo;retain a healthy scientific scepticism&rdquo;. Nevertheless, &ldquo;the evidence points pretty clearly towards them [the pets in the study] communicating with the humans while using these devices&rdquo;.<br /><br />Alexis too is keen to underline that she does not know exactly how much Bunny understands of their interaction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been open about the importance of scepticism, and the difficulty of avoiding implicit bias from the beginning, and thankfully I personally am not tasked with proving or disproving anything. Our journey is about curiosity, connection and exploring the depths of communication with a non-human animal, and I think that&rsquo;s pretty important regardless of the eventual scientific findings.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Shaping a dog's mind and body</h2> <p>Dog owners are not unbiased parties when it comes to assessing their own pet&rsquo;s mental abilities. This much is obvious. I&rsquo;m a dog owner, and I can tell you this for free. When dog owners speak to one another, we often expound at length upon our pets&rsquo; habits and personalities, their likes and dislikes, even their opinions or dreams. Some of these impressions may well be true. It&rsquo;s also possible, even likely, that we are wrong more often than not.<br />We project a great deal onto our wordless companions, and pride ourselves in playing a protective, even parental, role in their lives. They offer us clues as to their feelings, moods and wants, but we can never truly know what they are thinking. Maybe that&rsquo;s for the best: &ldquo;no small amount of dogs&rsquo; winsomeness is the empathy that we can attribute to them as they silently contemplate us,&rdquo; wrote the cognitive scientist Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, in <em>Inside of a Dog</em>.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the relationship between dog and human is unusually close thanks to an estimated 11,000 years of domestication. We feed them, care for them and breed them selectively for friendliness and other useful traits. We have shaped almost every attribute of their bodies and minds. They live in our homes and play important roles in many industries. In various ways, dogs have shaped us too.<br /><br />If any animal was likely to excel at communication with humans, it would be the dog. Yet until now, there has been surprisingly little study of them. Past animal communication researchers have instead opted for gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and even dolphins. But monkeys and apes, for all their human-like characteristics, are notoriously erratic, even aggressive. Dolphins, being water-based, bring myriad logistical problems. Dogs, meanwhile, are domestic companions, unusually easy to train, responsive to human commands and body language, and are often &ndash; but not invariably &ndash; keen to please. For these reasons, the Soviet space programme, unlike Nasa&rsquo;s, opted to use dogs in early rocket launches after circus trainers warned them that monkeys were too temperamental to be useful. <br /><br />Their attentiveness and intelligence is part of what makes dogs so appealing, but our love for them is also part of the reason why it&rsquo;s so difficult to lay aside scepticism. &ldquo;It is not the animals who desire to speak and cannot, I suspect; it is that we desire them to talk and cannot effect it,&rdquo; writes Horowitz. In past interviews, Horowitz has called for research to focus on dogs&rsquo; natural modes of communication and behaviour, rather on their capacity to learn or respond to ours. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s difficult not to get excited by Bunny and Stella&rsquo;s conversational prowess, and the small glimmers they offer us as to how canine minds might work.<br /><br />We may never know if the dogs are using and comprehending human language to mean exactly the same as we do. But if nothing else, it gives us a great deal of insight into our relationship with them as a species, their concerns and their personalities. As for my own dog, I haven&rsquo;t yet tried to teach her to speak. I very much want to learn her innermost desires, but I suspect she has little interest in communicating with me on my own terms. If she did, I imagine it might closely resemble the one-track conversation of scrappy Bastian, a rescued terrier in New York City (@bastianandbrews), who will scratch the relevant buttons repeatedly until their covers fly off. &ldquo;Hungry hungry hungry hungry,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;food food food food treat treat treat treat food food food.&rdquo;<br /><br />Still, who can blame him? I think I can relate.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="US coins were inscribed with 'In God We Trust' following the US Civil War (image taken from QuoteInspector.com)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/money-qi57-md.jpg" height="480" alt="money-qi57-md" width="720" /></p> <p>The First Amendment to the US Constitution prevents the government from making laws designed to regulate the establishment of any religion, or that would prohibit the free exercise of religion. Yet the US remains a decidedly "Christian" nation. Nearly all US Presidents have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/20/biden-only-second-catholic-president-but-nearly-all-have-been-christians-2/">professed</a> to follow some form of the Christian faith. Only Presidents Lincoln and Jefferson have claimed no religious affiliation. <br /><br />Historically, the sitting president's personal faith has been reflected in the overall populace. The Public Religion Research Institute <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/">notes</a> that 70 per cent of Americans identify as Christian, and 5 per cent identify with non-Christian religions. Nearly a quarter are religiously unaffiliated. <br /><br />Given the preponderance of US citizens who claim to be Christians, how is this ideal of the separation of church and state enacted within the public square? Rob Boston, Director of Communications at <a href="https://www.au.org/">Americans United</a>, a nonpartisan educational and advocacy organization dedicated to advancing the separation of religion and government, explains that while the United States operates under the separation of church and state, &ldquo;there has always been something of a carve out for what scholars call &lsquo;civil religion&rsquo; &ndash; that is, the tendency of government and political leaders to use religion (usually in a generic sense) to buttress perceived national goals.&rdquo; <br /><br />Perhaps the most explicit recent example of this came during the Trump administration. Throughout his time in office, Trump <a href="https://thehumanist.com/commentary/let-us-say-its-time-to-end-the-national-prayer-breakfast">displayed</a> a politicised version of Christianity that contained a toxic mixture of conservative white evangelicalism, prosperity gospel preaching, and Christian nationalism. His policies were not reflective of the will of the majority of Americans but instead tended to reflect his Christian nationalist policy goals. <br /><br />Upon initial glance, the Biden administration may present itself as less outwardly "religious" than Trump&rsquo;s. For instance, as <a href="https://religiondispatches.org/2021-national-prayer-breakfast-a-kinder-gentler-form-of-christian-capitalism/">reported</a> at Religion Dispatches, during the 2021 National Prayer Breakfast, President Joe Biden offered a bipartisan message of national unity and faith in light of the January 6 Capitol insurrection, with even Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-addresses-national-prayer-breakfast">highlighting</a> Biden&rsquo;s call to end &ldquo;political extremism.&rdquo; <br /><br />Yet Biden&rsquo;s endorsement by progressive faith leaders, as well as events like the virtual <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2020/09/04/biden-campaign-launches-catholic-voter-outreach-initiative">Catholics for Biden</a> voter outreach campaign and the rise of organizations like Evangelicals for Biden and The New Moral Majority point to the continued infusion of faith and politics within the US administration. It may manifest in a somewhat kinder, gentler expression, yet the ongoing problematic practice of &ldquo;civil religion", in which an administration&rsquo;s national policy agenda is influenced by its religious orientation, remains in place. </p> <h2>Politicians, prayer and "God talk"</h2> <p>For decades, American civil religion has been seen most visibly through the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual gathering of US politicians, pastors and industry leaders. Despite the fact that it is sponsored by a secretive private Christian group titled The Family (aka The Fellowship Foundation), invitations are issued on congressional letterhead and the press secure their access via the White House. Ever since President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered the inaugural address in 1953, every US president has addressed this gathering. <br /><br />During the Eisenhower era from 1953 to 1961, Christianity became identified as the country's overall civil religion. &ldquo;Under God&rdquo; became part of the Pledge of Allegiance, and &ldquo;In God We Trust&rdquo; was added to the US paper currency (and to US coins after the Civil War). Politicians regularly employ &ldquo;God talk&rdquo; in speeches, call on Americans to pray during times of crisis or uncertainty, and offer prayers before meetings of local, state, and federal governments. <br /><br />The Supreme Court of the United States has issued rulings in favour of church and state separation, including <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale">banning prayer in public schools</a> or <a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/37/bob-jones-university-v-united-states">permitting</a> the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to deny tax-exempt status to institutions whose policies are &ldquo;contrary to established public policy,&rdquo; even if those policies are based on religious beliefs. However, as Rob Boston has noted, US Courts have also ruled that certain forms of &ldquo;civil religion" are legal. This can be seen in court rulings granting individuals exemptions based on religious beliefs to, for example, the government-mandated Covid-19 <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/courts-clash-over-religious-exemptions-for-vaccine-mandates">vaccine</a>. "Given the current conservative cast of the Supreme Court, that is not likely to change anytime soon," Boston says. <br /><br />Christian pastors and leading faith-based institutions can, according to Boston, endorse candidates for public office in their private capacities. However, they are not legally allowed to use the resources of their houses of worship or faith-based nonprofit to support or oppose a political candidate, nor are they permitted to issue statements of support or opposition from the pulpit. All the same, the IRS has not, in a number of years, penalised those churches who use their pulpit for political purposes. The last <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/senator-grassley-and-the-televangelists/">attempt</a> by Congress in 2007 to force ministries to provide greater fiscal accountability failed to garner traction. <br /><br />While political candidates and elected officials can and should hear from faith communities about their concerns and views on social issues, public officials should be careful to include diverse faith and secular voices in discussions on public policy. Boston cites as one example former President Trump's creation of an Evangelical Advisory Board that was not inclusive of the full spectrum of faith and nonreligious communities in America. <br /><br />Despite now being out of the presidency, Trump's public support among white evangelicals continues to rise in part due to his ongoing support of faith-based <a href="https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/articles/why-white-evangelicals-stuck-trump">issues</a> that matter to evangelical leaders, such as abortion and religious freedom. White evangelicals in the pews also remain attracted to Republican positions on the economy, national security, and immigration. According to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">Pew Research Center</a>, 77 per cent of this demographic supported Trump in 2016, a number that increased to 84 per cent in 2020.</p> <h2>The rise of the irreligious US voting bloc</h2> <p>While these debates continue to rage, the religious composition of the US continues to grow more pluralistic. &ldquo;Nones&rdquo; &ndash; people who profess no religious affiliation - <a href="https://thehumanist.com/commentary/debunking-rise-democratic-christian-voters">represent</a> 24 per cent of US voters. As the Pew Research Center has noted, Biden's win can be attributed in part to the fact that more atheists and agnostics voted for him in 2020 than they did Hillary Clinton in 2016. <br /><br />Most politicians remain entrenched in their old patterns, and despite a 2019 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/us/no-religion-largest-group-first-time-usa-trnd/index.html">survey</a> finding that there are as many nonreligious Americans as there are Catholics or evangelicals, they continue to engage in efforts to reach the faithful in the pews. To date, neither the Democrats or Republicans have launched any significant initiatives to target the growing voting block that professes no religious affiliation. <br /><br />The US electorate is changing. It&rsquo;s time the political establishment took note and responded to the will of the people and not their faith-based funding streams.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

I was 23 at the time and working as a linkman outside the Odeon cinema in Leicester Square. Although the job had its perks &ndash; a rather fetching brown and gold uniform and regular tips from cinemagoers who needed help parking their cars &ndash; it was not an occupation that offered great hope of advancement. And, as Janet pointed out, an ability to stand upright outside a building for five hours at a time hardly qualified me for any other position.<br /><br />&ldquo;You should try for Birkbeck College,&rdquo; urged Janet. &ldquo;They take people without the usual qualifications on their evening degree courses.&rdquo; As I undid the gold buttons of my uniform that night, I did so with a new resolve.<br /><br />The application form seemed straightforward enough until I reached the final paragraph: &ldquo;State your principal hobbies.&rdquo; What hobbies? Hobbies meant collecting. And had I ever collected anything? Stamps? Not really. Butterflies? No. Early Victorian etchings? Certainly not. <br /><br />But what about bus tickets? When I was about 11, a classmate, Ken Rogers, told me a secret. Apparently if you collected a bus ticket on which all the numbers added up to 21 &ndash; say 4, 8, 7, 2 &ndash; then you could show this ticket to any girl and she would immediately grant you special favours. In Ken&rsquo;s measured words, &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be up for it.&rdquo;<br /><br />Even if Ken had been right, I could hardly expect that my Birkbeck invigilators would regard my clumsy numerical attempts to seduce third-form schoolgirls as somehow equivalent to a lifetime collecting butterflies or Commonwealth stamps.<br /><br />Neither, in all conscience, could I cite my junior school collection of birds&rsquo; eggs. That had now become a hobby that dare not speak its name. For although we had a tacit agreement that we would only take one egg from any of the nests that we raided, it was difficult to evade the charge that our concerted efforts were doing much to further the imminent extinction of the Pied Flycatcher. <br /><br />I did remember one other activity that might just pass muster as a hobby. From the age of nine I&rsquo;d assiduously racked up a complete set of Catholic indulgences. Back then a whole range of devotional activities came with a promise of relief from eternal damnation. So if you regularly attended Holy Mass on the first Friday of nine consecutive months, you were assured by serious theologians that you would evade everlasting Hell. <br /><br />Once again, however, this seemed to fall short. It was difficult to imagine a vice-chancellor, or even a registrar, admitting an applicant on the grounds that his hobby would eventually ensure eternal life in the blessed company of saints and archangels.</p> <p>It was Janet who came to the rescue. She asked her graduate friends how they had filled in their applications. Yes, they&rsquo;d all been required to state a hobby and many had opted for brass rubbing. There was a good reason. Whereas other hobbies required some basic knowledge &ndash; an ability, say, to translate the foreign words on postage stamps or to know the fine distinction between a Red Admiral and a Clouded Skipper butterfly &ndash; brass rubbing required nothing more than a sheet of tracing paper and the tomb of some long-forgotten saint in the local parish church. <br /><br />&ldquo;Brass rubbing?&rdquo; queried the Birkbeck registrar. I was ready for him. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You only need a sheet of tracing paper and the tomb of some long-forgotten saint in your local parish church.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, Mr Taylor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have not exactly impressed the panel with the news that you wish to study psychology because you are interested in other people. But, on balance, we are happy to offer you a place on the grounds that you should enjoy a great deal of fellowship with your other first-year undergraduates. None of them may have any expertise in the psychological processes of learning, memory or motivation. But to a man and a woman they are all brass rubbers. You never know, perhaps they will let you share their tracing paper!&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. </em><a href="/supportus"><span class="s2"><em>Subscribe today</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
