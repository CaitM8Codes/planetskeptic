            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">One of my colleague has a lovely compost bin in their back yard. Or should I say, &#8220;had&#8221;. They&#8217;re leaving our fair campus for a new job in the big city of Madison, which caused me some worry &#8212; not just for losing a good contributor in the science &#038; math division, but because, as <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2020/04/24/the-compost-bins-are-coming-alive/">I&#8217;ve reported before</a>, their compost bin has a magnificent colony of <i>Steatoda borealis</i> thriving inside it. Nobody ever asks, &#8220;what about the spiders?&#8221; when they leave.<br />
So Mary and I‚Ä¶ummm‚Ä¶&#8221;appropriated&#8221; the compost bin. Don&#8217;t worry, I asked permission first, and it has now been relocated to our yard. Just outside our door, where I can check on them regularly.<br />
Is it not beautiful?<br />
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4700.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4700-500x333.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-66713" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4700-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4700-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4700-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4700-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4700.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><br />
It was a disruptive process for many of the spiders. The bottom is open, so hoisting it up meant losing much of the compost inside, but we shoveled up much of it and restocked the bin. No doubt we lost some spiders in the move, but they mainly live in the tangle of webbing inside the lid, not in the compost itself. Lots of egg sacs were still there.<br />
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4728.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4728-500x333.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-66714" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4728-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4728-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4728-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4728-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4728.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><br />
And of course, many agitated spiders scurrying about on the lid.<br />
<a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4706.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4706-500x333.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-66715" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4706-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4706-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4706-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4706-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2022/05/IMG_4706.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><br />
They live on the small insects that emerge from the decaying compost, and survive the winter on the warmth of the fermenting organic matter, so I threw in some old potatoes I&#8217;d been saving for this occasion. We&#8217;ll also be much more careful to toss food waste in there, to keep the spiders happy.<br />
We&#8217;ll also rename the bin the Atkinson Home for Hungry Spiders, in honor of my colleague.<br />
Although, I don&#8217;t understand why he didn&#8217;t want to pack up such a gorgeous box full of joy to bring to his new home.</p>

<p>No, you absolute numpty. It&#8217;s the guns. European countries have a higher divorce rate than the US, and don&#8217;t have anywhere near the number of mass shootings we do. Mongolia has a lower rate, and when was the last time you read about schools getting shot up there? There isn&#8217;t even a hint of a correlation.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/stay-with-your-abusive-husband-john-macarthur-and-evangelical-patriarchy/">excellent summary of that exercise in patriarchal thinking</a>, in case you never heard of John MacArthur or The Master&#8217;s University and Seminary.</p>
<blockquote><p>See, for example, yesterday‚Äôs Houston Chronicle article, which details how for decades in the Southern Baptist Convention ‚Äúsurvivors and others who reported [sexual] abuse were ignored, disbelieved, or met with the constant refrain that the SBC could take no action . . . even if it meant convicted molesters continued in ministry.‚Äù</p>
<p>And for another example, see the recent New York Times article about a conservative pastor in Fort Smith, Arkansas who was pushed out of his pulpit because he used the acronym ‚ÄúBLM‚Äù in his blog, and because he refused to head down the QAnon rabbit hole with his congregants. </p>
<p>One of the best sources on scandal-a-minute evangelicalism is the Roys Report. Established by investigative journalist Julie Roys, the Report ‚Äúis a Christian media outlet, reporting the unvarnished truth about what‚Äôs happening in the Christian community so the church can be reformed and restored.‚Äù Determined to expose the seamy side of what she refers to as the ‚Äúevangelical industrial complex,‚Äù the intrepid, persistent, and apparently fearless Roys has done remarkable work in exposing appalling truths about evangelical luminaries and institutions such as Mark Driscoll, Ravi Zacharias, Hillsong, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Liberty University, James MacDonald and Harvest Bible Chapel, Matt Chandler and Acts 29, and Thomas White and Cedarville University (about which we also have written a great deal ‚Äì here‚Äôs one example).   </p>
<p>But near the top of Roys‚Äô investigative hit parade is John MacArthur, pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, and chancellor emeritus of The Master‚Äôs University and Seminary (TMUS). In the past 27 months, Roys has written (I think I have the count right) 47 posts on MacArthur and his institutions (not to mention additional podcasts). In these articles she has detailed MacArthur‚Äôs claims that there is no pandemic (it‚Äôs a Satanic deception, which would be news to the families of the over 1 million Americans who have died from COVID) and his church‚Äôs and schools‚Äô failure to report COVID cases; she has highlighted MacArthur‚Äôs huge salaries and wealth, blatant nepotism, and determination to keep financial details of his institutions a secret; and, she has reported accusations of plagiarism against the chancellor emeritus.</p></blockquote>
<p>On top of all that corruption, MacArthur also believes &#8220;marriage is a covenant&#8221;‚Ä¶or, in other words, marriage is a prison for women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This spring, Roys has focused on how MacArthur and his minions, taking a page out of the Southern Baptist Convention playbook, have a history of minimizing and covering up sexual abuse. Here a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://julieroys.com/macarthur-shamed-excommunicated-mother-take-back-child-abuser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MacArthur shamed, excommunicated woman for refusing to stay with child abusing husband</a> (March 08)</li>
<li><a href="https://julieroys.com/john-macarthur-church-supported-convicted-abuser-pedophile/?mc_cid=da3ab18de8&amp;mc_eid=33988b2f02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MacArthur‚Äôs church actively supported convicted pedophile while shunning his wife</a> (March 17)</li>
<li><a href="https://julieroys.com/macarthur-ministry-staff-defend-child-abuser-dismiss-pushback/?mc_cid=efac493b4c&amp;mc_eid=33988b2f02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MacArthur employees defend child abuser, dismiss ‚Äúscreeching‚Äù from survivors</a> (March 24)</li>
<li><a href="https://julieroys.com/john-macarthur-covered-up-pastor-sexual-abuse-witnesses-say/?mc_cid=5492b8d790&amp;mc_eid=33988b2f02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MacArthur covered up pastor‚Äôs sexual abuse of daughter</a> (April 19)</li>
</ul>
<p>And there is more. And all of this is in keeping with what <a href="https://julieroys.com/head-counseling-john-macarthur-school-wife-endure-abuse/?mc_cid=32ca3ab5b6&amp;mc_eid=33988b2f02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Street, chair of the graduate program in biblical counseling at TMUS, has taught his students</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Christian wife should endure abuse by a non-Christian husband in the same way that missionaries endure persecution.</li>
<li>By enduring abuse a wife may win her husband to Christ.</li>
<li>When both spouses are Christian, the wife should rely on church processes, as government authorities must be the absolute last resort.</li>
<li>Domestic violence shelters are terrible places, as they teach women to be assertive.</li>
<li>The only grounds for divorce are unrepentant adultery and abandonment.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I watched my grandmother suffer for years in an abusive, broken marriage, and I don&#8217;t think she ever tried to get out of it. I think the last decades of her life would have been much happier if she could have escaped, although it probably would have accelerated my grandfather&#8217;s decline.</p>

<p class="lead">Hey! Remember these hot news stories?</p>
<ul>
<li>The COVID pandemic? It&#8217;s still going on! We&#8217;ve got <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/05/28/covid-memorial-day-surge/">five times the number of new infections as this same time last year</a>. No one cares.</li>
<li>The war in Ukraine? There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/29/russia-ukraine-war-battle-in-donbas-indescribably-difficult-says-zelenskiy-live">even more shelling of civilians now</a>! No one cares. </li>
<li>School shootings? Give it a week, we&#8217;ll stop caring about those, too. In a week, there will probably be a couple more, and we won&#8217;t even notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably some other major events, but I forgot them.</p>
<p>Can an entire country, or possibly an entire species, come down with acute Alzheimer&#8217;s disease?</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="A still from &quot;Station Eleven&quot;" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/StationEleven.jpeg" height="1067" alt="A still from 'Station Eleven'" width="1600" /></p> <p class="p1">In March 2020, it felt like those of us who were lucky enough to be able to lock down in our homes and watch a lot of television were quickly sorted into two opposing camps. There were those who sought out a total escape from the daily accumulation of death tolls. Absurdist documentaries like Netflix&rsquo;s <em>Tiger King</em> and endless dating reality shows were this group&rsquo;s binging material. But alongside them co-existed the people who wanted to immerse themselves in fictional versions of their current situation, rather than look away. Pandemic-based films like <em>Contagion</em>, <em>28 Days Later</em>, <em>Outbreak</em> and others provided this hit of schadenfreude, filling our screens with safely contained versions of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; even as a real-life virus raged through our communities.</p> <p class="p3">These, and indeed many other conventional disaster movies, follow a simple narrative template. The viewer is introduced to the central characters before The Event that will utterly change their lives, either in early scenes or via flashbacks to life before. Initially, the warning signs of the cataclysm are ignored by many, until it is too late to prevent the inevitable. Transmission of the virus surges exponentially, millions die, and our remaining heroes are left to make the best of the life that remains to them in the post-apocalyptic landscape. Invariably, human life finds a way to endure, albeit in much altered and reduced circumstances. To put it another way: it is extremely rare for a mainstream pandemic thriller to end with the camera panning over an empty planet heaped with corpses.</p> <h2 class="p3">"Station Eleven" and breaking new ground</h2> <p class="p3">There is something gratifying about the rhythms of this basic story. It takes a terrifying, incomprehensible unknown and slots it into a familiar structure with a beginning, middle and end. But having now lived through two years and counting of a major viral pandemic, we know that such an event is anything but neat and compartmentalised. Imaginary pandemics will forever hit differently for us, now we have first-hand experience of the chaos such a situation can create in the lives of even the luckiest survivor. With this knowledge has come an appetite for a different kind of on-screen pandemic &ndash; something that reflects the true complexities of life with a deadly virus and resists the easy categorisation of everyone as either &ldquo;victim&rdquo; or &ldquo;survivor&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">The best example of this new wave of fictional pandemics was, surprisingly, imagined long before the SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2 virus was first identified. Emily St John Mandel&rsquo;s novel <em>Station Eleven </em>was published in 2014 and follows a group of travelling players touring the Great Lakes region of North America 20 years after a virulent strain of swine flu has wiped out most of the population. Although critically acclaimed from the start, it wasn&rsquo;t until 2020 that the book went stratospheric, selling hundreds of thousands of copies.</p> <p class="p3">A film adaptation had been in the works since 2015, but in late 2019 this was revealed to have been transformed into a television series for the HBO Max streaming service. By the time the show aired in 2021, the world had been altered irrevocably by events that bore an uncanny similarity to those of the plot.</p> <p class="p3">Yet <em>Station Eleven</em> is worth watching regardless of its coincidental mirroring of reality. Mandel&rsquo;s story, unlike some of the big-budget pandemic thrillers that scratched that early itch for manageable terror, is small in scale. It focuses tightly on the creative and emotional lives of her main characters. As is the case with real people, their past relationships and traumas inform their present-day behaviour far more than the big-picture facts about a flu virus. The virus intrudes only insofar as it is relevant to their daily existence. There are no forced flashbacks showing what the US president was doing the moment that the virus hit, or dramatic scenes where epidemiologists summarise the worldwide prognosis.</p> <p class="p3">The show is emotional and dark in places, but it is also, audaciously, uplifting. Hinting that people who have suffered through horrible things can also sometimes enjoy the life they still have feels daring, almost taboo, but at our current moment it is deeply satisfying."</p> <h2 class="p3">"Sweet Tooth" and "Creamery": a new breed of story?</h2> <p class="p3"><em>Sweet Tooth,</em> a 2021 adaptation of a comic book of the same name, uses whimsy and fantasy to achieve a similarly broad emotional range. In this scenario, society has ten years prior experienced &ldquo;the Great Crumble&rdquo;, because of a pandemic known only as &ldquo;the Sick&rdquo;. As a result, most of the world&rsquo;s humans were killed and human-animal hybrid babies emerged. Gus, a half-deer half-child, has been left alone in the woods after the death of his father. He thus sets out on his own at the age of ten to find his absent mother.</p> <p class="p3">The show is visually gorgeous, setting this cute antlered child in a series of sweeping forest landscapes. The beauty all around him contrasts with Gus&rsquo;s ambient fear. He is being hunted by a band of humans known as &ldquo;the Last Men&rdquo;, who fear that these hybrid children were the cause, rather than the result, of the pandemic. The Sick not only killed people, it also destroyed the survivors&rsquo; ability to interact without suspicion. As a portrayal of a pandemic&rsquo;s ripple effect, it is potent.</p> <p class="p5">Seriousness is another boundary that creators of post-Covid pandemics are beginning to push. Contagion and death are not traditionally fertile grounds for comedy, but choosing to laugh at horrible things can sometimes tease out greater nuance than a purely po-faced treatment. This is definitely the case in <em>Creamerie</em>, a late 2021 comedy-horror show from New Zealand that follows a trio of women running a dairy farm eight years after a viral pandemic has wiped out most of the world&rsquo;s men. Although free of the patriarchal dynamics that govern other post-apocalyptic fertility-orientated stories such as <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em>, the working women of <em>Creamerie</em> still find themselves oppressed by a fascist authority. But this one is run by authoritarian women and uses &ldquo;wellness&rdquo; practices to achieve its ends. Part black comedy, part satire, part crime caper, it can feel unsettling at first to laugh at the show&rsquo;s jabs at wellness mantras alongside flashbacks to the gory pyres of male corpses. But when the women discover a man who has survived the extermination and decide to help him evade capture by the sperm-obsessed wellness authorities, the emotional stakes are raised.</p> <p class="p3">Bobby, played by a former <em>Neighbours</em> star, needs their generosity and courage to survive, even if he is physically stronger than the women in authority. The mixture of camaraderie, jadedness and hope exhibited by the central characters is recognisable. In amongst the dirty jokes and Gwyneth Paltrow-esque platitudes &ndash; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an &lsquo;us&rsquo; in every uterus!&rdquo; they chant at one point &ndash; is a familiar tale about power and who gets to wield it in difficult times.</p> <p class="p3">All three of these post-Covid pandemic portrayals are set years after the initial outbreak. One of the overriding lessons of the last two years has been that pandemics don&rsquo;t end as neatly as the classic disaster film might have once led us to believe. Rather than being short and sharp, this is a calamity that unfolds slowly, intertwining with our existing lives, rather than blotting them out in one convenient detonation. It&rsquo;s no wonder that we now prefer pandemic dramas that engage with the myriad ways in which these creeping tendrils of fear can change us and how we live &ndash; for the worse, of course, but also for the better.</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/freedom.jpg" height="359" alt="'Freedom' by Raymond Tallis" width="239" /></p> <p class="p1">"All theory is against free will; all experience for it.&rdquo; So said Dr Johnson, in his famous formulation. Which, then, should we follow: theory or experience? Is it our responsibility to follow the inexorable logic of theories wherever they might lead, even if they deny us the reality of our freedom? Or do we take as our guide the practical knowledge that for anything we do to be meaningfully ours at all, it must have been chosen freely? Both options are open to the philosopher, and both suggest not only different pre-theoretical commitments, but different conceptions of what philosophy might help us do with our freedom.</p> <p class="p3">The theoretical arguments against free will are familiar. The natural world is governed by exceptionless and immutable laws. Everything we do is an effect of causes outside of our control, so even when we think we are choosing between alternative futures, there is in truth no way we could have done otherwise, and therefore no meaningful sense in which we are free. All said, we are nothing but a conduit for natural forces: we never act, things only happen to us.</p> <p class="p3">This possibility terrified Immanuel Kant. Like many before and since, Kant saw a deterministic universe as a kind of desert, bereft of anything that could make human life meaningful. Without free will there is no morality, no taking responsibility for our own life or the lives of others. The task of philosophy is to show a way out of this uninhabitable desert, to show how free will is possible.</p> <p class="p3">This was not the only response to determinism. Spinoza asks us to consider a stone falling from the sky. Were we to ask the stone, Spinoza suggests, it would claim that it moves of its own accord, and could just as well decide to change direction if it pleased. Human freedom, he argues, like that of the stone, consists solely in our being conscious of our desires yet ignorant of their causes. Stubbornly clinging to our intuitions of freedom even where they contradict rational thought is a kind of betrayal, an abdication of philosophical responsibility. The purpose of philosophy is not to find space for freedom &ndash; there is none &ndash; but rather to conceive what a meaningful human life might look like given its absence.</p> <h2 class="p3">Free will and science: a reconciliation?</h2> <p class="p3">The very title of Raymond Tallis&rsquo;s new book tells us where he stands. <em>Freedom: An Impossible Reality</em> &ndash; impossible according to theory, and yet affirmed by our every action. For Tallis, the experience of freedom is non-negotiable: we cannot but experience ourselves as choosing and deciding, intervening in the world in ways that make a difference to it. Beginning from the reality of this experience, Tallis argues that where our theories appear to contradict free will, it is a sign we have misinterpreted them. Scientific theories, far from providing arguments against free will, are powerful evidence for its existence.</p> <p class="p3">Tallis is a philosopher, but he also spent much of his career as a clinical neuroscientist. Early on in the book, he takes on the concept of &ldquo;neurodeterminism&rdquo;, according to which it is not us but the neurochemistry of our brains that really calls the shots in human agency. Everything we do, according to this theory, is pre-determined by the firings of neurons in our brain, as is supposedly demonstrated by the famous experiments of Benjamin Libet, in which certain neurons are seen to fire in advance of the self-reported taking of a &ldquo;decision&rdquo; (whatever that is supposed to mean, neuroscientifically speaking). Tallis presents a convincing argument that such interpretations tend to turn good science into bad philosophy.</p> <p class="p5">The most original part of Tallis&rsquo;s argument is his account of causation. Determinism relies on the idea of causal necessity: the earthquake in the ocean bed causes a chain of events that necessarily leads to the tsunami crashing on the coast. But, Tallis argues, causal necessity is not at all inherent in nature. David Hume famously claimed that the &ldquo;necessary connection&rdquo; between cause and effect is formed in the mind, and Tallis pushes the argument further, arguing not only that the necessary connection between cause and effect is forged in the mind, but that what we call &ldquo;causes&rdquo; and &ldquo;effects&rdquo; are themselves mind-dependent, picked out from a fundamentally undifferentiated nature for pragmatic purposes. If causes and effects are not building blocks of reality, but useful tools that are simply assigned that status for explanatory purposes, it makes little sense to think of ourselves as constrained by them. Causation is not something outside us that limits our freedom, but an expression of the free and creative choices we make in constructing scientific theories.</p> <p class="p3">This brings us to Tallis&rsquo;s controversial claim of the &ldquo;unnaturalness of natural science&rdquo;: the claim that the very practice of experimental science demonstrates our freedom, because it shows that in an important sense, we stand outside of nature. Nature, left to its own devices, has certain habits; there are patterns and regularities to its behaviour. But for these &ldquo;habits of nature&rdquo; to become &ldquo;laws of science&rdquo;, there must be conscious subjects to discover and elaborate these laws &ndash; there must be something which &ldquo;stands outside&rdquo; nature, holding a mirror up to it.</p> <h2 class="p4">The importance of "intentionality"</h2> <p class="p3">What allows us to stand outside the laws of nature, Tallis argues, is &ldquo;intentionality&rdquo;, the relation between a mind and a world by virtue of which thoughts can be <em>about </em>anything at all. He argues that this is a property unique to human subjects: earthquakes <em>are</em>, but they are not <em>about</em> anything. The thoughts of seismologists, on the other hand, are quite frequently about earthquakes. It is this aboutness that &ldquo;opens up a distance&rdquo;, what Tallis calls the &ldquo;virtual distance created by intentionality&rdquo;. This distance allows the scientist to observe the world, to carve events into &ldquo;causes&rdquo; and &ldquo;effects&rdquo; for his own purposes, and to open up a space of possibility outside of that which actually exists. Crucially, the intentionality that allows for action and for the scientific gaze cannot itself be explained scientifically: &ldquo;telereception explains how the light gets in, but not how a gaze looks out.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p5">If this sounds less razor-sharp than the earlier critiques, it is. Tallis does not suffer from the inhibition of academic philosophers, or share the restraint of their conclusions. This makes for an invigorating treatise, especially in the critical sections, and it is perhaps natural that Tallis is more convincing arguing against determinism than for free will. If free will just <em>is</em>, then Tallis&rsquo;s task is to rid those overly enamoured of scientific materialism of the strange delusions that lead them to deny manifest reality.</p> <p class="p3">But which is the delusion? Denying the experience of freedom affirmed by our every action, or insisting, like Spinoza&rsquo;s stone, that in spite of everything we know, we are free, for no other reason than we feel we must be? One final response suggests itself: a shrug of the shoulders. Being <em>truly, really, metaphysically</em> free might mean very little to me. Whether or not I am truly free, I still have to get out of bed in the morning. I still make plans for the future, hope for their success and risk disappointment if they fail. Does any of this depend on my being radically free? Would any of it be compromised if I was but a conduit for natural forces? If not, if I were to go about my life the same way in either case, then the distinction between free will and determinism, in which so much of our humanity appears to be at stake, can come to seem a difference that makes no difference at all.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="The family of Henrietta Lacks at the launch of her statue in Bristol, 2021" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/2GX5HP9.jpg" height="1066" alt="The family of Henrietta Lacks at the launch of her statue in Bristol" width="1600" /></p> <p class="p1">When Johns Hopkins Hospital held a press conference in 1951 announcing its discovery of the HeLa cell line, the body of Henrietta Lacks was still lying in the hospital&rsquo;s morgue. She had died of cervical cancer at the age of 31, leaving behind a husband and five children. Johns Hopkins took time to excitedly inform the world of a great medical advancement: these were the first human cells able to grow outside a body for more than 36 hours, opening up new paths for research. But they never told her grieving family.</p> <p class="p3">It was only in 1975 that the family discovered the fate of the cells, which had been harvested from tumours in Henrietta&rsquo;s womb. Scientists hoping to map Henrietta&rsquo;s DNA called her husband in order to request permission to collect genetic samples from him and other relatives. Before that phone call, no efforts had been made to seek consent or inform the family. They tried to find out more, but the details were scarce. &ldquo;She was systematically erased by Johns Hopkins, scientists, researchers and doctors &ndash; often incorrectly referred to as &lsquo;Helen Lane&rsquo; or &lsquo;Henry Lawson&rsquo;,&rdquo; Alfred Lacks Carter, Henrietta&rsquo;s grandson, said.</p> <p class="p3">The cells, which are remarkably durable and prolific, thriving in lab conditions, have since been reproduced billions of times. The HeLa cell line has facilitated crucial research on viruses such as polio, zika, HIV, herpes and measles. Recently, it played an important role in the development of Covid-19 vaccines.</p> <p class="p3">On 4 October, exactly 70 years since the day Henrietta died, the Lacks family estate filed a lawsuit against biotech giant Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, one of the many companies making use of the HeLa cell line. Represented by civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who has fought for the rights of police brutality victims including Trayvon Martin and George Floyd, and Christopher Seeger, who led the $1 billion National Football League concussion settlement, the suit accuses the company of selling HeLa cells without consent in a &ldquo;racially unjust medical system&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">For the family, the lawsuit is part of a long fight to have Henrietta&rsquo;s mistreatment recognised. <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> (2017), an HBO film starring Oprah Winfrey, based on Rebecca Skoolt&rsquo;s 2010 book of the same title, initially helped draw mainstream attention to the Lacks story and the impact of HeLa cells. Seeger and Crump were drawn to the case partly due to its historical significance. They now plan to investigate at least 100 other pharmaceutical companies for their use of the cells.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;The continued exploitation of Mrs. Lacks&rsquo; genetic material is one of the greatest examples of corporate theft in history,&rdquo; Seeger said. &ldquo;Her story represents the unfortunately common exploitation of Black people by the medical industry throughout US history. When I learned about this case, I wanted to be a part of correcting that wrong, even if only for one family.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">The doctrine of unjust enrichment</h2> <p class="p5">Over 50 million metric tonnes of HeLa cells have been distributed around the world to date, while the cells have been involved in nearly 75,000 studies. Widely considered the industry standard tool for studying human biology, they have contributed to the development of drugs for HIV/Aids and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, as well as breakthroughs in reproductive health and research on chromosomal conditions, gene-mapping and precision medicine. As Carter, Henrietta&rsquo;s grandson, has said: &ldquo;Billions of dollars [are] being made without our consent.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Should the Lacks family be compensated &ndash; and if so, how? This past October, Crump told Amy Goodman of <em>Democracy Now! </em>that the lawsuit is based &ldquo;on the principle of not just simple justice, not just social justice,&rdquo; but &ldquo;genetic justice &ndash; the belief that justice should flow from one generation to the next.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Genetic justice recognises how past violations of disenfranchised communities have shaped science and medical education around the world. But will it hold up in a court of law? Experts in bioethics or law may simply counter that while informed consent matters, &ldquo;genetic justice&rdquo; is not a recognised legal theory. However, it is related to the doctrine of Unjust Enrichment, which occurs when one person is enriched at the expense of another in circumstances that the law sees as unjust.</p> <p class="p3">Crump believes that the doctrine of Unjust Enrichment applies to this case. As he put it in the interview, &ldquo;You should not be allowed to continue to benefit at the peril of the victim, which is Henrietta Lacks.&rdquo; Seeger, meanwhile, has claimed that &ldquo;research organisations and pharmaceutical companies are making a conscious choice to embrace the legacy of racial injustice embedded in the US research and medical systems.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">It is difficult, however, to provide concrete evidence of racial injustice. Its role in Henrietta Lack&rsquo;s mistreatment is a point of legal dispute in the case. Back in the 1950s, there were no clear ethical standards for any patient, regardless of race, when it came to medical research. It was <br />common practice for biospecimens to be taken or analysed by doctors and researchers without their consent. Meanwhile, official health data related to race from the period is thin on the ground. However, it&rsquo;s important to look at the big picture.</p> <h2 class="p4">Medical ethics and the question of profit</h2> <p class="p5">Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 in Virginia, at a time when the Jim Crow laws enforced racial segregation in most areas of life. Her mother died when Lacks was aged four, and she was sent to live with her grandfather in a log cabin on a tobacco farm that once housed slaves. Her cancer diagnosis came in early 1951, following her marriage to Daniel &ldquo;Day&rdquo; Lacks and the birth of her five children. She was sent to Baltimore for treatment but her options were limited. Most hospitals refused to take Black patients. Only teaching hospitals, like Johns Hopkins, had segregated wards.</p> <p class="p3">Lacks died on such a ward. In the eight months before her death, doctors had been taking biopsies of her rapidly reproducing cancerous cells. Dr George Gey, a cell biologist and prominent cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins, created the HeLa cell line and sent it to a special facility at the Tuskegee Institute without patient knowledge or family consent, in order to manufacture more HeLa cells and distribute them worldwide.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;My great-grandmother experienced medical racism,&rdquo; said Victoria Baptiste, &ldquo;and my family faced discrimination.&rdquo; This pattern, she says, has continued. &ldquo;Today, we [the family] speak out against normalised malpractice and structural gaslighting to demand that historical injustices are acknowledged and addressed as the first step to building trust in research, science and medicine.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Johns Hopkins Hospital, however, denies targeting Black patients. &ldquo;It was common practice at Johns Hopkins to collect tissue samples from cervical cancer patients, regardless of race or socio-economic status,&rdquo; it has stated on a special legacy site, devoted to clarifying their stance on the case. The hospital has admitted that it should have done more in the past to inform the Lacks family. However, it has emphasised that it has only ever &ldquo;offered&rdquo; HeLa cells for scientific research, not sold them.</p> <p class="p3">But while the hospital may not have profited, its extraction of the cells has meant that others have. There are approximately 11,000 registered patents around the world using HeLa cells, owned by multiple companies. One of these is Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. In the case brought by the Lacks family, the company has been accused of profiting directly from the mass production of Lacks&rsquo; cell tissue. It has also marketed at least 12 products, sold to labs across the globe, that contain the HeLa cell line.</p> <p class="p3">This use of the cells, the lawsuit states, &ldquo;can only be understood as a choice to embrace a legacy of racial injustice embedded in the US research and medical systems.&rdquo; The Lacks family want the company to release &ldquo;the full amount of its net profits obtained by commercialising the HeLa cell line&rdquo;. They also want Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. to stop using HeLa cells without permission and to create a trust for the Henrietta Lacks Estate.</p> <p class="p3">In December, the company filed a Motion to Dismiss, stating: &ldquo;Thermo Fisher is left in the untenable position of defending itself for the downstream effects of 70-year-old acts in which Thermo Fisher had no part, which took place in a different time, under different norms than today, with no known physician or family witnesses still living.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">They added: &ldquo;A plaintiff cannot wait decades to bring a claim while the scientific community &ndash; including companies that serve it like Thermo Fisher &ndash; makes use of a resource that has been freely and publicly available for the better part of a century.&rdquo; This would, it states, place &ldquo;every researcher (not just Thermo Fisher) who uses HeLa cells . . . under a cloud of potential liability&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">What might unnerve those companies still using the HeLa line is the precedent set by another case nearly four decades ago.</p> <h2 class="p4">John Moore and patient consent</h2> <p class="p5">John Moore was an entrepreneur who learned that he had cancer &ndash; a rare form known as hairy cell leukaemia &ndash; in 1976. Like Lacks, his diagnosis came at the age of 31. Born in Seattle, Moore had an eclectic career which included stints working in Alaska as a survey engineer and alcohol counsellor, establishing a college in Guadalajara, Mexico, becoming a beverage distributor and even a worm farmer.</p> <p class="p3">The condition Moore was diagnosed with caused his spleen to fill with defective lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) and doctors grew fearful that his spleen might burst. He underwent treatment at UCLA&rsquo;s Medical Center, where his spleen was removed. Later, one Dr David Golde, a cancer researcher at the medical centre, realised that the spleen contained unique blood cells of a kind that stimulated white blood cell development. This find was remarkable: white blood cells are needed to fight infection. From the extracted cells, Golde created a replicating cell, which the university then patented under the name &ldquo;Mo&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">John Moore survived the treatment. But when he learned of the patent, he filed a lawsuit against the University of California and Dr Golde, who had not obtained consent to replicate the cells. Moore felt he had been duped. Between 1976-83 he was asked to make frequent trips to Los Angeles from Seattle, believing he was doing so for treatment. In reality, Golde was taking more specimens for the &ldquo;Mo&rdquo; cell line, and by the mid-1980s, he had established contracts with Sandoz Pharmaceuticals and Genetics Institute, Inc. to turn it into a commercial product.</p> <p class="p3">Moore sued for lack of informed consent, fraud and deceit. His legal team argued that he had a right to a portion of the profits made from the &ldquo;Mo&rdquo; line. The case was initially dismissed, before the California Court of Appeal ruled in favour in 1988, stating that a patient&rsquo;s blood and tissue was personal property, meaning that they could take a share in resulting profits.</p> <p class="p3">In 1990, however, the Supreme Court of California reversed the decision. They considered cells to be similar to donated or discarded organs, and believed that laboratories with large amounts of bio materials could not always be expected to know if everything was obtained ethically. At the time, the &ldquo;Mo&rdquo; cell line was valued at $3 billion. Today, it is worth more than $6 billion.</p> <p class="p3">In 1991, Moore took his case to the US Supreme Court, but he was denied again on similar grounds. However, he did negotiate a settlement with UCLA, which covered all of his legal fees, based on the fact that he was an uninformed patient and research subject. The Supreme Court also acknowledged his mistreatment, stating that &ldquo;a physician who is seeking a patient&rsquo;s consent for a medical procedure must . . . disclose personal interest unrelated to the patient&rsquo;s health, whether research or economic, that may affect his medical judgment.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Moore was a white man who had access to medical treatment without prejudice. He was also alive when his cells were being harvested. Yet, while medical standards and the law had progressed significantly in the decades between, there is still a connection between him and Henrietta Lacks. Both were desperate for treatment, and sought care for rare forms of cancer at teaching hospitals. Both were not informed about the basic fact that their bodies were being harvested, creating cell lines which are now worth billions.</p> <p class="p3">Although Moore ultimately lost the case, legal scholars have noted the precedent set by it. &ldquo;He was able to show how his doctors violated their ethical duties to him, which is very serious,&rdquo; says Jorge L. Contreras, an expert in science and technology law at the American Bar Association and a member of the advisory board of the American Antitrust Institute. &ldquo;Even so, the court didn&rsquo;t go as far as he wanted . . . The theory is that (in the hospital) as part of your treatment, you discard cells all the time . . . when you give that vial of blood to the hospital, you can&rsquo;t give it back. It&rsquo;s gone. You give up ownership when you give it to the hospital.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Moore lost when it came to ownership over his cells, but he won when it came to the question of whether doctors breached their ethical duties towards him.</p> <h2 class="p6">A threat to future scientific enquiry?</h2> <p class="p2"><span class="s1">W</span>hat will happen if the Lacks family win? Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. has an estimated annual revenue of $40 billion. In December 2021, it acquired PPD, a renowned global research organization, for $17.4 billion. PPD provides clinical research services to biopharma and biotech companies, all of which require, or have required, HeLa cells to expand their own growth and innovation.</p> <p class="p3">The Lacks family are clear that the lawsuit should not be understood as a threat to the future of scientific enquiry. &ldquo;The Lacks family does not want to stop innovation or research. Instead, we want to end injustice,&rdquo; said Alfred Lacks Carter. &ldquo;We want what is rightfully ours &ndash; the Henrietta Lacks Estate having a say in how her cells and genetic materials are used, to be compensated, and to ensure equitable access to the innovations made possible by the HeLa cells.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">The research community is already paying attention. The Henrietta Lacks Foundation, established by Skoolt in 2010 using proceeds from her book, has received large donations from institutions including the UK biotech firm Abcam and the University of California (San Diego) and a six-figure sum from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2020. The foundation has thus far awarded 90 grants to over 30 members of Henrietta Lacks&rsquo; immediate family.</p> <p class="p3">While the foundation is separate from the case against Thermo Fisher, the donations show that medical institutions are showing an interest in the story.</p> <p class="p3">Meanwhile, Seeger has confirmed that more claims against other companies are likely to be filed soon. &ldquo;What happened to [Henrietta] cannot be changed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but by returning to her family what is rightfully theirs and acknowledging the Lacks family&rsquo;s contribution to scientific advancement, these companies can demonstrate that Black lives are valued and respected.&rdquo;</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p class="p2"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/deception.jpeg" height="636" alt="Deep deception" width="415" /></p> <p class="p1">There was a blue notice on the desk. It said: &ldquo;All police officers wearing plain clothes and all civil staff are required to display identification whilst in this building.&rdquo; I guessed it was a salvaged official sign from a police building somewhere. But its presence on the welcome desk at this conference hall in central London was a symbol of defiance by a group of women and their supporters making a stand against inhumane state surveillance. Their slogan is &ldquo;Police spies out of our lives&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p2">The event was the book launch for <em>Deep Deception</em>. It&rsquo;s authored by five women, Helen Steel (the only one to use her real name), Belinda, Alison, Lisa and Naomi &ndash; all of whom gradually found out the men they thought were their partners were in fact undercover police officers.</p> <p class="p2">It&rsquo;s been more than 20 years since these left-wing activists discovered and exposed how undercover police officers had been infiltrating their groups and having sexual relationships with many women for years. Though the practice goes back to 1968, these women were being spied on from the 1990s to the 2010s. Their boyfriends suddenly disappeared, sometimes leaving a note, often after having or possibly staging breakdowns, leaving their distraught partners worried for their wellbeing. In some cases they had fathered children and abandoned them too.</p> <p class="p2">Yet only now can we appreciate how much we don&rsquo;t yet know about the scale of these operations, as the police have continued to withhold the names and numbers involved.</p> <p class="p4"><em>Deep Deception</em>, told in chronological order, reads like a kind of overlapping thriller, as each woman is trapped by a man following a system of training that had clearly developed over years. They often had a van, so they could take you home and meet your friends. They often got themselves quite senior within the organisation, giving them access to membership lists. In some cases they were involved in the planning and carrying out of crimes. Then there were the clues that only in hindsight read like red flags: on first seeing their place, the women noticed their new boyfriends had very few possessions. The officers usually moved in with them.</p> <p class="p2">Media coverage has too often been only interested in the salacious details of the sexual relationships. As Lisa observed, it was like the fascination with serial killers. What motivates them? Before <em>Deep Deception</em>, Helen, Alison and their solicitor Harriet Wistrich had met the creative team planning a BBC drama inspired by the spycops story, but were deeply unimpressed by what emerged: Peter Moffat&rsquo;s <em>Undercover </em>(2016), starring Adrian Lester and Sophie Okonedo, ended up being a love story about a black undercover officer who was still married to the radical lawyer he&rsquo;d targeted.</p> <p class="p2">Alison spoke out at the time: &ldquo;To give the impression that the undercover relationships that inspired this drama were based on reciprocal love &ndash; where no other woman is being cheated on and lied to &ndash; is to misrepresent the deceitful individuals involved, and to misunderstand the power dynamics and sexual politics that underpinned them.&rdquo; In fact, by 1996, officers working in the SDS unit &ndash; the Special Demonstration Squad &ndash; were required to be married before deployment, to ensure they had an external life to return to. The undercover cops called the women activists they slept with &ldquo;wearies&rdquo;, as in wearisome. In February 2022, a report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct into the misogynist and sexist culture at Charing Cross police station in central London found that male officers used the same term to describe female officers.</p> <p class="p2">As a journalist, reading <em>Deep Deception</em> was like having a veil lifted from my eyes. So many of the stories I&rsquo;d covered over my career turned out to have had a covert police operation involved in manipulating and entrapping activists: the McLibel case, for example, where a leaflet opposing McDonalds was later found to have been co-written by an undercover police officer, or the mass arrests of green activists at Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station before their protest had even begun.</p> <p class="p2">As Lisa said at the book launch, there is real sadness for the lost decade or more when climate change activism was derailed by these operations, given the warnings now being issued by the UN&rsquo;s IPCC. The ongoing public inquiry into covert policing is only expected to complete taking evidence in 2025. These women are determined not to let this scandal disappear under the weight of time. There is still a reckoning due, with those officers yet to retire, and a wider awakening for a nation that has been too complacent about the very British idea of policing by consent.</p> <p class="p2"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/coakley.jpeg" height="887" alt="Orthodox church in Warsaw" width="1323" /></p> <p class="p1">Joanna Kos formed her relationship with God in her mid-teens. A friend took her to a prayer group outside of school hours, and in that room in a little corner of Warsaw, the schoolgirl&rsquo;s life changed forever. Faith, she told me, brought her peace and gave her confidence.</p> <p class="p3">Her classmates soon noticed a change in their friend. Most people in the school identified as Catholic, but none attended mass on a regular basis. Going to the local church, however, had quickly become a part of Joanna&rsquo;s weekly routine. Although everyone respected her new devotion, there was a problem, she told me when I met her at a central Warsaw caf&eacute;. She often felt excluded from debates around certain topics, like abortion or equal marriage.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;When friends were talking about LGBT issues I was always just sitting and listening and wanting to understand them,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Before, when I tried to join the conversation, I wasn&rsquo;t heard. Everyone was like: &lsquo;Okay just shut up,&rsquo; a bit like: &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything.&rsquo; Perhaps I didn&rsquo;t, but I still wanted to understand their points of view, and I wanted to have that chance to speak too.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Now 20, Joanna is a slight woman with mousy hair and delicate features. She moves thoughtfully, her voice quiet. &ldquo;The implications were that because I was [a practising] Catholic, I didn&rsquo;t know anything about the world, that I was stupid or naive.&rdquo; That sense of being shunned by liberal classmates for her conservative values stayed with Joanna. When the time came to choose a place for further education, she told me she wanted to go somewhere that she wouldn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;sentenced to silence&rdquo;. A new institution caught her eye, the Collegium Intermarium in downtown Warsaw: the brainchild of Europe&rsquo;s most controversial ultra-conservative lawyers.</p> <h2 class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Collegium Intermarium: producing a new European elite?</span></h2> <p class="p3">The doors of the privately funded college swung open in May 2021. The promise to prospective students was that the institution would uphold &ldquo;classical values&rdquo; and be an answer to the global &ldquo;crisis of academic life&rdquo;. But the group that established the academy, the Education for Values Foundation, has strong links to Ordo Iuris &ndash; an opaque legal organisation that has influenced the rolling back of women&rsquo;s reproductive rights in Poland and supported anti-LGBTQ+ measures. It has also rejected the Istanbul Convention, a treaty that seeks to end violence against women, on the grounds that the convention promotes so-called &ldquo;gender ideology&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">At present, the Collegium Intermarium offers just one undergraduate course, in law. Joanna is one of only 17 undergraduates currently enrolled, although the college has plans to expand into business management. Arounda hundred more students are engaged in part-time postgraduate studies, in subjects ranging from NGO management to the art of debate and &ldquo;family policy in local authorities&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">In its essence, the Collegium Intermarium is an attempt to groom the next generation of ultra-conservative thinkers, lawyers and policy-makers. And the college has ambitions that reach beyond Poland: its website declares that it wants to educate the &ldquo;elite of the intermarium countries&rdquo;. &ldquo;Intermarium&rdquo; is Latin for &ldquo;between the seas&rdquo; and refers to a swathe of central Europe that lies between the Baltic, Black and Adriatic Seas. The ultimate goal appears to be to draw students from these ex-communist countries, which might be seen as more conservative and in opposition to the &ldquo;liberal west&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">It would be easy to dismiss this budding institution as a niche project on the fringes of academic life. But to do so would be to underestimate the influence Ordo Iuris and its associates have already had on shaping Poland&rsquo;s moral economy. The chairman of the college&rsquo;s board, Jerzy Kwa≈õniewski, who is also the President of Ordo Iuris, has been explicit about this goal. He told Polish media last year that Collegium Intermarium graduates will &ldquo;shape the politics, law and identity of Europe&rdquo;.</p> <h2 class="p4">The influence of Ordo Iuris</h2> <p class="p5">The ultra-conservative beliefs of Ordo Iuris, and by extension Collegium Intermarium, appear to be very much in line with the government&rsquo;s own vision of Poland and its future. Since the Law and Justice party, or PiS, returned to power in 2015, they have introduced a series of extremely conservative policies. The party, led by Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, has relentlessly pursued a narrative that Poland is caught in a values war with the liberal west who have destroyed the &ldquo;traditional family&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">Reproductive rights are a key battleground. In 2020, abortion in Poland was effectively outlawed after the government-controlled Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the procedure was unconstitutional in cases of foetal abnormality as it amounted to a &ldquo;forbidden form of discrimination&rdquo;. Today, abortion is only available in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother&rsquo;s life is considered to be in serious danger. At least two women have already died in Poland after being denied lifesaving care as a consequence of this ruling.</p> <p class="p3">The case was brought to the Constitutional Tribunal by 119 conservative parliamentarians. But for years, Ordo Iuris had been seeding the ground for the roll-back of women&rsquo;s reproductive rights. In 2016 they drafted a law that proposed a near total ban on abortion. The legislation kickstarted the iconic &ldquo;Black Protests&rdquo;, where women and men took to the streets to defend human rights. Although parliamentarians ultimately rejected the bill, Ordo Iuris used its strong connections with PiS to keep the issue of abortion on the national agenda.</p> <p class="p3">Ordo Iuris has also influenced the rolling back of LGBTQ+ rights across Poland. It developed a &ldquo;pro-family&rdquo; document, the &ldquo;Local Government Charter of Family Rights&rdquo;, to defend the &ldquo;values confirmed&rdquo; in the Polish Constitution. According to the charter, these include the &ldquo;protection of marriage, being a union of a man and a woman&rdquo; and the right to protect children against &ldquo;demoralisation&rdquo;. The charter has now been adopted by 39 local authorities. Ordo Iuris denies that the charter is discriminatory, as it does not mention LGBTQ+ people specifically. But activists have described local authorities who have adopted the charter as &ldquo;LGBTQ-free zones&rdquo; where their values and rights are not respected.</p> <p class="p3">Some of the new legislation also appears to be in tension with European law. In January, Poland&rsquo;s lower house, the Sejm, passed a bill influenced by Ordo Iuris that would make it harder for the children of LGBTQ+ people to obtain a Polish passport, a move that runs counter to the European Court of Justice&rsquo;s December ruling that requires all member states to issue &ldquo;an identity card or a passport to a child who is a national of that member state and whose parents are two persons of the same sex&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">In contrast to many other European countries, a significant proportion of young people in Poland appear to support this shift to cultural conservativism. While there has been a steep decline in religious practice among younger generations, the pivotal 2015 election saw a shift to the right, with two thirds of voters between 18 and 29 voting for right-wing parties. Since then, ultra-conservatives in the country have been keen to capitalise on this trend and make young people central to their long-term ambitions.</p> <h2 class="p4">Family, religion and the "European tradition"</h2> <p class="p5">Sitting in his Warsaw apartment, twirling a cigarette gently between his fingers, Filip Ludwin seems to find it comical that some people think the Collegium Intermarium&rsquo;s intentions are nefarious. The dean of the law faculty, Ludwin is keen to distance the institution from Ordo Iuris. &ldquo;We are interested in conducting broad research in all fields of [social] science,&rdquo; he told me, peering over his rectangular glasses. &ldquo;It means we are open to all [social] scientific issues. Ordo Iuris is mainly interested in social issues that are connected with a concrete vision of society, and they advocate for that vision . . . the two institutions are partially similar but it&rsquo;s important to underline the differences between them.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Like most of Poland&rsquo;s ultra-conservatives, Ludwin is well-groomed and polite. He thinks before he speaks, avoids religious arguments and has a talent for dancing around answers to difficult questions. He dislikes the term &ldquo;ultra-conservative&rdquo; and feels the aims of the Collegium Intermarium have been widely misunderstood. &ldquo;From our point of view, lawyers are not only professionals, but they should also have a deep humanistic and classical background too . . . We don&rsquo;t omit practical aspects of [legal] studies, but a part of what we would like to present to our students is a broad humanistic, historical and philosophical background.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Yet the institution&rsquo;s dedication to &ldquo;creating an academic community deeply rooted in European tradition and culture&rdquo; appears to be motivated by ultra-conservative thought.</p> <p class="p5">Neil Datta, the Secretary of the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, has tirelessly been calling attention to Ordo Iuris and its affiliates for years. From his office in Brussels he has done ground-breaking work on Europe&rsquo;s ultra-conservative network and the money supporting it. &ldquo;Ordo Iuris is a revamped expression of the much older network of &lsquo;Tradition, Family, Property&rsquo;, or TFP, and if you go into the history of TFP what you will find is several decades of trying to create institutions to educate children and young people, so this is the latest iteration of the same tendency,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What strikes me about the Collegium Intermarium, and what makes it stand out, is that Ordo Iuris is a much stronger organisation than previous TFP organisations in other countries, so there is more potential for it to take off.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">TFP is a global Catholic organisation accused of operating like a cult. In 1995 and 1999, for example, it was on the French National Assembly list of cult-like movements. Founded in Brazil by Plinio Corr&ecirc;a de Oliveira‚ÄØin 1960, the movement has deeply conservative views on abortion and equal marriage. It&rsquo;s also highly critical of relatively liberal pontiffs such as Pope Francis.</p> <p class="p3">Ordo Iuris says it has no connection to TFP. However, connections stretch back to 2001, when the Father Piotr Skarga Association &ndash; a Catholic organisation that says it was &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by TFP &ndash; founded the Father Piotr Skarga Foundation, which in turn created Ordo Iuris in 2013. Curiously, the Father Piotr Skarga Association, TFP and Ordo Iuris all use the same gold lion logo.</p> <p class="p3">Datta also points out that the Collegium Intermarium does not have to be particularly big to have a significant impact on European society. &ldquo;When you look at the College of Europe in Belgium, it&rsquo;s known for producing future elites [who] then go into the European institutions. Their graduating class is around 200 to 300 even though it was established in the 1950s,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It looks like the ambition of the Collegium Intermarium is to create such an elite institution.&rdquo;</p> <h2 class="p4">Teaching the next generation of ultra-conservatives</h2> <p class="p5">In the United States, the Patrick Henry College is another institution with aims to produce an elite. Situated in Purcellville, Virginia, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Harvard&rdquo;, as it has been nicknamed, was the alma mater of several of Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration, including the former White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farah. It attracted a range of conservative teaching staff, including Dr Stephen Baskerville, who worked at the college as professor of government until 2019.</p> <p class="p3">Baskerville, known for his book <em>A Gentleman&rsquo;s Guide to Manners, Sex, and Ruling the World</em>, is a controversial figure, accused of making homophobic statements during his tenure at Patrick Henry College, and criticised for appearing alongside white supremacist activist Richard Spencer in 2013. Despite the conservative and Christian leanings of Patrick Henry College, Baskerville says he felt that his opinions were being stifled in the United States. Around this time, Ordo Iuris called to offer the 64-year-old a job as the head of state studies at the Collegium Intermarium.</p> <p class="p3">It was perfect timing, he told me. He had spoken at numerous conferences organised by Ordo Iuris and agreed with their worldview. &ldquo;I felt like [in] the fields which I was publishing in, and the fields that I was teaching in, there were increasing demands to include political ideologies in the substance of what I was doing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This was necessary for career advancement or simple survival. It was very clear that people who did not subscribe to certain political ideologies were pushed to the margins.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">I asked him whether political ideologies were evident at Collegium Intermarium, where he has been teaching Joanna and her classmates for the last year. He answered that it was hard to say what the views of his students are, as he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;see the classroom as a place to express personal opinions&rdquo;. The irony is that while the representatives for the Collegium Intermarium are quick to wax lyrical about academic freedom and open debate, all of its teaching staff appear to share the same ultra-conservative views. Many are ardent supporters of PiS.</p> <p class="p3">Ordo Iuris, meanwhile, has close links to the government. The group&rsquo;s former president and co-founder Aleksander Stƒôpkowski is currently the spokesperson for the Polish Supreme Court. Poland&rsquo;s Minister of Culture Piotr Glinski and Minister of Education Przemyslaw Czarnek both attended the Collegium Intermarium&rsquo;s launch event in 2021.</p> <p class="p5">Most of the ultra-conservatives I spoke to in Poland were keen to paint themselves as advocates of free speech and the victims of a liberal purge. Their voices weren&rsquo;t heard, they said. The doors to global corridors of power were closed to them. Their anger at this state of affairs was palpable despite their polite exteriors. They apparently saw themselves not as dangerous ideological crusaders, but as human rights defenders and the guardians of Europe&rsquo;s traditions.</p> <p class="p3">It was a more developed version of how Joanna Kos felt in high school when she was excluded from lunchtime conversations because of her Catholic beliefs.</p> <p class="p3">&ldquo;There is a conservative revolution happening in Poland, especially among young people,&rdquo; says Milosz Hodun from the progressive NGO Liberal International, who is concerned about the college and the future impact of its alumni. &ldquo;A lot of this is about educating the next generation of voters and giving them the skills to compete with the elites of other EU member states.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Not a day has gone by since her first class in October that Joanna has regretted her decision to enroll in the Collegium Intermarium. Her classmates are interesting and kind, she tells me. The teaching staff are accommodating, and she feels free to voice her opinions.</p> <p class="p3">So will Joanna, with her law degree, go on to become a member of the new ultra-conservative elite in Poland, a new army of lawyers able to influence the direction of Europe? The future is uncertain, although she has already considered joining Ordo Iuris after she graduates. &ldquo;Maybe I will, maybe I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she says.</p> <p class="p3"><em>This piece is from the New Humanist summer 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>Do you know how best to cut your carbon footprint?</p>



<p>I recently invited people to take an online survey about sustainable lifestyle changes and over 800 people kindly responded. The work was conducted with Prof Mike Page from the University of Hertfordshire and Edinburgh Science, and the results are now in!</p>



<p>Everyone were asked to estimate how many kilograms of carbon dioxide would be saved by taking a range of actions. Many of the ratings were hugely inaccurate, with people generally overestimating the effects of less impactful changes, such as unplugging appliances, but underestimating the contribution of larger lifestyle changes such as following a vegetarian diet. For example</p>



<p>‚Ä¶.unplugging a mobile phone charger saves around 2kg of CO2 emissions per year; yet one third of respondents thought that it saved five times that (100kg or more).</p>



<p>‚Ä¶.leaving a television on standby emits around 15kg of CO2 per year, but a third of respondents estimated that it was far more significant (125 kg&nbsp;or more).</p>



<p>‚Ä¶.becoming a vegetarian can save over 600kg, yet half of the respondents thought that it only saved 300kg or less.</p>



<p>‚Ä¶buying a blue jumper rather than a red one has no impact at all, but, on average, people thought that it would save 37kg.</p>



<p>The good news is that other estimates about, for example, the impact of flying, were more accurate. Every little helps, and people should consider doing whatever they can to cut emissions. However, these results suggest that there are many widely believed myths about sustainable behaviour. There‚Äôs a real appetite to make changes, which is great, but many of us may need clearer information on how make the biggest impact.</p>



<p>Many thanks to everyone who was kind enough to take part.</p>

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield‚Äôs amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield‚Äôs shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer‚Äôs stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box. ¬†There is a ¬†need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with ¬†Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually¬†<em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>

<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth?¬†Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website¬†<em>is¬†</em>called¬†<em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here.¬†<strong>Zero-hour¬†</strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered.¬†<strong>Zero-time¬†</strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be¬†<em>teaching¬†</em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake¬†<em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t¬†<em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a>¬†on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one‚Äôs area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn‚Äôt capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>¬∑ Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>¬∑ Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn‚Äôt yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging¬†<em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already¬†<em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but¬†<em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage,¬†<em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
