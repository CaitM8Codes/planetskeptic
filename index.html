I want to do that! It&#8217;s a bad time of year for it though, since it&#8217;s about -20Â°C out there, and if the spiders are all frozen, what&#8217;s the point? Once the world thaws again, I need to get out and do some exploring. These places are <em>full</em> of spiders, and I don&#8217;t have to interact with people to investigate them &#8212; spiders minus people? Perfection.</p>
<p>This summer you all have to help out by nagging me to get out and find abandoned houses, farms, and shacks, every weekend. I&#8217;ll reward you with pictures &#8212; lots of close-up pictures of creepy crawlies. It&#8217;ll be awesome.</p>
<p>For now, here&#8217;s an example: this guy explores an abandoned house and finds an abandoned 1973 Corvette in the garage. It&#8217;s February, though, so no spiders, which makes it a lot less interesting.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s got to be an interesting story behind it. This is an isolated, tiny house &#8212; am I the only one thinking it&#8217;s a drug house? &#8212; with an expensive car rotting and neglected. Where&#8217;s the owner? What happened that no one would claim that car? And most importantly, what kind of spiders will be flourishing there once the weather warms up?</p>

<p class="lead">What? You never heard of Gettr? Here&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettr">Wikipedia&#8217;s summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gettr (stylized GETTR) is a social media platform and microblogging site targeted to American conservatives. It was founded by Jason Miller, a former Donald Trump aide, and was officially launched on July 4, 2021. Its user interface and feature set have been described as very similar to those of Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, basically, Twitter for assholes, which is kind of redundant (Twitter is already for assholes!). But this one is a <em>worse</em> version of Twitter, if you can imagine that.</p>
<blockquote><p>The platform experienced issues shortly after launch, including internet trolls posting content that violated the terms of service, users flooding it with pornography, and the brief hacking of some high-profile accounts. Journalists have observed the prevalence of extreme content on the platform, including racism, antisemitism, and terrorist propaganda.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had to look it up, because while I&#8217;d heard of it, vaguely, I&#8217;d never bothered to visit it or look deeper into it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find this hard to believe, but <a href="https://www.joemygod.com/2022/02/gettr-fires-top-staffers-amid-financial-problems/">Gettr is in trouble</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Social media upstart GETTR fired over a dozen staff members late last year, including two key executives and its entire IT and cybersecurity teams, amid rapid growth and what former employees said were funding problems.</p>
<p>The layoffs came even as interest in the company, founded by Jason Miller, a spokesman for former President Donald Trump, exploded.</p>
<p>But three people who were canned say that behind the scenes, GETTR is struggling with more than just growing pains, warning that the recent round of layoffs may have jeopardized the platformâs security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Curiously for a far right-wing site, it&#8217;s so open-minded that it is a recruiting ground for <em>both</em> the Proud Boys and ISIL. I guess if you want to watch beheading videos or see Canadians getting beaten up by roving gangs of thugs, you&#8217;d better sign up fast before it&#8217;s gone. Hey, Joe Rogan has an account there!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Screenshot-_16_.jpg" height="807" alt="Exhumation cover" width="911" /></p> <p>What, you might wonder, is the connection between an episode of <em>Dr Who</em> and a hero of the Indian independence struggle, executed by the British in 1909? Leena Dhingra, the author of <em>Exhumation</em>, joins the dots for us. As a character actor, she played the role of a 90-year-old Indian woman in an episode in which the Doctor time travels to 17 August 1947, the day when the Radcliffe Line was arbitrarily drawn across the face of India, releasing bloodshed and untold misery. Moved by the parallels between her character&rsquo;s story and her own memories of Partition, which split India from Pakistan, Leena resolved to do some time travelling of her own.<br /><br />The result is <em>Exhumation</em>, which takes the reader back to 1909, when Leena&rsquo;s great uncle, Madan Lal Dhingra, shot Sir Curzon Wyllie, personal assistant to the Secretary of State for India, point blank in the face, and paid for it with his life. The book weaves a double-stranded narrative, following the life and death of Madan Lal along with the author&rsquo;s own journey. Her uncle&rsquo;s fight for an independent India ends in Partition &ndash; the creation of Pakistan as a homeland for Muslims &ndash; and displacement for the young Leena. The Dhingra family were part of the Indian elite and felt deeply compromised by Madan Lal, whose actions were anything but heroic for them. Thus, <em>Exhumation</em> is both a historical biography and a family memoir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Madan Lal&rsquo;s remains were returned to a hero&rsquo;s welcome in India in 1976. Leena sees parallels between this exhumation and the act of digging up buried truths in the telling of her own story. The resulting book, however, is arguably more reclamation than exhumation, as it helps Leena find a foothold on this earth, and a reconnection with India.</p> <h2><span class="Apple-converted-space">Traces of right-wing Hindu ideology</span></h2> <p>There are darker aspects to how that past now resonates. A fellow anti-imperialist revolutionary, friend and mentor of Madan Lal&rsquo;s, V. D. Savarkar, went on to develop the concept of Hindutva, an exclusivist philosophy that conflates Indian identity with Hindu identity, and has now been adopted by the ultra-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We look for traces of the right-wing Hindu ideologue in this sketch of Savarkar as a young man. <span class="Apple-converted-space"><br /></span><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br /></span>Leena has done a brilliant job in reimagining the history of Madan Lal&rsquo;s times, the fervour of the young Indian students in London and the conservatism of his wealthy family. Yet bringing her uncle to life seems to have been a challenge. This may be down to his character, as, by all accounts, Madan Lal was a reticent man. Even at his trial, having decided to represent himself, he remains tight-lipped, asking for the statement he had prepared in advance of the shooting to be read out (he had planned to turn the gun on himself after killing Wyllie, but ran out of bullets). The statement, which was in his pocket, had been &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; by the authorities in a typical example of the British stage-managing the trial. The only words that he uttered in court himself were: &lsquo;&lsquo;I do not acknowledge the authority of the court. You can pass sentence of death on me. You white people are all powerful now, but we shall have our turn in time to come.&rdquo;<br /><br /><em>Exhumation</em> keeps us in suspense, hoping that Madan Lal&rsquo;s original statement will be found. Leena finally reproduces an article from the <em>Daily News,</em> which published the statement in full but declined to say how it got hold of it. However, it is also disappointingly short, at 216 words, and not particularly revelatory of Madan Lal, the man. &ldquo;The only lesson required in India today,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;is to learn how to die and the only way to teach it is by dying ourselves; therefore I die and glory in my martyrdom.&rdquo; We learn that Churchill quoted these words with admiration as the finest ever made in the name of patriotism.<br /><br />Madan Lal is today commemorated as a martyr in the state of Punjab, as well as here in Britain by the Indian Workers Association. But we still know little about him, and <em>Exhumation</em> only gives us so much. It is as if the writer&rsquo;s imagination trembled in the presence of a corpse buried for so long. But as a blend of historical biography and personal memoir, the book works well. The consequences of that momentous killing continue to reverberate in modern-day India, but Leena Dhingra&rsquo;s personal trauma has been laid to rest.<br /><br /><em><span class="Apple-converted-space">This piece is from the New Humanist winter edition 2021. <a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</span></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/pi-1453836_1280.jpg" height="806" alt="Pi" width="1210" /></p> <p>Pi (&pi;) is the mathematical symbol used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Or, alternatively, it is how many diameters fit around the periphery of a circle. For at least 4,000 years, people have wondered about the exact value of pi. The Ancient Chinese used three, the Babylonians 3.125, and the Egyptians 3.16049. The reality is that pi&rsquo;s value is fundamentally unknowable. Beyond the decimal point, its digits march on all the way out to infinity. Not only does this make pi an enigmatic number; historically, it has been a shocking one too. Theologians, not surprisingly, were horrified at the idea of a number that was unknowable even to God.</p> <p>In modern times, finding a record number of digits of pi has become a computational sport &ndash; a convenient measure of the number-crunching power of our cutting-edge computers. The newest record holder, announced in August, is a supercomputer used by Swiss researchers to obtain an astonishing 62.8 trillion digits of pi. The machine, at the Graub&uuml;nden University of Applied Sciences in Chur, laboured for 108 days and nine hours. Though a marathon computation, it took only a third of the time taken to obtain the 50 trillion digits of the previous world record holder.</p> <p>Pi is not only a mathematical curiosity. It pops up in all formulae that describe circles wherever they appear in nature: in the spiral double-staircase of DNA, on the surface of the Sun, and, remarkably, even in the meandering of streams and rivers. What all of these things have in common is that they are cycles in space. But pi also pops up in cycles in time: in heartbeats and in all kinds of waves, from ripples on a pond to the electromagnetic waves that carry phone, radio and TV signals around the world. And because the &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; realm which underpins our world is wave-like, pi even appears in the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which describes the fundamental fuzziness of the submicroscopic universe &ndash; how, like a grainy newspaper photograph, it dissolves into nothingness when looked at too closely.</p> <p>Pi is so fascinating to some that there is even a Pi Day to celebrate the myriad wonders of the number. It was inaugurated in 1988 by physicist Larry Shaw of San Francisco&rsquo;s Exploratorium science museum. Dubbed the &ldquo;Prince of Pi&rdquo;, he chose 14 March because Americans abbreviate pi as 3.14, its first three digits. Albert Einstein was born on Pi Day, while Stephen Hawking died on it. A very special Pi Day was 14 March 2015, or 3.14.15, which encapsulates the first five digits of pi. For most of us, it was a once-in-a-lifetime day &ndash; though not of course for those who are currently over 100 or who will live to be over 100.</p> <h2>Gregory Chaitin vs. pi</h2> <p>Interestingly, although pi goes on forever, its digits never repeating, it is not the most complicated number imaginable &ndash; at least according to algorithmic information theory. This mathematical field, developed by a 15-year-old Argentinean-American called Gregory Chaitin, equates the complexity of a number with the length of the computer program &ndash; written in the 0s and 1s of binary arithmetic &ndash; needed to generate it. Pi requires a relatively short computer program to create, and so, by this measure, is not a very complex number. By contrast, omega (&Omega;), otherwise known as &ldquo;Chaitin&rsquo;s number&rdquo;, requires an infinitely long computer program. Incapable of being summarised by, or compressed into, fewer digits than its actual length, it makes pi appear a mere pipsqueak.</p> <p>But this does not lessen people&rsquo;s fascination with pi. One person captivated by the number was Carl Sagan, the American planetary scientist and science populariser. In the movie of his novel <em>Contact</em>, Eleanor Arroway, played by Jodie Foster, finds a message embedded in the digits of pi, left by a super-civilisation responsible for constructing our Universe: a string of 1s and 0s that, when assembled into a grid, depicts&hellip; a circle!</p> <p>Actually, because pi goes on forever, literally any string of numbers will eventually crop up. Sagan was well aware of this, which is why the string of 1s and 0s found by Arroway appears early on in the sequence of digits, left there in order to be easily discovered by the human race.</p> <p>But pi is a purely mathematical number, defined with no reference to physical reality, and so cannot be adjusted through any scientific advance &ndash; not even by a super-civilisation of highly intelligent aliens. The irony is that Sagan, who was an atheist, was describing something that could only be achieved by a Supreme Being!</p> <article class="a2-a8 t2-t7 m-all m-padinfull"> <div class="text-body a-all a-padinfull t-all t-padinfull m-all"> <div class="main-content a3-a7 a-clear t-all t-clear m-all"> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p> </div> </div> </article>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="A still from &ldquo;Only Murders in the Building&rdquo;, starring Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin (Disney+)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/oms1_101_cb-3765rt-_1_.jpg" height="533" alt="Only Murders in the Building" width="800" /></p> <p>The first time that I pressed play on a podcast, it was 2007 and I had just spent half an hour working out how to download the mp3 file. Hearing the hosts&rsquo; voices coming out of my headphones was a thrill. This was a new audio medium where in theory anybody could bypass the traditional media gatekeepers at places like BBC Radio 4 or NPR and find success.<br /><br />Years later, in autumn 2014, I was one of millions of people tuning in to <em>Serial</em>, the account of the producers&rsquo; investigation into the 1999 murder of Korean-American teenager Hae Min Lee that quickly became a global phenomenon. Its on-air reconstructions of Lee&rsquo;s disappearance and its unpacking of contradictory alibis and motives gripped me. The smooth voice of host Sarah Koenig became so influential that it can be heard replicated everywhere today across the true crime podcast genre.<br /><br />Years on from the release of <em>Serial</em>, I pressed play on the first episode of the new television show <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>. It stars the unlikely trio of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez as residents of a fancy pre-Second World War apartment block on the Upper West Side in Manhattan who team up to solve a murder after a body is found in their building. They meet, however, because of a podcast. On the night of the crime, the three are separately settling down to enjoy the latest episode of their favourite show, <em>All is Not OK in Oklahoma</em>, hosted by the &ldquo;queen of true crime&rdquo; Cinda Canning. The building is then evacuated. Desperate for some peace and a reliable internet connection to enjoy the show, the characters band together in a local restaurant to listen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>When the nature of the disruption in their building becomes clear, therefore, it is natural that these true crime podcast obsessives would want to start their own show about it. It&rsquo;s the perfect excuse for them to turn amateur sleuth, sneaking around with microphones and covertly interviewing their neighbours. They each come to it with different motivations: Martin&rsquo;s washed-up TV actor Charles-Haden Savage sees it as a chance to get back in the limelight, Short&rsquo;s out of work Broadway director Oliver Putnam senses an opportunity to make some serious cash, and Gomez&rsquo;s Mabel Mora is seemingly the only one who cares about what happened to the victim.<br /><br /><em>Only Murders in the Building</em> is a passable mystery series with some gorgeous sets and costumes. It is most interesting, though, as the latest and arguably most successful attempt to date to translate the wild popularity of podcasts onto the screen. References to this audio-only medium are layered into every aspect of the series, from the regular use of voiceover to narrate what the characters are doing to the score, which very deliberately mimics the style of music ubiquitous in true crime podcasts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>For those who have tried to make a podcast themselves (a popular lockdown activity), there are plenty of pleasingly jokey references to the process, too. Martin&rsquo;s character swelters as he records his narration in a makeshift studio in a walk-in wardrobe. Much of the comic dynamic he has with Short comes from the latter&rsquo;s regular insistence that they &ldquo;retake&rdquo; especially meaningful or touching conversations so they can capture a better version.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>In one memorable scene, the trio actually get to meet their podcasting hero, Cinda Canning, who is played in a sparkling cameo by Tina Fey (she has Sarah Koenig&rsquo;s &ldquo;podcast voice&rdquo; down pat). She takes a call part way through their meeting and confirms that she has just sold her podcast company for $30 million, in a reference to the rush of acquisitions in the real-life podcast industry in the last two years. The closer you look, the more meta it becomes: Canning&rsquo;s blockbuster podcast <em>All is Not OK in Oklahoma</em> is clearly a parody of <em>Serial</em>, and Serial Productions itself was acquired by the <em>New York Times</em> in July 2020 in a deal reportedly worth $25 million.</p> <h2>Transforming the podcast industry</h2> <p>While watching <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, I wondered how many of the inside podcast jokes would land with the TV audience. But as the series went on, I remembered that over 100 million people listened to the first series of <em>Serial</em>, and many more have since followed one of the numerous true crime podcasts that launched in its wake. In 2007, making or consuming podcasts was a very niche activity. Now, it&rsquo;s just another form of mass media.<br /><br />The lure of television has been a big part of the podcast industry&rsquo;s transformation. Insiders have been talking up the potential of the so-called &ldquo;podcast-to-TV pipeline&rdquo; for some time now, and in the last five years Hollywood studios and streaming giants alike have woken up to the fact that there is a lot of valuable intellectual property, ripe for adaptation, in the audio sphere. After more than a decade of being reliant on changeable advertising revenue, acquisition and rights sales now offer a select few podcasters with a large enough audience alternative, and highly lucrative, revenue streams.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>All of this has resulted in a kind of podcasting gold rush, prompting a series of high-profile acquisitions as major television and audio companies compete to stake the biggest claim in the space. The audio streaming platform Spotify has made a string of such purchases, scooping up the Gimlet network &ndash; known for such narrative podcasts as <em>Reply All </em>and <em>Crimetown</em> &ndash; in February 2019 for a reported $200 million, followed by true crime production studio Parcast for $56 million. Subsequent deals have included the $100 million paid to libertarian superstar Joe Rogan in May 2020 to make his podcast exclusive to the Spotify platform.<br /><br />The problem is that all of this money and talk about the vast potential of adapting podcasts for television has yet to produce a single really good TV series. The closest contender is <em>Homecoming</em>, an Amazon drama that debuted in 2018, based on the fiction podcast of the same name. A serviceable but not exceptional thriller, it was the casting of Julia Roberts in her first ever small screen role that occupied most of the critics&rsquo; attention. Even then, this series stands head and shoulders above the rest.</p> <h2>Adapting the true crime genre</h2> <p>It would be best, meanwhile, not to dwell on the low point represented by <em>Alex, Inc</em>., which premiered the same year as <em>Homecoming</em>. It was an adaptation of the Gimlet podcast <em>Startup</em>, a non-fiction series that chronicled the podcast company&rsquo;s founding, starring Zach Braff as a radio journalist who quit his job to start a podcast company. It was cancelled after two months, although the highly memeable images of Braff holding microphones wrongly will never be forgotten.<br /><br />The true crime podcast genre has been particularly attractive to would-be television adaptors, given its built-in narrative appeal and vast audience, but has similarly failed to generate any real hits. Pulpy, gruesome audio series like <em>Dirty John </em>and<em> The Shrink Next Door</em> have both made it to the small screen, but failed to make much of an impact in this era of non-stop prestige TV. Non-fiction has fared better, with documentary makers picking up where the <em>Serial</em> team and others have left off, but that genre lacks the astronomical commercial returns possible with a drama or comedy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>By contrast, <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> seems to represent a new departure for podcasts on screen. Although not an adaptation of any one audio series, the TV show is so steeped in the form that it is impossible to separate the two. The writers managed to integrate true crime podcast tropes and references without sacrificing the appeal of the main story, and in doing so have created something with the &ldquo;What will happen next?&rdquo; appeal of <em>Serial</em> without exploiting a real tragedy or playing a death for laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Seeing Martin, Short and Gomez tune into their favourite podcast on screen felt familiar, reminding me of all the times I&rsquo;ve waited eagerly for a new episode to drop. Podcasting is part of those characters&rsquo; lives, just as it is for millions of us.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Barely three decades later, the moral and political authority of the Catholic Church in Ireland had collapsed, destroyed most of all by devastating revelations of clerical sex abuse and cover-up. How and why Ireland lost faith in the Catholic Church, and how it feels about Catholicism now, is the subject of this book. Derek Scally is a Berlin-based Irish journalist who returned to his homeland to explore how his and his country&rsquo;s Catholic past &ldquo;went from rigid reality to vanishing act&rdquo; and to &ldquo;reflect on the trauma that remains&rdquo;.</p> <p>Post-independence Ireland was not quite a de jure theocracy, but for many decades it was certainly a de facto one. The 1937 Constitution of Ireland explicitly recognised the &ldquo;special position&rdquo; of the Roman Catholic Church &ldquo;as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of its citizens&rdquo;. This provision was removed in 1972, but the might of the Catholic Church in Ireland lay less in formal constitutional power and more in the societal influence it wielded, particularly over education and health.</p> <p>This influence was seen in episodes like the &ldquo;mother and child&rdquo; scheme controversy in 1948, when the socialist health minister No&euml;l Browne had to resign after his healthcare programme was deemed contrary to Catholic teaching. From 1937 to 1995 divorce and remarriage were not permitted in Ireland. For many decades contraception and abortion were also prohibited (even now, following the 2018 referendum, access to abortion remains fairly restricted). Censorship was also extensive.</p> <p>The reasons why the Catholic Church came to have the whip hand over Irish society are complex. In the 19th century parts of the Irish independence movement had non-sectarian &ndash; or even, to use later parlance, secularist &ndash; leanings. The 1790s Irish independence leader Wolfe Tone famously sought to &ldquo;unite Catholics and dissenters&rdquo; and the authors of the 1867 Proclamation of the Irish Republic declared in favour of &ldquo;absolute liberty of conscience, and the complete separation of church and state&rdquo;. But after partition and independence in 1922 the Catholic Church manoeuvred itself into a societally dominant role. The version of Catholicism which prevailed thereafter was a particularly harsh, abusive and anti-intellectual one: &ldquo;a mental prison to be endured,&rdquo; as Scally describes it.</p> <p>An issue which permeates much of his book is the extent of societal knowledge of, and complicity in, the abuses perpetrated by the institutional church. When it came to clerical sex abuse, so many people &ldquo;knew but didn&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. As Scally says, &ldquo;Survivors of neglect and abuse are the victims. Those with power carry the guilt. And what of those of us in between? Where do we place ourselves on the sliding scale between innocence and complicity? Can we separate guilt from shame, and begin exploring?&rdquo;</p> <p>This raises many interesting questions, including about the conformity and deference so prevalent in 20th-century Ireland, which Scally examines with skill and subtlety. I would like him to have said more about those who did resist and challenge Church power in Ireland, and what differentiated them from those who didn&rsquo;t. But perhaps that would be a different book. This is not a formal history, but rather an attempt at understanding how a society feels about its recent past, and how it comes to terms with it. On that aspect, Scally draws some interesting contrasts between Ireland and another society he knows well and which also carries the burden of history: Germany.</p> <p>Many Germans consider that while no one alive today carries blame for the Nazi era, citizens have a moral responsibility to understand and embrace their history.By contrast, in Ireland, Scally sees a reluctance to analyse the past and to grapple with what the Church&rsquo;s overweening power did to Ireland. &ldquo;We have museums for whiskey, the GAA [Gaelic Athletic Association], the Famine, Jewish history, tenement life, James Joyce, leprechauns &ndash; but not for the most influential institution in Irish history.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the promised memorials to the victims of the Magdalene Laundries and other institutional abuses have yet to appear. Too many people would rather not talk about it. Scally ends this beautifully written and nuanced book with a powerful &ndash; and, I think, unanswerable &ndash; plea for Irish society to embrace much more openly and honestly the &ldquo;complex events in our contested Catholic past&rdquo;.</p> <p><em><span class="Apple-converted-space">This piece is from the New Humanist winter edition 2021. <a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>. </span></em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

              <h2><a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5914/a-study-in-failure#utm_source=rss">A study in failure</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Austrian writer Thomas Bernhard (Everett Collection Inc / Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/hd01jh.jpg" height="595" alt="Thomas Bernhard" width="864" /></p> <p>Books are frequently given and received as prescriptions: this one enlightens, that one cheers you up. Readers expect books to assist them in some way: to educate them, perhaps, or to deepen the moral sense. The books of the Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard might be recommended as prescriptions too. Only they function as purgatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Bernhard, who died in 1989, is famous for the bleakness of his outlook. From his first novel, <em>Frost</em>, published in 1963, to <em>Extinction</em> (1986), the novelist and playwright developed a distinctive style and mode of cultural critique. His works draw attention to, and then revel in, the unremitting cruelty of human relations and the pretentious futility of cultural life. It is through this effect that they achieve their purgative function, inviting us to cast out all our attachments.<br /><br />Most of Bernhard&rsquo;s novels are now available in English translation and readers have been purging themselves with them for some time. They have been joined at last by <em>The Cheap-Eaters</em>, one of his shortest. For years it was hard to come by, having long been out of print in its previous translation. Now issued in a new translation by Douglas Robertson, it has been published by Spurl Editions, a California-based press who describe themselves as specialists &ldquo;in works fitting for our current decrepit and apocalyptic world&rdquo;. <em>The Cheap-Eaters</em> has clearly found a good home.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Much of Bernhard&rsquo;s ire was directed against his own native Austria and was designed to make uncomfortable reading in that context. In his books, Vienna is a hateful place to live, representing the death of culture, along with the annihilation of art and intellect. Bernhard attacked Austria relentlessly as a country that he believed remained, following the end of the war, dominated by the twin spectres of Catholicism and National Socialism.<br /><br />It is tempting to read Bernhard&rsquo;s work biographically: this is the outlook of a man who was born illegitimately and whose father rejected him, who was schooled first by Catholic priests and then by Nazis (in his autobiography, he described school as &ldquo;a machine for the mutilation of my mind&rdquo;). Suffering from a chronic lung condition, he lived as a young adult among invalids, enduring botched medical interventions and the care of Catholic nuns. It is easy to see him as a tortured man, trapped in an ailing body, living with a death sentence and looking resentfully at the world around him. But this would do him an injustice. The themes in his work may be dark, but there is the sense that Bernhard is always there, in the background, laughing heartily at what he attacks. And besides, many of the themes covered in his work can be extended elsewhere. What makes Bernhard so persistently disturbing is that the world he depicts in his novels is often still recognisable, more than three decades after his death.<br /><br />One recurrent theme is that of intellectual obsession. Bernhard&rsquo;s obsessed intellectuals are great procrastinators. They have an epoch-making study in mind but never get down to writing it. Their commitment makes them ruthless to themselves and others, and because that work is never accomplished, there can be no possible justification for the pain it has produced.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>A project of this type appears in <em>The Cheap-Eaters</em>, where Koller, the main protagonist, spends the entire novel attempting to write his <em>Physiognomy</em>, a great work in which important observations regarding the imprint of world history and nature and personal experience will be revealed through the study of facial features. The cohort for this study are the &ldquo;cheap-eaters&rdquo;, a group of men who for years have sat at the same table in the Vienna Public Kitchen, ordering the cheapest meal available. The intellectual challenge Koller has set himself is considerable. In order to bring his study to completion, he must hold the &ldquo;entirety of nature and the entirety of the science of nature in his mind&rdquo;. This simply cannot be done, and so Koller sets himself up to fail.</p> <h2>'Confronted by the inanity of everything ever written'</h2> <p>Another important theme in Bernhard&rsquo;s work is the destruction of research subjects by their investigator, most brutally rendered in <em>The Lime Works</em>, published in 1970. A claustrophobic masterpiece, the novel follows the scholar Konrad and his disabled wife Zryd as they imprison themselves in an abandoned lime works near the Austrian town of Sicking. Konrad has them live there so that he can have the space, and peace, to begin writing his masterpiece, <em>The Sense of Hearing</em>. He submits his wife to his obsession with hearing, attempting to teach her to hear tiny variations in a phrase he mutters in her ear, each day, until she collapses with exhaustion. His lesson, which is also his experiment, ultimately fails, and eventually he ends it with a bullet.<br /><br /><em>The Cheap-Eaters</em> is interesting for subverting this trend. Koller studies his subjects but does not cause them pain or discomfort. However much he inspects them, they go on eating easily alongside one another. Furthermore, when he first arrives at the Vienna Public Kitchen, Koller finds that they do not subject him to the intrusive inspection that he normally receives as soon as his prosthetic leg is noted. They do not confront him, as Bernhard writes, with &ldquo;that common, squalid, and repulsive sort&rdquo; of look &ldquo;with which people like him are otherwise universally and incessantly confronted and to which they are exposed and subjected in the most vulgar and shameless fashion&rdquo;. This does not mean that the cheap-eaters do not inspect him at all. Actually, they submit him to a &ldquo;thorough and by no means squeamish inspection&rdquo; as he eats. They see him clearly, but they do not judge his &ldquo;crippled condition&rdquo; or ask him to justify his existence, nor do they extend him any sympathy. They merely assist Koller as he attempts to take his seat. This suits Koller&rsquo;s purposes perfectly, since his <em>Physiognomy </em>relies upon a similar gaze: an inspection of surfaces.<br /><br />One character in <em>The Cheap-Eaters</em>, Goldschmidt &ndash; a bookdealer &ndash; presents an interesting mini-case study of Bernhard&rsquo;s wider argument against the intellect. Committed to his work with books, he is also as a result confronted by &ldquo;all the abominableness and brutishness of human history&rdquo; that is contained within them. The bookdealer who takes books seriously &ldquo;is the most pitiable person in the entire human race&rdquo;, Bernhard writes, &ldquo;because day after day and uninterruptedly he is confronted by the absolute inanity of everything ever written and more than any other person he experiences the world as a version of hell&rdquo;. Language is itself irredeemable, from Goldschmidt&rsquo;s perspective. According to what Goldschmidt tells Koller, language consists &ldquo;of words of equal weight&rdquo; by which thoughts are &ldquo;incessantly weighed down and crushed&rdquo;.</p> <h2><span class="Apple-converted-space">Against language, against intellectual culture</span></h2> <p>These are intriguing claims: against language, against books, against intellectual culture. But as with his other novels, logical argument is not the vehicle of Bernhard&rsquo;s purging. Rather, through a reiteration and restatement of these claims, his writing offers its own peculiar respite. <span class="Apple-converted-space"><br /></span><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br /></span>Koller&rsquo;s <em>Physiognomy </em>is never written, of course, and <em>The Cheap-Eaters</em> remains first and foremost an account of intellectual failure. Koller is an interesting example of Bernhard&rsquo;s destroyed and destroying intellectual. Separated from others, existing superficially alongside his peers, he pursues his intellectual project with such diligent singlemindedness that he is unable to relate to other human beings. It is tempting to conclude that he cannot complete his Physiognomy because to study others, to speak of the human condition, is to account for the world intellectually. To do that is already to distort the world he perceives and to alienate himself from it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span><em>The Cheap-Eaters</em> is a magnificently annihilating little book. It presents an opportunity within the space of reading to become distant from the promises of intellectual culture that are made ever more insistently as they are betrayed. With Bernhard, the pleasure is in the purge.</p> <p><em>This piece is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfieldâs shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homerâs stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box. Â There is a Â need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with Â Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actuallyÂ <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth?Â Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This websiteÂ <em>isÂ </em>calledÂ <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here.Â <strong>Zero-hourÂ </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered.Â <strong>Zero-timeÂ </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would beÂ <em>teachingÂ </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertakeÂ <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;tÂ <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a>Â on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in oneâs area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesnât capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>Â· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>Â· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasnât yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouragingÂ <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are alreadyÂ <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages butÂ <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage,Â <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
