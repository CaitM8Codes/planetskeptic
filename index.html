            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">Yesterday, Mary startled a jumping spider which had been hiding under a mysterious small object. That object was also attached to the wall of our house by strands of spider silk. Is it an egg sac? I put it under the microscope, and no, it is not.</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/botanicalobject.jpeg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/botanicalobject-500x763.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="763" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-62343" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/botanicalobject-500x763.jpeg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/botanicalobject-98x150.jpeg 98w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/botanicalobject-197x300.jpeg 197w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/botanicalobject-768x1171.jpeg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/botanicalobject.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>It is something tiny, about 2mm long, and <em>botanical</em>. I know nothing of botany. It is not a spider thing, which is enough for me.</p>
<p>While I was in the lab anyway, I tended to the spiders, who are all doing fine. Here&#8217;s one just relaxing in a spider-like way.</p>
<p><span id="more-62342"></span></p>

<p>You can just see her dorsal-most eye peeking up between the thicket of legs to make sure I was up to no good. I also noticed that the seam on the dorsal midline of her abdomen was pulsing, something I&#8217;ve seen before.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s so easy to see and record and measure that I&#8217;m thinking this might be the start of an interesting student project &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a microscope stage warmer, we have ice, I have a laser temperature probe. It might be worth recording heart rate vs. temperature, especially since that&#8217;s a significant environmental factor around here. I&#8217;ve monitored spiders outdoors, and they start dying off if the ambient temperature gets down around -4°C, which corresponds to the temperature when some species go into dormancy. I may have to try it, if ever we get students working in the research labs again.</p>
<p>By the way, this particular spider may have molted just yesterday.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="lead">I used to appreciate Glenn Greenwald, back in the Bush years when he was a loud voice against the American war machine, defender of Chelsea Manning, etc. But then he got weird, and in his efforts to oppose the Establishment became increasingly aligned with what were fringe political perspectives that have since become mainstream Republicanism, and he never seemed to notice. <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/intercept-founding-editor-jeremy-scahill-calls-greenwalds-attacks-over-the-top-unnecessary-and-unjust/">He resigned from the Intercept because he thought they were neglecting marginal voices</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>On Thursday, Greenwald penned a lengthy resignation letter ripping the publication he helped co-found, saying it is “completely unrecognizable” from its creation in 2014.</p>
<p>“Rather than offering a venue for airing dissent, marginalized voices and unheard perspectives, it is rapidly becoming just another media outlet with mandated ideological and partisan loyalties,” Greenwald wrote on Thursday.</p></blockquote>
<p>So now, to avoid those &#8220;mandated ideological and partisan loyalties&#8221;, he has decided that the &#8220;marginalized voice and unheard perspective&#8221; he must support is that of&hellip; <a href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2021/03/punching-down-for-fascism">Tucker Carlson</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/Greenwald-tucker-.jpg"><img src="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/Greenwald-tucker--500x412.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="412" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-62338" srcset="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/Greenwald-tucker--500x412.jpg 500w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/Greenwald-tucker--150x123.jpg 150w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/Greenwald-tucker--300x247.jpg 300w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/Greenwald-tucker--768x632.jpg 768w, https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2021/03/Greenwald-tucker-.jpg 996w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see that I&#8217;m not the only one who has been dismayed by <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/10/30/what-happened-to-glenn-greenwald/">his strange and obvious rightward turn</a> &#8212; not just a turn, by a headlong rush into the arms of Carlson and Jimmy Dore and other pundits who try to pretend to be brave centrists while parroting the Republican party line.</p>
<blockquote><p>At this point, Greenwald seems to have almost no ideology besides reflexive contrarianism. Perhaps this is simply the end result of spending hours on Twitter every day for years, or spending two (or four?) years focused laser-like on the Russia inquiry. His incessant—and often finely detailed, and articulate—criticisms have transformed the man into a kind of fanatic.</p>
<p>More problematic, obviously, this tendency towards contrarian criticism has increasingly aligned him with the far right. Some of this can clearly be chalked up to the simplification of information within the context of social media; self-reinforcing media bubbles are created. But we pick our bubbles, and Greenwald appears to be comfortable with his niche.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the rhetorical overlap between Greenwald and the far right was always there, but could, in the past, usually be plausibly discounted as both-sides hostility towards a corrupt elite—consider the comparisons between Trump and Bernie. Or at least that’s how I felt. No longer. Take a look at Greenwald’s Twitter feed, which reads as an unending stream of right-wing grievance against cultural liberalism, and/or specific and almost exclusive amplification of right-wing media.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, he is just another media pundit with &#8220;mandated ideological and partisan loyalties&#8221; of the kind he deplored &#8212; and worse, he has incomprehensibly hitched his star to the wagon of Trumpism and far right conservatism. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s too bad, but after four years of incontrovertible empirical evidence that that political wing is incompetent and evil, I just have to say &hellip; screw him.</p>

<blockquote><p>New coronavirus cases in the United States continued to rise in the past week, jumping by as much as 12 percent nationwide, as senior officials implored Americans to stick to public health measures to help reverse the trend.</p>
<p>The seven-day average of new cases topped 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, according to data compiled by The Washington Post, while states such as Michigan, Vermont and North Dakota reported substantial spikes in new infections. The nation appeared poised for a fourth wave of illness even as vaccine eligibility is expanding in many states.</p>
<p>Michigan led the nation in new cases with a 57 percent rise over the past week. The state, which relaxed covid-related restrictions earlier this month, also reported the largest increase in coronavirus hospitalizations, which grew by more than 47 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The virus is still circulating everywhere. You&#8217;re swimming in it. The <a href="https://mikethemadbiologist.com/2021/03/26/we-have-never-understood-the-significance-of-prevalence/">prevalence is still high</a>, so even if you personally have been vaccinated, the virus still has tentacles of infection everywhere. We aren&#8217;t really safe until almost <em>everyone</em> is safe. Right now, I&#8217;ve got students going into quarantine and dropping out of our ongoing genetics experiment, and it&#8217;s not the kind of thing where you can take a few weeks to recover and pick up where you left off &#8212; the flies keep doing their thing whether you show up to analyze them or not. So I&#8217;m suddenly faced with a need to make all kinds of accommodations, and hope that enough students stay healthy that we can carry through to the end. This does not feel like the pandemic is over. It feels a lot like March of last year, when so many students were getting sick that we had to shut down the lab for the remainder of the term.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we got people like the Libertarians of Kentucky, who make odious comparisons between more pandemic safety and the Holocaust.</p>

But today, we're looking to the skies to hear an interview that you recorded Niki with science writer Jo Marchant. I'll be back to chat at the end of the show. So Niki, could you tell me a bit about Jo?</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Jo Marchant fascinates me because she seems to be a real polymath. She's an award-winning science journalist whose books have explored everything from the mystery of a 2000 year-old computer to Tutankhamun's Mummy, and the science behind the mind-body connection. She also has a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology and has worked at New Scientist and Nature. Her new book, <em>The Human Cosmos: A Secret History of the Stars</em> explores our relationship with the night sky and the cosmos beyond from prehistory to today. This journey through space and time is rich in historical and scientific interest. But she's also making an argument: she wants us to reconnect with the night sky and wants us to realize what we're missing by no longer looking up for inspiration. So when I met Jo, I asked her what drew her to write about the cosmos. She talked about the effect of awe - so was it the night sky that inspired her?</p> <p><strong>Jo Marchant: </strong></p> <p>Yes, it was a few different things. Actually, one was definitely an experience of the night sky. There's one episode that I mentioned in the book, when I was in Mexico on a completely different assignment, when there&rsquo;d been a big thunderstorm, I was camping in the mountains, and it had been a sort of a stressful day of risky travel &hellip; and then just being in this tent, not sure where I was or if I was going to get swept away, and waking up in the middle of the night, when the rain had stopped, coming out and looking up and seeing the stars, and being absolutely just transported by this incredible view. I think we see it so rarely - I live in London, so it's a city, and you know, I think we just forget how amazing this view of the stars is. It's not really part of our lives anymore. And then when you do see a properly dark sky, it's this mind blowing experience. And I was interested in, what have we lost? How has that been important through history?</p> <p>And the other reason why I wanted to do the book now was this feature of light pollution. We're the first society, civilization, that can't look up and see our Milky Way, our own galaxy, see the stars. So I wanted to know, what are we losing? How has that been important through history?</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Before we go into that, our relationship through time with the sky, what actually is the cosmos? Because I think the definition has changed through time, hasn&rsquo;t it?</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah. So the cosmos really is just everything really: reality. Everything that there is. The word originally is from this idea of order rather than chaos. Why is there something? Why is there order? What does it mean? What does it come from? So that's what I'm interested in sort of, fundamentally, you know, what is reality? And what does it mean? What's it made of? What's our relationship with it? But you know, here on Earth, our main window onto that wider reality, that wider universe, is the sky, you know: the sun, the moon, the planets, the stars, and it's those circling patterns through the sky, that would have been the first thing that gave people that sense that there is order, there are patterns. This isn't just a sort of chaotic existence, you can see those, those regular cycles in the sky. And that's always inspired and motivated people. So on one level, I'm looking at that view of the stars, how has it inspired people? What is it told us about this universe that we live in? But then on a deeper level: yeah, we've always looked to the sky and the stars to answer those deeper questions of what is reality. What is our existence? What does it all mean?</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And going back to the very beginning, as you do in your book, we sort of start our journey in the Lascaux caves in France. And those are caves that boast hundreds of Palaeolithic artworks. And your book explores these findings that suggest that those cave paintings - they're often of animals as well as people - might actually be depictions of star constellations. If that were actually confirmed to be the case, why would that discovery be important?</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, so I started with the cave paintings of the Palaeolithic because this is really the first insight we've got into the minds of our ancestors, when we first start to see this art and this creative expression. So you know that Europe is one place where we see wonderful paintings, the Lascaux cave, but there are others now being found from similar time periods in Indonesia, for example. So it's not just a European thing.</p> <p>But Lascaux cave is one of the places where you just see these stunning paintings of horses, bulls, stags, they're sort of floating across the walls and the ceiling of the cave. And yeah, there is one particular one that's very interesting. It's the biggest Oryx bull in Lascaux cave, it's known as bull number 18, and it's got this pattern of dots above its shoulder, and it's a very characteristic pattern. There's four in a line and then two in a line just above it. And you see that same pattern of dots popping up in art, all through history and around the planet. You see it in Native American art. You see it in the art of shamans in Siberia, you even see it in the logo of the Japanese car maker Subaru. And in all of these other examples, that pattern of dots is representing a star cluster, the Pleiades. So that's raised the question of, well, could the people of Lascaux have been actually painting the stars with these dots? And what makes it even more interesting is that the Pleiades is just above the shoulder of the bull in our modern constellation Taurus. And here they are in Lascaux cave just above the bull. So what I wanted to look at in that first chapter was, could that be true? Is there any evidence for this really being a star map? Could they have been painting stars? Could that link with a bull have survived? Until now? If it did, why would they have wanted to do that? And it is very difficult to say, for sure, what those ancient artists were thinking, you know, they didn't write down what they intended. So you have to kind of put together a patchwork of other different kinds of evidence, we don't know for sure. But yes, they could have been painting the stars, we could have inherited that story today. And the important thing I think it really says about the cosmos, that we first started off with, is that it was a very holistic, interconnected system. You know, we now separate earth and sky, ourselves and nature. But for the people back then it was just one system of nature, where things in the sky and earth just changed together.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And the history that you describe in the book, when we're learning about this history of our relationship to the cosmos, is a reminder of the extent to which scientific discovery is actually being driven by what we might now call like myths or superstition. Can you give us some examples of how what we would now deem to be superstition or myth that has actually driven essential or crucial scientific discovery?</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, so one thing I'm really interested in the book ... so I'm trying to tell this history of how the stars have been important. And I'm particularly interested in how have we built that powerful intellectual understanding of science. How do we move from a sort of mythological or stories-based understanding of what was going on around us to this scientific view, and one quite nice example is from the ancient Babylonians. So they were among the first civilizations to arise, we've got the first written records from around the third millennium BC and so you now you can see for sure, what were they thinking about the sky and there's an absolute obsession with what was going on in the heavens, like they took this holistic cosmos with events on earth and and the skies being entwined, really to extremes &ndash; that everything that happened, the planet changing in direction, or there's a lunar eclipse, they saw that as an omen, a warning from the gods. So they had teams of priests really, who would be watching the sky every night, writing down very carefully everything they saw that was happening, correlating that with events on Earth, coming up with sort of codified omens, what means what and rituals that you could conduct to stop the bad thing from happening. And because they did that, night after night, literally, for centuries, they started to realize that these movements in the sky aren't as chaotic and erratic as they had thought, that there's repeating patterns and cycles. And that is what really drove them to come up with mathematical ways of describing those cycles, which became more and more sophisticated over time, until they got to the point where they could actually predict with considerable accuracy where any celestial body was going to be, what was going to happen on any particular date. And that was the beginnings of a mathematical model of the universe.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And when you talk about reading omens in the sky and noticing patterns, is that what we would now call sort of early astronomy, and obviously, there's, there's early astronomy, and there's also religious and faith based inquiry as well. How do those relate?</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, that's an interesting question. Because now, yeah, we separate astronomy. So there's a scientific sort of mathematically based way of understanding the universe where we're sort of making numerical observations. And then there's astrology, which is more about meaning and stories and beliefs, and it's not based on scientific evidence, but those terms wouldn't really have made sense in the past, really, before the scientific revolution, certainly not for the Babylonians. So for them, the cosmos was absolutely a combination of those two things.</p> <p>So I think &hellip; we started off in the Palaeolithic where it's all about stories, beliefs, what people were experiencing in their environment around them, and they're experiencing these stars rising and setting in the sky and that's matching what's happening. The seasons that the Babylonians are coming up with, the mathematical models, but it's still absolutely this magical thinking, this belief. And the stories that they're telling. There's no separation between the two. And even then when you look at the ancient Greeks, astronomers like Copernicus or Ptolemy, or coming forwards to Kepler, or Galileo, these pioneers of scientific astronomy, they're still all keen astrologers, part of their motivation is they're trying to understand the human soul, they're casting horoscopes. So it wasn't really until Descartes, when there's that sort of separation between mind and matter, if you like, that the division between astronomy and astrology really made sense.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And moving on a bit in history, you quote Thomas Paine, the 18th century political thinker and revolutionary, whose writings on faith certainly didn't earn him any favours, and particularly when he called Christianity, quote, &ldquo;a parody on the worship of the sun in which they put a man who they call Christ in the place of the sun.&rdquo; But he was on to something, wasn't he? And why was that such a revolutionary thing to have said at the time?</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>So he was pointing out really, that with early Christianity, a lot of the beliefs and rituals around Christianity were based on existing pagan rituals to do with the worship of the sun. So you can look at worship on a &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo;, for example, or praying facing east to the rising sun. So you've got this sort of change, where instead of people worshipping many gods and the cosmos and the celestial body, now you've got monotheism, with one transcendent God, but he [Paine] was saying, well, it isn't really any different. So they're just, they've just taken over these, these previous rituals, it's just dressed up in different language. And so I think he was partly right about that.</p> <p>But also, I do think there was a difference, that when you had these monotheistic religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, it wasn't just a change from many gods to one, it was a change from worshiping what was within the cosmos. So we're seeing a living divine cosmos, if you like, to putting that God <em>outside</em> of the cosmos. Now you've got a supernatural God, and that the cosmos itself is a sort of passive creation of that supernatural God. And that did really change our relationship with the universe. And it also interestingly created that idea of kind of God's-eye view where you can step outside of the cosmos and look in on it and observe it. And that's, ironically, a viewpoint that's been really important to the development of science, that idea of a sort of third person, observer&rsquo;s view from somewhere outside of the universe. It's not a viewpoint that actually exists, but we sort of imagine it for the purposes of science.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And you mentioned particular religious figures who might have, sort of, maybe, origins as a sun gods, or maybe worshipped as sun gods. But you also make this broader point about how the order of the cosmos or the order of the planets have been used to justify a kind of order here on Earth.</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, this is a theme that I think is really interesting. And you see it all the way through human history, that knowledge of the heavens and people associating themselves with the cosmos and with celestial bodies, has always been used to justify political power. So even as far back as the Palaeolithic, anthropologists think that astronomical knowledge would have defined the elites, the people that were in charge, the people who knew when the winter solstice was going to happen, for example. And then through ancient civilizations, you've got these rulers who are associating themselves with celestial bodies, Roman emperors might associate themselves with Jupiter, for example, or the sun, you've got the Chinese Emperor as the son of heaven, the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, he is son of the sun, so they're, they're using that authority to cement their status. And it works really well, because it's very hard to question someone's authority, if it's just drawn from &lsquo;this is how the universe works&rsquo;, you'd have to question the whole cosmos.</p> <p>But I think it's interesting that still now, even though our beliefs and ideas about the universe have changed, after models of how the universe works, they are still important in our politics and our social structures. So one example that I look at in the book is with Isaac Newton, so when he came up with his universal law of motion (the idea that, you know, everything in the universe is sort of being bound by these the same physical laws or rules that revolutionized physics) he also helped to revolutionize politics, because the universe was there no longer this chaotic place where, you know, celestial bodies weren't divine beings that could move as they wanted to, you know, they, they were all bound by the same laws, you know, particles and planets. They all had to obey these physical laws of motion. And so people started to say, well, shouldn't that be true of people as well? Shouldn't everybody from communists to kings have to obey the same rules and those kinds of ideas were very influential during the Enlightenment, people who were talking about ideas to do with democracy and human rights.</p> <p>And so when people are talking about the role of governments as a check on the power of the king, for example, they using metaphors and language to do with gravitation and planets orbiting the sun, and then you've got the American and French revolutions, both very much influenced by these ideas as well. So you mentioned Thomas Paine before, he was a key person calling for revolution in America. And he was using arguments from Newtonian physics, for example, he was saying that, you know, because normally the planet is smaller than the sun that it revolves. But America is larger than England. So it shouldn't be a planet orbiting the central sun of England, it should be its own thing. And these ideas were really influential.</p> <p>And even after independence in America, the founders of the United States were using similar ideas to talk about how should they set up their new government, they wanted a balance of forces, which came from the idea of the balance between centrifugal and centripetal force keeping planet stable in their orbits that Newton talked about. And also, they had to come up with a new metaphor (they couldn't be, you know, like before, America was seen as a planet orbiting the central sun of England) where they can just be a planet, drifting in space now that they're independent. So they came up with the idea of a constellation of equal stars. And so with the American flag, you see, the states are represented as stars.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>That's been fascinating Jo. I had no idea that was the origins of the American flag. We're gonna take a short break now. And when we come back, we'll look at our relationship to the cosmos today.

Time for a word from my editor, Samira Shackle about something else that might appeal.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Prospect is Britain's leading monthly magazine of ideas, politics and culture. Their weekly podcast, the Prospect Interview, offers in-depth interviews with the brightest minds to discuss all the things that matter.

But what about now in the 21st century?</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>There's been a few quite fundamental shifts. So one, as you mentioned, is the development of our scientific understanding. So rather than looking to the heavens, and basing our understanding of what the universe is and our place within it on our first person experiences, what we can see, as scientists become more sophisticated, and we've developed more and more accurate measuring instruments, we've kind of shifted so that now our sort of state-of-the-art knowledge about the universe comes from these measuring instruments, from data, we've got these incredibly accurate telescopes that are probing the universe. And it's connecting us in in one way, we understand so much more about the physical universe than ever before, we can see so much further than our senses ever occurred. We understand, we have got ideas about the universe, starting in a Big Bang, we can start looking about where it might end, we know that most of the atoms in our bodies once came from stars. So I don't want to suggest that science completely separated us from the universe, it's many wonderful discoveries have connected us in lots of ways. But you do have this shift where that knowledge now is coming from these telescopes that no one actually looks through anymore. So that is just a change in where we get that knowledge and understanding. And that's great. But what worries me a little bit about that is that alongside that, what's happened is we've kind of downplayed the importance of our own experience and understanding. So we don't see, you know, our own connection with the stars, our own view of the sky is not really telling us anything sort of real or useful or important anymore.</p> <p>And then going along with that, the development of top technology. So, you know, we used to look to the sky to tell us about the passing of time, about navigation. And where we were. Now we've got clocks, we've got GPS, we've got electric lights and heating and intensive agriculture and jet travel. So we, we don't have to live in tune with the sort of cycles of the solar system anymore. We can live in a way that&rsquo;s separated from that. And that's given us a lot of freedom in how we live, a lot of convenience. But again, at the same time, it's separated us from that sort of direct connection with the universe around us. And there are several areas where scientists are actually saying that this separation may not be good for us. So I mentioned the, the biological clocks, for example, we now know that if you are not getting that right exposure to the changing patterns of light and dark, for example, that that's causing all kinds of health problems, that neuroscientists are looking at the effects of using satnav systems to navigate and showing that actually, that changes our brains. And with clocks, as we time everything more and more precisely, it's contributing to this phenomenon called psychological time famine, where people feel rushed all the time, right, they've never got enough time. So all of these things, I think, are telling us that the technology is great <em>but</em> if we allow it to separate us from our environment, that there are some downsides to that.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And you mentioned biological clocks and circadian rhythms. And obviously, our kind of reliance on electricity and electronic screens sort of taking us away from the rhythms of the sun. But you also said that probably the moon is influential as well. What kind of science is there behind that now?</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think the possible influence of the moon is really fascinating, because there's been lots of ancient beliefs and myths about the moon, especially relating to reproduction and fertility. And also there's this traditional link with the moon and madness. And this has been dismissed, I would say, by mainstream biology until fairly recently, there's been so many kind of pseudo-scientific claims and non-evidence based ideas about it, that it's kind of gained this veneer of wackiness, but actually scientists, particularly looking at marine species, for example, things like corals, fish, are finding that just as there are genetically encoded solar clocks (genes whose activity is varying every 24 hours with the sun), hundreds of genes are also varying in their activity with the moon. And obviously, that's really important for a lot of species that are living in the sea, you know, there's tidal species with the tides driven by the moon, but also species that spawn into the water. So they use the moon to be able to time that spawning so that they maximize the chances of fertilization.</p> <p>But actually, when you look on land as well, there are lots of species that have now been shown to use the moon in the timing of their reproduction, either in conception, or in birth. And then in people, trials on this have been controversial with mixed results. But quite a few researchers are now saying, well, that's probably because actually, we're no longer exposed to the natural changing patterns of moonlight. So it's not really surprising that you wouldn't see them. But when they're conducting studies specifically to sort of isolate this effect, and and try and look for it, there was one recent study showing that actually moonlight can entrain women's menstrual cycles. And there have been studies on sleep, suggesting that the phase of the moon influences quality of sleep, even when you've got people isolated in sleep labs. And so overall, people are saying: Well, actually, we know that there are these genetically encoded lunar clocks in really different species, vertebrates and invertebrates. And actually, it's a kind of an artificial distinction to say, well, there's the sun, which has an effect on the moon, which it doesn't from nature's point of view, it's just changing patterns of light. And these changes of light happen on a daily basis, but also with the moon and with the phases of the moon. So it would be that combined pattern of light that's influencing biology, we just don't tend to notice it now, because we're separated from the moon.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>I also wondered what you made of this resurgence of interest in astrology. And it's often from people who don't, they're not asserting that there is any kind of truth-based objective reality out there. A lot of the time, people are sort of looking at astrology as a therapeutic tool. It seems to be a trend, particularly among young women. So I wonder what you made of that as a trend. And if that's an attempt to sort of reassert our relationship to the cosmos in some way.</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, you're right. There is a really interesting trend there, particularly among younger people. And you're seeing a lot of astrology sort of online with different websites and apps. So it's quite different to the tabloid horoscopes that an older generation might be more familiar with. And what's interesting about that is, the fact that there's no evidence to support any of these astrological theories almost seems to be a selling point, that people are attracted to astrology not despite that, but almost because of it. It's kind of a reaction against a sort of overly reductionist physical view of the cosmos, where there isn't an important role for, for consciousness, for our experience for meaning and for belief. And I think people are reacting against that. Not necessarily dismissing a scientific-based view completely but wanting something else. And that's the attraction of astrology, where it's this more holistic view of the universe that we're part of, when meaning has a role to play that matters. I think we need to find a way to look at subjective experience and consciousness within a sort of scientific sort of worldview, if you like, rather than dismissing it, and then if we can accept that meaning and experience are important, then astrology won't necessarily have such a strong hold over people.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And there's many ways to reconnect with the sky. There's also been a trend of people buying telescopes and doing amateur stargazing. And I have to admit, I'm one of those people. My partner bought a small telescope not so long ago, and I've tried to use these stargazing apps. But I think, like you, I live in London, and you know, we're lucky to sort of get a few pinpricks of stars on a clear night. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on kind of that amateur stargazing and maybe even some tips that you might have about how, not only for us that live in cities, but people can sort of practically on their weekends, in their free time, just reengage with the night sky and the cosmos.</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I think there has been a real resurgence of interest, especially during the lockdown. I've spoken to astronomers and amateur astronomy organizations who said they've had a huge boost in interest. And yeah, just before coming on to tips, I just wanted to say a little bit about some of the research around what looking to the stars does to us. And this is something that psychologists call the emotion of awe, which they define as being the way that we feel when we're confronted by something vast, that dwarfs us, it&rsquo;s beyond our capacity to comprehend it. And researchers have found that all it really important, it makes people more creative, more curious, happier, less stressed, they become more generous afterwards, they make more ethical decisions, they care less about money, more about the planet. So it seems that if we're looking at something vast, it sort of shifts our attention away from ourselves and our own selfish daily concerns. And we feel more connected with something that's bigger. And that's supported by other studies showing that people sign their name smaller after feeling awe, they estimate their physical size as smaller. Neuroscience studies show that activity in the brain associated with our sense of self is reduced. So it's shifting people away from being obsessed with themselves. We see ourselves as part of something bigger, and that changes people's perspective. And the priorities and the decisions that they make. So looking to the stars, I think it's something that's really fundamental to what it means to be human. You know, we need the rational, scientific, detail-focused way of looking at the world, that's incredibly important. But the science itself is showing that actually, this bigger picture view, where we just look to the stars, is really, really important, as well. And yeah, I think that's one reason why it's so catastrophic, really, that we're losing our view of the heavens of the starry sky. 80% of people in Europe in the US can no longer see the Milky Way galaxy at all. So we've just lost that completely. I think a lot of people have forgotten what there even was, you know, we don't feel the loss of it, we just don't even notice the sky at all. And all the researchers have warned of what they call awe deprivation, the fact that we're all focused on small screens all the time, looking at our phones, not confronted by these vast horizons of nature, they've warned that as a society, that&rsquo;s making us more selfish and more materialistic and that we need to try and reconnect with, with awe.</p> <p>So in terms of how we can do that. I think dark sky reserves and parks are really important. But yeah, like, living in London, that's kind of not a daily solution. I think what you can see through telescopes is amazing. For a long time, I thought there wasn't any point but actually, over the lockdown, we've had sort of neighbourly get-togethers in the street when it's been allowed. And you can see, you know, the rings of Saturn, the moons of Jupiter. I really enjoy following the phases of the moon, actually, it sort of connects you to that monthly cycle, the moon sort of becomes almost like a familiar friend in the sky, you're noticing those changes. So I think there are so many things that we can enjoy, you know, even in a fairly light polluted sky.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>And now we're gonna look at the New Humanist archive piece that we sent to you to have a look at. And that's about another thing that we might look at the skies for, which is aliens. In that piece, so that was published in 2013, and it's called They Didn't Come From Outer Space. And in that, James Gray reviews an exhibition called Alien Revolution that was on at the Royal Observatory, about the changing perception of alien life and our search for the little green men, as he somewhat jokingly calls them. And James Gray is quite pessimistic in that piece about our sort of future prospects of finding alien life. And I just wondered what you made of that. And are we slightly more hopeful now than we were then?</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I noticed that in the piece, and it made me think quite a lot has happened since 2013! Yeah, what I thought was interesting that I completely agree with, he was picking out, was how there's been cultural changes through history in how people have viewed alien life and the possibility of finding it really has ebbed and flowed. So even as far back as Ancient Greece, there were philosophers, the atomists, who thought that everything was made up of little tiny particles or atoms, who concluded that there must therefore be infinite worlds. And then of course, on some of those worlds, you were gonna have alien life. But then you've got the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, which sort of really squashed that: it was much more about Earth being at the centre of the universe, and for centuries, this was strengthened by the Christian Church as well, this idea of a sort of corrupt, decaying Earth down below. And then the heavens was something completely different. It was this sort of perfect divine sphere of, you know, where the gods lived.</p> <p>But yeah, as, as James points out, once you've got Copernicus, who's putting the sun at the centre of the solar system, then you've got the Earth is just another planet, and the stars are other suns. And it sort of opens up this idea again, of other solar systems out there, and other aliens, perhaps living on those planets. And he talks about in the Enlightenment, for example, people were very interested in the idea of, of aliens. And yeah, after Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, yeah, this idea of not just sort of different kinds of humans living on other planets, but other types of species that would be sort of evolved in their own right. And then more recently, in the 20th century, there was kind of a dip in confidence about whether we were going to find alien life. So I have a whole chapter in my book, looking at this, and the sort of first scientific results that were coming in, it was looking like the moon and Mars were quite barren. And then when the Viking lander went there in the 1970s, again, there was mixed results. But the conclusion was, no, there's no life. And this was sort of seen as, okay, there isn't any life anywhere. And then even on Earth, as well, with the discovery of DNA, people thought, well, this, you know, the molecular kind of dance of life is so complicated, how could that possibly have arisen more than once?</p> <p>But since then, we've realized that actually, life is so resilient, it thrives in so many different places on Earth that we hadn't imagined. Then in the 1990s, you've got the discovery of the first exo-planets: that's, you know, another world in another solar system. And also, we've now discovered thousands of exo-planets, every possible different kind of planet you can imagine. I think there's an estimate that there's billions of Earth-sized habitable planets in our galaxy alone. So those more recent studies I think is what has changed since James wrote his piece, that it's not just a possibility. Now, it's like, we don't have direct evidence for alien life. But I think that if we try and break that down into smaller questions like: Could living things survive in space? Do we see the ingredients we need another planet? Are there other habitable earth like planets out there? All of those smaller questions, we're just seeing the answers coming back like: yes, yes, yes. I think it's just seeming more likely now than ever, that we're part of this sort of cosmic web of life, rather than being that only spark of existence in the universe.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Jo Marchant, author of <em>The Human Cosmos</em>, thank you so much for joining us. That was fascinating.</p> <p><strong>JM: </strong></p> <p>Thank you for having me.</p> <p><strong>NSS:</strong></p> <p>So now I&rsquo;m back with Samira who's been listening along to my chat with Jo. What I found great about Jo's work, and this is true both of <em>The Human Cosmos</em> book and her previous book <em>Cure</em>, is she's really good at looking at these more broad concepts that include myth and superstition and the mystical, but untangling that from the history of science and scientific discovery. I wondered what you took away from that conversation.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I was really struck by that too. I loved hearing her talk about mythos, cultural memory, and the sort of formation of early myths around the world and how that might relate to commonalities in the way people saw the stars and, and that kind of intersection between the mathematical and the scientific, and also the way in which those categories didn't really exist, then. That I found quite thought-provoking to just think about, you know, like today we obviously think of the superstitious and the scientific as being so obviously and clearly differentiated. But just the idea of those categories sort of developing over time as human knowledge. And the way we talk about human knowledge developed, I found really illuminating.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>There's also a section in the book when she's talking about the Lascaux caves. And she mentions that there was actually quite a lot of resistance to accepting that those cave paintings of animals and figures might actually be of star constellations. And that's a common theme throughout the book that there's resistance to maybe ideas that are conceived of as being a bit wishy washy.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>That was one thing I really enjoyed about listening to Jo speak was the way in which she, she seems quite rigorous about looking at these, as you say, maybe wishy washy ideas or things that don't seem to be rooted at all in the kind of evidential and looking at where there is evidence and where there isn't. I thought that too later in your conversation, when you were talking about the moon. And the idea of the moon being sort of related to fertility and different physical cycles, and sleep and menstrual cycles, and all those different things. I found it so fascinating to hear her talk about the obviously very early stages and not definitive yet, but there's studies that are being done on that in other species, and even in humans about sleep cycles, and so on. So I thought she did that really well, kind of walking the line between not giving too much credence to perhaps superstitious ideas, and really, actually thinking very seriously about where there is evidence.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>I was reminded in this layering of myth, and story and science, actually, on the stargazing app that I very recently downloaded, you have different modes. So you can see, you know, these sort of brilliant and amazing kind of, you know, the animals and figures of astrology, and then in a different mode, you actually see the constellation formations with their scientific names. But it's quite a lot to get your head around. It was nice to read the book and kind of have a little bit of context for what I'm very tentatively exploring sometimes in my garden when the weather is warm enough.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I was also thinking about the trend for astrology, which you asked her about is obviously something I've noticed as well, you see these kind of things that go viral, like adverts for flatmates that say, no Capricorns need apply, or whatever. So it was really fascinating to think about that in terms of this really long standing relationship to the skies above us. And they're looking for meaning.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, it's interesting that there are those two trends of amateur astronomy and also astrology going on at the moment. So yeah, I mean, maybe we can all learn a little bit from the book and put this in context of wider history.</p> <p>Next week, Samira will be talking to the author and poet Michael Rosen, about mortality, care, humanism, and more, as he tells us about his new book, Many Different Kinds of Love: A Story of Life, Death, and the NHS.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Remember, you can find transcripts and reading lists for all episodes of With Reason on the New Humanist website. And if you go to newhumanist.org.uk/subscribe and enter the offer code With Reason, you can get a year's subscription to the magazine for just &pound;13.50. That means you'll get a beautiful quarterly magazine and access to our whole digital archive.</p> <p><strong>NSS: </strong></p> <p>This podcast was presented by me, Niki Seth Smith, with Samira Shackle. The executive producer was Alice Bloch and the sound engineer was Dave Crackles. See you back here soon, goodbye.</p> <h2>Further reading:</h2> <ul> <li>&lsquo;The Human Cosmos: A Secret History of the Stars&rsquo; (2020) Jo Marchant</li> <li>&lsquo;Cure: A Journey Into the Science of Mind Over Body&rsquo; (2016) Jo Marchant</li> <li>&lsquo;The Order of Time&rsquo; (2017) Carlo Rovelli</li> <li><a href="/articles/4139/they-didnt-come-from-outer-space">&lsquo;They Didn&rsquo;t Come From Outer Space&rsquo; (2013) James Gray, New Humanist Magazine</a></li> </ul>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

              <h2><a href="https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5773/australias-dance-with-death#utm_source=rss">Australia's dance with death</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="New South Wales firefighters conduct a controlled burn before the bushfire season begins, September 2020" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/oz.jpg" alt="oz" /></p> <p class="p1">When I was growing up in 1980s and 90s Australia, the film <em>Wake in Fright</em> had an almost mythological status. The master negative of this psychological thriller, made in 1971, had gone missing, and it had developed a cult status as Australia&rsquo;s great lost film. It<em> </em>follows a young schoolteacher who descends into moral degradation after finding himself stranded in a menacing town in outback Australia.</p> <p class="p3">In 2002, a print of the film was found in Pittsburgh, in a shipping container marked &ldquo;For Destruction&rdquo;. Restored, it was selected by Martin Scorsese to be shown at Cannes in 2009. He called it &ldquo;a deeply &ndash; and I mean deeply &ndash; unsettling and disturbing movie&rdquo;. <em>Wake in Fright</em> was back.</p> <p class="p3">One scene from the film has gained particular notoriety. The hero of the film is John Grant &ndash; a schoolteacher who ends up in a fictional outback town after losing all his money gambling. The men have been drinking all day, and now that it&rsquo;s night they&rsquo;re going kangaroo shooting. The kangaroo, dazzled by bright light from the car, stands still and allows itself to be shot. But the true test of a man is to get down from the four-wheel drive and fight a giant male. It wants to kick your chest and stop your heart. You only have a knife to fight back with. Grant watches on as the black night is illuminated by the flashing of white light, and as roo after roo is shot, spins on its tail and drops covered in blood. The carnage is relentless and he cannot look away, and neither can we. One of his companions leaps down and takes on a giant, grabbing its tail, pulling it close and cutting its neck to the cheers of his mates.</p> <p class="p3">Grant volunteers to take the next roo. He gets down from the jeep, approaches, knife in hand. The lights flash, he lunges, we see him grabbing the tail. He grapples with the animal, loses his grip, regains it, tries to pull it close, struggles, holds its tail again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to dance with it,&rdquo; roar the men. Grant stares at the knife in his hand, then drives it into the roo again and again, as the men laugh.</p> <p class="p3">The scene is graphic &ndash; it shows a real kangaroo hunt, where kangaroos were actually killed &ndash; and it is partly the level of violence which made it so controversial. But this dance, showing man against nature, also speaks to something deeper about Australian national identity.</p> <p class="p3">While Europe has its wild places, the sheer scale of Australia and the way that the untamed territory of the interior impacts upon daily life have no equivalent. Australia is the 55th largest country in the world by population, but only Mongolia, Western Sahara and Suriname have fewer people per square kilometre. Drive more than a few hours inland in most parts of the country, and you are in either bush or desert. This idea of man dancing with and seeking to dominate nature has informed the western relationship to settlement in Australia from its beginnings to today &ndash; starting with the very first arrival of European explorers in 1770 and the subsequent attempts to important western farming methods and subjugate the indigenous population, right through to the immense bushfires which swept through vast swathes of territory in early 2020. Australia&rsquo;s dance with nature is rapidly becoming a dance with death.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">In 2020 the Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia as the worst country in the world in terms of national and international climate change policy. Its carbon emission levels in 2019 were the highest in its history, and its current 5 per cent contribution to global greenhouse emissions is forecast to hit 17 per cent by 2030. In 2019, the United Kingdom generated half its electricity from low carbon energy. In Australia, it is just above one-fifth. The report said Australia is a &ldquo;regressive force&rdquo; when it comes to the climate.</p> <p class="p3">These regressive policies continue in the face of immediate and concrete environmental catastrophes. In the summer of 2019-20, enormous bushfires swept across some 46 million acres, with 34 human fatalities and the death of an estimated billion animals. Bushfires are a yearly occurrence, but these were on an entirely different scale. The 900 million metric tonnes of carbon emissions from the 2019-20 fires are equal to the emissions caused by all commercial aircraft flights in an average year.</p> <p class="p3">Dwindling water supplies, combined with rising sea levels and an increasingly overheated climate, are already having devastating impacts on large areas of the country. Temperatures as high as 68C have been measured in Central Australia, while Sydney hit 48.9C in January 2020. And the process is accelerating. Australia has already exceeded the most pessimistic predictions given by the government scientists in 1992 on temperature rise by 2030. The dramatic expansion of coal mining plays a huge part in this &ndash; as the world moves towards renewables, Australia&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels continues to grow.</p> <p class="p3">There is a real possibility of environmental refugees from Australia &ndash; a country with some of the most draconian refugee policies in the world. Australia may become one of the first countries in the world to become uninhabitable.</p> <p class="p3">What remained baffling to many outside Australia during the fires was the attempt by the current government to downplay and even deny the causal relationship between the fires and climate change. While responses are sluggish throughout the world, there is an increasing consensus that climate change is real, and needs urgent mitigation. Most governments at least pay lip service. Australia&rsquo;s current leaders, by contrast, have not simply ignored the growing evidence, but actively encouraged the idea that to be pro-environment is to be un-Australian.</p> <p class="p3">In breaking with the increasing international consensus, Australia is drawing on a long history of treating nature and the environment as instrumental, either as something to be overcome &ndash; for instance by the imposition of imported, inappropriate farming methods &ndash; or something to be exploited, as the current devotion to coal shows. In many ways, the Australian psyche builds itself and sustains itself in opposition to the facts.</p> <p class="p3">It is no stretch to say that looming environmental collapse in Australia is intimately linked with its colonial history. If not all of Australia&rsquo;s national identity can be explained by these acts of subjugation, the pattern of climate change denial is a recognisable one in a nation in many ways built as a riposte to climate itself.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">Even before it was first encountered by Europeans, Australia existed as a part of the Western imagination, an &ldquo;overthere&rdquo;, marking the boundary of knowledge. As far back as 344 BC, Aristotle, arguing that the Earth is spherical, suggested that both water and land would need to be distributed equally around the globe. The second-century mathematician Ptolemy required a southern land to balance the Earth of his geocentric <br />universe. This land, <em>Terra Australis</em>, appeared in the first printed versions of Ptolemy&rsquo;s works during the Renaissance, as well as on a 1533 globe made by German mathematician Johannes Sch&ouml;ner. He wrote that it is:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p7">an immense region toward Antarcticum, newly discovered but not yet fully surveyed. . . The inhabitants of this region lead good, honest lives and are not cannibals like other barbarian nations; they have no letters, nor do they have kings, but they venerate their elders and offer them obedience; they give the name Thomas to their children [after St Thomas the Apostle].</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">While the Thomas theory remained untested, others speculated that this was Plato&rsquo;s Atlantis, re-risen and filled with all the animals that featured in myths and legends. The report which inspired the British government to sponsor Captain Cook&rsquo;s expedition conjectured that it was a land of 50 million people, from whence the Incas had left to go to Peru. There were not, however, 50 million Incas awaiting Cook&rsquo;s arrival on 26 January 1770. According to current estimates, the indigenous population was around 750,000 at the time, widely dispersed across the landmass of nearly 8 million square kilometres. The territory Cook set foot on, although he was not to know it, was Wangal land. Its people were custodians of the area around Sydney for at least 20,000 years &ndash; although evidence of human settlement in other parts of Australia goes back 60,000.</p> <p class="p3">The Wangal are one of over 500 different nations with widely diverging cultures and languages spread across the continent. In one sense, Ptolemy was right &ndash; the disparate cultures and clans of the Northern Hemisphere did have an equivalent in the South. That they were lumped together and designated &ldquo;aborigines&rdquo; &ndash; the empty term for any &ldquo;person, animal or plant that has been in a country or region from earliest times&rdquo; &ndash; is the first conceptual violence that would be carried out on them.</p> <p class="p3">Actual violence soon followed. &ldquo;Savages&rdquo; were not regarded as human, and therefore had no claim on their own land. While there is little doubt that there were political and military motives for colonisation, during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Europe the idea of the savage &ndash; noble or otherwise &ndash; was hugely influential, culturally, philosophically and scientifically. &ldquo;Primitive man&rdquo; was used as an antinomy for the civilised: sometimes romanticised, as in Rousseau and Montaigne, but more often given as examples of what remained animal in the human (Kant), and what remained anarchic in political and social systems (Hobbes). That indigenous Australians were denied the vote &ndash; and thus citizenship &ndash; until 1967 is a monument to the designation of the aborigine as sub-human. Darwinism introduced a hierarchy of the human; in Social Darwinism that hierarchy could be engineered, by extermination or assimilation.</p> <p class="p3">A 2019 <em>Guardian</em> investigation identified 270 massacres of the indigenous population between settlement and the late 1920s. By then assimilation was also in full swing, including the forcible removal of indigenous children from their parents. Instigated in 1869 with the Victorian Aboriginal Protection Act, the policy continued until 1970 in various forms. Aboriginality, it was hoped, could be bred out: lighter skin increased one&rsquo;s chances of adoption. As the 1937 Conference of Commonwealth and State Aboriginal Authorities put it in its report on Aboriginal Welfare: &ldquo;the policy of the Commonwealth is to do everything possible to convert the half-caste into a white citizen.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Simultaneously, the indigenous population was being dispossessed of its land. The weirdness of Australia&rsquo;s initial establishment as a penal colony was replaced by the weirdness of European farming methods being transplanted wholesale onto a land without pastures. The invention of automated looms exponentially increased the need for wool. Soon sheep were being exported to the continent instead of convicts, and between 1846 and 1865 the export of wool from Australia to the UK increased five-fold. Australia became the biggest wool producer in the world.</p> <p class="p3">Early settlers and those who followed replaced native vegetation with shallow-rooted crops. This led to huge tracts of Australia becoming barren salt plains. According to a 2010 government report, 14 million acres of land is almost impossible to reclaim for agricultural use, a number expected to rise to 42 million acres by 2050. The same report notes that in the Western Australian wheat-belt, salinity has halved the numbers of wetland bird species, while 450 plant species are threatened with extinction.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">If the gold rush is the headline event of early Australian history, coal has had the greater and more sustained impact. Although not mined until 1850, when it was, it rapidly turned Australia into one of the largest producers and exporters of the fossil fuel in the world.</p> <p class="p3">Currently, Australia exports 29 per cent of the world&rsquo;s coal, in dollar terms more than double that of its nearest competitor, Indonesia, and four times as much as the United States. Generating 29 per cent of Australia&rsquo;s carbon emissions, coal has made a major contribution to the country having the largest per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the western world. This is set to increase.</p> <p class="p3">The continued &ldquo;success&rdquo; of the mining industry in Australia is not an accident. Rather, it is the result of a media and lobbying campaign spending mind-boggling sums. In the past decade, it&rsquo;s estimated that the Australian mining lobby has spent AUD$541 million on advertising and political access. Some $22 million alone was spent in 2010 against then prime minister Kevin Rudd&rsquo;s carbon tax scheme, dwarfing the government expenditure. Over 20 per cent of corporate donations to political parties between 2015 and 2017 were by mining companies. Mining magnate Gina Rinehart, owner of 24 million acres of mining land (the size of Hungary), donated $4.5 million to the Institute of Public Affairs, which regularly publishes books and articles arguing against the reality of climate change.</p> <p class="p3">This spending has been instrumental in convincing a large swathe of the Australian population not only that the mining industry is vital to its economy, but that all environmental issues are, in fact, economic issues &ndash; and that the environment and the economy are in opposition. To be against mining, then, is to be against the economy, and to be against jobs. It is to be un-Australian.</p> <p class="p3">As the government expands coal mining, the media has acted as a cheerleader for the industry. Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s Newscorp owns between 60 and 70 per cent of the Australian news media. Kevin Rudd has described the relationship between Murdoch and the coal industry as &ldquo;umbilical&rdquo;.</p> <p class="p3">This reframing of the environment as the enemy of the economy is reflected in public perceptions. A recent report asked Australians what percentage of workers were employed in mining; the average answer given was 16 per cent. In reality, it is 1.9 per cent. People estimated that mining contributes 35 per cent to GDP. The reality is 9.2 per cent. And mining doesn&rsquo;t even benefit the national economy on the scale that it is portrayed as doing. When asked what percentage of mining is foreign-owned, the answer given was 53 per cent. In reality it is 83 per cent. Despite large protests, in June 2019, the federal government approved the construction of what will be one of the world&rsquo;s largest coal mines. If the mine &ndash; owned by India&rsquo;s Adani &ndash; were a country, by itself it would be the 36th highest emitter of CO2 in the world, one place ahead of Kuwait. The company was awarded numerous tax exemptions and subsidies.</p> <p class="p3">Things show little chance of changing under the current administration. In 2017, the then-treasurer Scott Morrison brandished a lump of coal in parliament, yelling: &ldquo;This is coal. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Don&rsquo;t be scared.&rdquo; Those arguing for stricter climate controls have, Morrison argued, an &ldquo;ideological and pathological fear of coal&rdquo;. Like the drunks urging John Grant to dance with the kangaroo, he was appealing to a version of Australianness which marks opponents as cowards. Morrison is now prime minister.</p> <p class="p5">For how long is this sustainable? As with neurosis in an individual&rsquo;s psyche, a neurosis in the psyche of a nation can battle on, impervious to the facts. The facts themselves can increase resistance. The temperature in Australia continues to increase. Globally, we are moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy, which means markets will shrink. The dance becomes ever more unsustainable. Will it burn itself out before Australia does? Without a radical change, the answer is no.</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

And why does language matter when we talk about illegality, &lsquo;foreign criminals&rsquo; and belonging? A conversation about borders and belonging, exclusion, citizenship and listening.

It's the place to explore questions of reason and unreason. belief and disbelief, criticism and debate.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>So far this series we've heard from Katherine Angel, whose latest book challenges the dogma on desire and consent. We've also talked to Rosie Hancock about politics and religion, and how the relationship between those two things is often subject to unhelpful stereotypes. But today, we have an interview that you recorded Alice, with Luke De Noronha: about borders, belonging and deportation. I'll be back for a bit of a chat at the end of the interview. But for now, could you tell me a bit about Luke.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>So yeah, Luke's lecturer in race, ethnicity and postcolonial studies at UCL in London, and his work intervenes in debates to do with race and migration in the UK. Like other sociologists, who we've already had on With Reason, his work really involves talking to people and getting out there and situating their stories in broader social and political processes. ones I guess, that some people would rather pretend didn't exist at all. In the case of today's subject, that's the effects of immigration control and broader racism on people's lives. His new book <em>Deporting Black Britons: Portraits of Deportation to Jamaica</em> tells the stories of four men who grew up in the UK, were deported to Jamaica after criminal conviction, and now struggle to survive and rebuild in the Caribbean. When I talked to Luke, I asked him what made him want to research this issue. And what drew him to Jamaica specifically?</p> <p><strong>Luke De Noronha: </strong></p> <p>I suppose the first thing to say is that this research was a part of my PhD. And I had been thinking about issues around racism in the UK, and also at the same time, working with migrants and refugees in Bristol. And I was engaging with people who were living under the threat of deportation. And then the focus really became on foreign offenders after my master's research, which was kind of on the finger of the foreign criminal, who was discovered in 2006. And became a kind of folk devil in the UK context, kind of ultimate baddie. And from the mid noughties, 2006 onwards, increasing numbers were being detained indefinitely and being deported. And so I wanted to meet people after they'd been deported in this situation. So that came first, that focus on the person who's been criminalized in the UK, who's perhaps been here since they were a child, and who doesn't have citizenship and who then finds himself facing deportation or exile. And Jamaica then became a fitting place because quite a lot of people were deported under those terms. And because there was an organization they're working with, involuntarily returned migrants, they call them, I was able to contact them and work that way, work through an organization in Jamaica, and go out there and just start trying to meet people.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>I can imagine that, that when people heard that you're heading to do research in Jamaica, you might have got a few comments or a few jokes about relaxing on the beach, or that kind of thing. You're nodding your head. You know, it's somewhere that that quite a lot of people in the UK might think of as a holiday destination. And actually you talk, of course, about the darker side of things, deportation to that country. I know that there is some news coverage, not enough, of charter flights when it comes to deportation. But one of the things that you mentioned that I was really amazed to learn in your book is that some people are deported to Jamaica and elsewhere, you know, Albania, for example, on commercial flights. So if I understand correctly, you might be going on holiday, and someone on that same flight is being deported. That's an image that quite neatly represents some of the contrast that you want to capture in your book. That contrast in terms of people's abilities, who's free and unfree? Who has money and opportunity, who doesn't?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Commercial flights were the main way in which people were deported to Jamaica over my time, over my research. The news around charter flights has been in part - it really emerged most most vocally in response to the Windrush scandal. There were a couple of protests around charter flights when they were resumed. But the UK's main approach over the last 10 years has been commercial flights to Jamaica, and globally. So Virgin Atlantic had a contract with the Home Office to deport people on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday for all of the time I was going to Jamaica, between 2015 and 2017. And long before. So that was the way in which most of the people I met were deported. So those people will be put on the flight first. And you know, there are international regulations about how you manage people being deported. And how the air companies manage them, how the escorts will take people on, sometimes with restraints, before the tourists or the family travelers get get on the plane. So I think that is a stock image, just as the charter flight is a stock image of, you know, a group of people being being detained and forcibly forced onto a plane in the middle of the night and trying to make desperate last calls to lawyers and families - just as that is a particularly stark image. I think the point you make about the people saying, you know, you can have a holiday, is interesting because I felt that people either said, the majority said, "Oh, you've done well, there, you've got your fieldwork in the Caribbean". It's not totally untrue. And then other people would say, "oh, are you going to be alright, you know, is it dangerous for you". I felt there was something missing from both, on both accounts, it was neither of those things. It was something else.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>We'll talk more in a bit about the four men whose lives you depict, all of them, I think born between 1986 to 1992, which I guess puts them in a similar age bracket, probably to you and me. And you evoke, as we were just talking about their re Jamaiev, you know, the kind of nuances of their lives of these men, Jason, Domenico, Ricardo, and Chris, you talk about them all very much as individuals, but you also situate their experiences within bigger social, structural political processes. So tell me in simple terms, what these four men have in common in the eyes of the law of the British state?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Well, in the eyes of the law, at least, except Jason, they were all deported rather than removed, which is a specific form of enforced return in immigration law, which basically means the Home Office say that your deportation, your removal is conducive to the public good, which normally means you've been defined as someone with a criminal record. It can also be used for national security cases. But in my case, it's basically deportation is for criminals. So all of the people had offenses, Jason was removed rather than deported because the Home Office can choose sometimes. So they would have all been defined as foreign criminals. Listeners may have kind of come across this around the time of the charter flights, successive home secretaries have said, you know, "everyone on the flight is a serious foreign criminal, and therefore, they're being deported under automatic deportation", which is a bit of legislation brought in by new labor in 2007. Precisely after that foreign prisoner crisis I mentioned, to try and expedite the removal of anyone, no matter how long they've been here, who's got a record, who's not a citizen, and I call the book <em>Deporting Black Britons</em> to sort of play on that. People who've been here for a long time, perhaps born here, or since they're very young, who faced deportation because of the Home Office's change of policies, which tried to deport anyone labeled a foreign criminal. So they have that in common. And then, of course, they have in common experiences of poverty, experiences of precarious immigration status, experiences of racist criminal justice, experiences of difficult family relationships, like is true for many people who end up in prison. But of course, they are unique individuals with very different stories. And I suppose some of the important differences are not only the individual personalities, but also you know, whether they had leave to remain, and at what time they had leave to remain, as against when they were convicted of offenses. And those two things interact in different ways in different people's lives. Some people might never have their status and therefore might commit immigration crimes or commit crimes like selling drugs, because they can't work legally, whereas others might actually have their stay, they might be able to access the same meagre welfare benefit system as British citizens, but then find themselves convicted of an offence and lose that status on the basis of the crime. Exactly. I suppose the men in my book were deported before the hostile environment really came into force, around the time that it was coming into force. I suppose to understand the hostile environment, we have to go back to Theresa May's role as home sec. When she said in 2012, "these policies are designed to create a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants". She used those terms and, and what that was, is an extension of some powers, we might call them internal borders, where everyone was expected to check and be checked and bordering functions were outsourced to doctors, to employers, to landlords, and to all of us really in many ways. So now we're used to it, you know, you rent a house or you start a job and you have to show your passport. Now, you might have to show your passport on Zoom just to an employer, but that was kind of consolidated under the 2014 Immigration Act, all of these internal border checks. And what that meant then, was that people who were gatekeepers to public services were border agents, and that people who might not have had their stay, were restricted from accessing various services, you know, pregnant women being charged &pound;7000 for what's considered a normal birth and things like that. Landlords not renting to people with foreign sounding names, various forms of discrimination, but also just violence against people who were undocumented or undocumented. And so the Windrush scandal are a group who you might say is under-documented, they technically should have had a right of abode because they arrived before 1973 - but had no evidence. And so for the Windrush, it was proving that you really did arrive before 73. And people basically face getting letters, saying, you know, the Home Office is pursuing your removal because you try to claim benefits or because you went to the hospital and you don't have the right papers.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And deportation takes place against the backdrop of the hostile environment. And that term refers to a set of policies that came in around the middle of the last decade, designed to exclude illegal immigrants. And that's the phrase you use in quote marks, basically people without the paperwork from public services and kind of a detection through data sharing, and that kind of thing. That all came under scrutiny when the Windrush scandal began to surface in 2017. Can you recap that for us and the sentiment that it stirred? Because I know, leading on to my next question, that you want to contrast that and the outrage that was reserved for the victims of the Windrush scandal with the kind of lack of attention and sympathy for the deported men who depict in your book? And contrasting that, though, with the men in your book, you say that those people have been kind of treated with I think, with less sympathy because they are labeled as foreign criminals, again, a term that you use in quote marks.</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Always in quote marks for that one. I mean, I think the thing I was struck by was that the Windrush migrants were folded into a national story about how Britain is actually a tolerant and hospitable place to the right people. Every minister talking about migration starts with, Britain has a long history of welcoming refugees - which is just not true. Discourse on migration is always a sort of morality play, where you say that, of course, we respect the rights of the people who deserve them. But we have to be serious about having control and having the right measures. That's what everyone says -whether any party - and what happened with the Windrush scandal is, they became a group who deserved rights. And they proved then, for the Daily Mail or Jacob Rees Mogg, they proved that there was a lack of common sense and a lack of control and that the human rights judges and lefty lawyers were giving the wrong people, all these protections to the criminals, but they were making destitute and deporting honorable, old, hardworking Windrush migrants who helped build the country after the war. And it was, you know, I mean, Jacob Rees Mogg described the scandal as fundamentally un-British and the Daily Mail were outraged. We have to be very cautious when these kinds of far right figures are saying that the Windrush scandal have been harmed. And that's because it was folded into a particular national story, which is not to say great wrongs weren't done to those who were subject to those policies. But it is to say that what it was politically was to say, these people are part of the nation, they are citizens, and they are not illegal immigrants. They've been treated wrongly as illegal immigrants; the real illegal immigrants are those asylum seekers arriving by boats. And they're those offenders. They're criminals. They're terrorists. They're Muslim radical clerics. Young gangsters. They're Romanian cash machine thieves. They're what I mean. The list can go on and on.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>So it basically set up this this very damaging binary that you want to undo. And it seems what you're getting at is this idea that really there's a problem with this word "scandal" - in framing one thing as a scandal, quite rightly, the Windrush scandal, you nonetheless tend to normalize other things that are actually also not okay, in your view. So deportation, for example, that part of the whole same picture, but by picking one thing as the exception, you risk normalizing or minimizing the rest.</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Exactly. I mean, actually, I hadn't thought about that til you picked up on the word scandal there. But my work starts with the foreign prisoners scandal in 2006, and I guess, to think about them as bookends to - so once, both scandals lead to the Home Secretary resigning or being fired, and what both of those, the word scandals do is say the Home Office has lost the plot, which is not the point. It is not that the Home Office has lost the plot and is policing the wrong people. The point is that the policies and the laws are cruel and inhumane.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Well, sticking on language, then for now, you already mentioned you do always use this term foreign criminals in quote marks, and you choose to speak of people who have been criminalized. And also you talk about people who have been legalized so criminalized rather than criminal and illegalized rather than illegal? Just tell me a bit why you choose to use that that "ised" suffix on those words, What are you getting at?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>I suppose it's trying to denaturalize, unsettle the taken-for-granted-ness of the noun, basically, the human type of the person who is criminal.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>I mean, so they're not born a criminal.</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Exactly. I mean, some people think you are born criminal, but those people are racist eugenicists and that is partly the history of criminal law, of criminology, of criminal thought that certain people are inherently criminal. And I'm not saying that everyone who says "criminal" thinks that, but they do think that, fundamentally, the individual has conducted themselves in such a way or committed a series of acts that mean that they can be called the noun, the criminal, a criminal. But when you think about the various ways in which people break the law, and the uneven ways in which some people end up being labeled criminal, or you think about the various ways in which people or institutions or social structures do harm to various people, and then those who get labeled a criminal and get put in prison, none of those things match up very well. We know this from corporate crimes or institutional crimes or gendered violence, we know that the vast majority of those responsible for such social harms don't end up being called criminal. And so it's in a way, it's to kind of unsettle the state's power to classify, to categorize, to label people, and then to act with the full force of its coercive power against those people deemed criminal.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Staying on this idea of criminalization, I think you say, to paraphrase, pretty much all of us break the law almost all the time, in some way, but really, what criminalization is about, especially when it's interacting with racism, is about who is more likely to be pulled into the spotlight, and why. And you tell the story of Ricardo, again, I don't know if that's his real name or not (I know, people in this book are anonymized), who describes experiencing extensive surveillance and police harassment, in his account, as a teenager in the West Midlands. And that was despite the fact that, at that point, he hadn't actually committed any crime at all. That story seems to illustrate quite neatly, this point you're making about criminalization.</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Ricardo's story was really troubling for me, because I first went to Jamaica knowing and being schooled in a kind of anti racist knowledge of disproportionality in the criminal justice system, but to actually hear a young person who wasn't necessarily schooled in that language, just describe the weight of policing in his life as a teenager, just being 14 and 15 and starting to realize that if you go outside and walk to the shop, or hung around in the parks, that the police are going to stop you, and often arrest you. He was arrested over 100 times, by the time we reached 18. He was arrested all the time, and always suspected of robberies. And of course, there may have been instances of crime in the parks where he was hanging out, there may have been people he was hanging around with who had criminal records, the police deemed him part of a problem family, he was black and hanging around with black and Asian friends mostly. And he justbegan to feel like whenever he left his house, he was gonna get pulled by the police, gonna get stopped. There's no other way to describe it, than as racist, punitive over-policing, of a young person who, again, yeah, of course, will have smoked weed, or might have done some graffiti on the bus stop and things like that, but actually had not committed any offenses. And I choose to believe him. And people can talk, we can talk about ethics, and all of those things. I believe him as a friend now.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>So the thing that Ricardo was convicted for, eventually, if I'm right, was burglary, or being involved on the periphery of a burglary that involved a group. Can I ask what sort of things the man you spoke to did have convictions for, just briefly? I ask this, because, obviously, there is a lot of media attention on this idea of the foreign criminal, and looking at a Home Office factsheet from November last year about one charter flight, they're very keen to stress there that this flight has offenders on it, who have committed crimes like murder, rape, violent crime. Were the men you talked to in those kind of categories, crime-wise, or was it other smaller offenses, I'm assuming that these guys were involved with?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>So yeah, Ricardo had a burglary offense. Again, I would say that he was unfairly treated in the criminal justice system and disproportionately punished. There are a couple of street robbery offenses of people I met. Drugs would be definitely the main one. And data from the Jamaican side said that in 2013, half of those deported as criminals from the UK were for drug offenses, so we can then think about drugs policy and who takes drugs. And if we're thinking about disproportionality in who's policed, then of course, young black men might be selling white middle class people drugs, for example. So there's a whole question there about about drug policy and what we what we're doing and the waste of life involved.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>But to clarify the four men whose stories you focus on in your book, we're not talking there about murder, rape, violent crime.</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>No, no. We're talking about street robbery and drugs offense for one. We're talking about the burglary. The other one was a drug offense of someone who had no status. And the other one was actually a series of very petty crimes. That was Jason who was homeless.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>You're listening to With Reason.

Whatever your beliefs, you'll find something in our pages to stretch and change your mind.

Let's talk about one of those men, whose story starts your book. Jason. He lived in London for 14 years and spent much of that time homeless. Tell me a bit about his story.</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, so Jason arrived at age 15, to be reunited with his mother who had been separated from him for about 13 years, since he was a child, when she moved to England. He'd had a good life in Jamaica, he was doing quite well in school and sports, but as soon as he arrived, he didn't get on with his stepdad and his mum and struggled, and ended up being kicked out by the age of 16, and being kicked out of school as well. And then kind of fending for himself on the streets. From that age, I mean, really difficult story, a person who only had a six month visa and didn't have any ID or passport. So was sleeping on the M25 between Ilford and central London, you know, making friends and trying to find a way in this new country. And over the next 12 or 13 years, he never really got out of that situation. At one point, he got a job in Carphone Warehouse before ID requirements were required. And he managed to get by, he used go down to the West End and just hang around and the amusement centers and try and help people, you know, help tourists as a middleman to get tickets or to get drugs, and was drinking a bit and just really struggling - having a really, really rough time. He describes the cold and the difficulty of being homeless. But importantly, the difficulty of being unable to access any welfare services and the housing benefit, because he didn't have his status. So always felt like deportation was on the horizon. And he was under the threat of deportation, and ended up being deported in 2014, on the charter flight.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>You write really affectionately about him, and you describe how caring he is. In particular, I really like small details you mentioned, like that he was always worried about whether you were drinking enough water and how he bought you Nivea products because he saw in the room that you were hiring, that that's what you used. But in your last meeting with him where you catch up at the end of the book, you know, he's in a really bad way. And I think it's him who says something along the lines of "if I die, don't come to my funeral" and reading that is really saddening, you write almost as though you think that Jason might not actually survive the publication of your book. At one point, you include a few testimonies, almost sort of character references, if you like, from people who know him here in the UK. Why did you want to do that? What's the ethical writerly impulse behind that and what were you trying to do for Jason there?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>I was really worried about Jason at that point, towards the end of the book. He was in a homeless shelter for the first bit of time that we knew each other, and then was kicked out of there and was just living on the streets. And actually he knew another deported person who was killed in the area. So yeah, of course, I was really worried. And I suppose I don't think the testimoies is at the end were meant in that morbid tone, they were sort of meant, because Jason had had such a difficult life, and it was almost so unlikely that he'd ended up in a book that that some people will read. And he was really excited about the book and about the project, and always asking about how it was going and always saying, you know, "I've got more, I've got more I need tell you", and really engaged and really grateful for the kind of attention I suppose.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>You say he wanted to write himself back into people's lives as well. I guess he also wanted the story of his life written and known, wants to leave a trace in some way, the right kind of trace.</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Exactly. And as I say, in the book, you know, he wanted to take me back to his old schools, but no one really recognized him there. And he wrote messages on Facebook on my laptop to people who hadn't replied and it was that kind of really sad story that made me sick. You know, I want to tell the story in all its tragedy, but also to say, you know, he's still laughing and smiling and he still made that connection with me you know, he shouldn't feel like he's totally incapable, and I just kind of came along and that was lucky. He grabbed grabbed onto me with both hands and was interesting, and exciting and exhausting to hang around with, and the people who I end with are people he knew before the street. So his gran or his auntie and they just say things that point to exactly that right, the damage but also the vitality of a person who is incredibly good at surviving.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Also in talking about that. I mean, it's clear how much relationships and connections matter in all of this, across borders. And you talk about interactions with the people who know and love the deported men who you got to know - so families, football teams, friends, and these people taught you, you say, that deportation is not suffered by individuals alone, even as it individualizes. I really, I really liked that point. Can you just explain that a little bit?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>I suppose like criminal law, immigration law, kind of individualizes, it atomizes a person and says, have you violated the law and in what ways and therefore, what should we do with you? And of course, there's provisions to consider family life - and I critique them. But the point is that the individual stands up in court as an individual, responsible for themselves. And that's kind of central to the way liberal thought and the liberal state works, right. But people don't live their lives like that; they're deeply connected and constituted by their relationships with others. And so I suppose, by focusing on friends and families who live in the UK, not only do you say you might disappear an individual, but here's the wake. Here's all the people who are still remembering and connecting with me and connecting with one another, and WhatsApping, who live here. And you might wrench an individual from that context, but you can't - their absence is still quite loud. And I suppose that, then, is a way of thinking about how deportation, even as it individualizes doesn't only affect the people deported. Of course, how could it? It affects the many people who have been also subject to enforced separation, and many of them are British children, for example. There are many ways we should argue against the power of deportation, but one of them is to get over this idea that it's just about bad individuals and think about the very many others who were invested in perhaps, you know, dad, or friend, or football mate, be able to stay and not being disappeared.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And that also seems to be an ethical impulse in your work, to show what happens after deportations, so that deportation isn't just a some kind of negative space and kind of Nowhere Land. It reminds me of the work of Reuben Anderson, who I think is somewhere in your bibliography. He has written about no go zones, and the idea of blank spaces, on maps, which of course, are never really blank at all. It seems you really want to stress that it's a tricky one, you kind of want to stress that life goes on. But at the same time, I guess maybe you're wary of doing that, because you don't want people to read your book and think, hey, actually, you know what, deportation's not so bad? You know, some of these guys picked themselves up and started businesses. And look, this is fine, why not continue with this practice? Lots of questions within that. But what what would you say for that?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>It's a good one. I mean, it's difficult. It was really difficult to write because the kind of instrumental or activist line would be: it's terrible, people might die, which is true, and people belong here. So therefore, the law has been breached, the wrong thing has been done and people should be returned. And I still feel that way. But it's a book, it's not a comment piece. And if people stick with it, and they've read all of the stories, then they should also have a sophisticated enough take to be able to hold both of those things. And, of course, it is sort of hopeful that people find ways to rebuild and to survive. And in many ways, that's the story of people who've been oppressed in various ways anyway, and that we always need to keep telling. People are not just the product of all of the violence that is done to them. They also resist and build and have fun and exercise some agency. And I suppose I wanted to keep that in there and to say, you know, some of the guys are doing okay, some of them would say, "I'd love to be able to visit the UK. But I'd rather live here". Some of them would say that. How else does one deal with what has been done to them? Should we want people to just stay in kind of limbo and displaced forever? Of course, people don't stay like that forever. Some people do. And really, some people don't survive. Far too many people don't make it. But probably more common is an incredibly brutal few years, and then some kind of a life, in a place. That's very difficult. But I wanted to hold on to that and to say that time keeps moving. And you know, Jason's life has changed since then, as have the rest. And that's important to say, rather than to just - there's something objectifying about reducing someone to the moment of their of their lowest point, that I didn't want.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Or reducing someone to kind of a mere policy outcome, I suppose without acknowledging the other dimensions of their life - it seems to me that that's what you're attempting to do, is to uphold the individual and the wholeness of the individual. And their resilience, which is an extremely tricky and dangerous word. But nonetheless, I think it's there. At the same time as critiquing the the policy, and to hold those two things, two things in tension. So one of the things we've been talking about today, I suppose it's about listening to people and failing to listen to them, or say failing to acknowledge them. So I thought this could be the moment where we turned to the <em>New Humanist</em> archive, to take a look at a piece that I think has some resonance with what we've been talking about today. So we've dug quite deep for this one, it's from 1972. And it's described as a research report entitled Teaching Racial Tolerance, that talks about various attempts to influence attitudes of young people towards what it calls "improved racial understanding", and reflects on their successes and failure. So Luke, as someone quite alert to language, what's your reaction to that term tolerance? It grates, I think, but it's still used really quite a lot today, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, definitely. I mean, it definitely grates. Tolerance - there's then the position of who is tolerating who, and I think a bit like integration, it feels a bit like, the underlying question is what we should do with them? And it doesn't unsettle.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Yeah. Who's at the centre? And who's waiting to be let in?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>Yeah. who's who's outside and provisionally welcomed and who's settled as the national insiders. And I don't think those questions are, I think those questions are more complicated than they're made out to be. So I'm very cautious about the idea of tolerance. But I suppose I do think that having a conversation about how among young people, for example, we develop different kinds of common sense, which I think already exists, I think there are really generational dynamics and regional dynamics and very localized dynamics about how people understand racial difference. And I write a bit about that, in the book, about also white Britons who came to know some of the people in this book, and how they figure. And that's important to say, actually, it's important to say that this story, and that wider network of people, is people who you might consider "tolerant". That would be to do them a disservice. But people for whom they share their lives with those who might be legalized, criminalized, and ultimately deported foreign criminals. And that might include white middle class people, in some instances, and definitely white working class people. So it's important to say that there are seeds of other ways that this country could be, and they're often held at local levels. And I think the real challenge for anti racists and for people who consider themselves progressive is to nurture that and to build constituencies of people who won't stand for it.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>The piece says that the endeavor to change adult attitudes about anything is usually an uphill struggle. In the area of race relations, the task is normally seen as formidable. That was from the 1970s. But would you agree with that quote, today? I mean, I'm thinking, you know, you shared your PhD and your book, with the people who featured in those. And your acknowledgments is obviously full of people who I guess, think along the same lines as you do. But beyond that, what audience can you reach with a book like this? And how can you make it a positive part of that uphill formidable struggle?</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>I think it's slightly limited as with any book. I mean, I wear my politics on my sleeve, to some extent, so it's probably not going to reach all audiences. But I think there are shorter ways to do that. I have the podcast, Deportation Discs, which hopefully is a way that can be shared more easily with various people. And I will say that some of the family members of the people and friends listen to that podcast,</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>It's a play on Desert Island Discs with deported people. Well, on that. Thank you very much for joining this podcast, Luke De Noronha, thank you very much.</p> <p><strong>LDN: </strong></p> <p>That's exactly it. So that I mean, that's a way of getting, you know, because a book is an 80,000 word thing. And there's some theoretical interventions in there. So I think we have to be realistic about that. But it's been shared widely among the legal sector. And I've been speaking to various solicitors and barristers, chambers and stuff. And that's interesting, because of course, barristers tend to be liberal, where I might be a slightly more insurgent in various ways. And so that's a really fruitful conversation. I'm up for that. I think we have to be honest about the limitations of, sit me down with an EDL or Britain First and somehow convert them via the story of deported black Britons. It's not the best strategy, but I think there are ways to try and get the book out there. I'd recommend anyone who's doing this kinds of work to do shorter things to try and get them out there, and to do podcasts and to get out into the world. Thanks so much.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>The sociologists Luke De Noronha, joining us from London. And if you subscribe to <em>New Humanist</em> magazine, which Luke has actually written for a couple of times before, you can access articles like that one we were discussing from decades back in the archive as part of your subscription, it's well worth your &pound;13.50 if you use that discount code of WITHREASON, at Newhumanist.org.uk/subscribe. And with me now is Samira Shackle, editor of <em>New Humanist </em>magazine, who's been having a listen along to that interview. Samira, I found that really fascinating in particular, the way that Luke talked a lot about this idea of looking beyond the individual, and about the importance of situating life stories in social structures. And that's something that can be really hard to balance. And he also talked about how once we do that, we really see the importance of complicating these labels, of criminal or illegal, they get put on to individuals. These are labels that lead really to ideas of good or bad immigrants, aren't they?</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah, I was really struck by that idea of good and bad immigrants and the idea that some people are worthy of our sympathy and empathy because they're blameless and being caught up unfairly in something, and others who are less so and aren't worthy of those same sympathy as being extended to them, or even of the same rights really, as the sort of extension of that. So I thought it was really valuable, that that's what he's chosen to focus on.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>Going back, I mean, you mentioned sympathy and I think reading the book, I realized that it's frustrating and must be frustrating for people like Luke who I think are clearly writing from a sort of activist position as well as an academic one, that in order to stir action and engagement, you might feel the need to move people. I certainly felt very moved in reading that book. And reading these, these really powerful details, like I mentioned about Jason being concerned that Luke wasn't drinking enough water and that kind of thing. I was really stirred by these things. But then I was also maybe frustrated at myself that feeling moved seems to be a prerequisite for wanting to act. And I wonder what you think about that maybe also from the perspective of being a writer?</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>I think that's a really interesting point - separately to my <em>New Humanist</em> editing job, I'm also a freelance journalist and reporter. And I guess that the work I do is journalism that's very much focused around human stories. And so I think there's a value in that approach, because it's quite human really to be stirred by details that you can find relatable. And often, with those kind of language issues that I think Luke talked about so articulately, a sort of knock on effect is that people are really dehumanized. And it becomes very, it becomes very easy to dismiss the struggles that people have. And it's a very human instinct to relate differently when you realize that there's a whole life and a whole human behind those words. I think there's a real value in that.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>And I guess I NGOs do it too. They also use the human interest story to attract sympathy and engagement in audiences, I guess it's entirely necessary.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>Yeah. And I think you - there's a difference, I think between a sort of depoliticized pulling at heartstrings and decontextualizing of story from its social structures and playing only to sympathy. I think there's a difference between doing that and using the the power of narrative and the power of the personal to engage people and draw people in, I suppose.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>I also think that Luke does tread the line really well, between presenting individual stories and showing how individual lives are negatively shaped by policy, by racism, by immigration controls, but also highlighting those individual lives and multi-dimensional, that lives go on that there is hope within those individual stories. I think he talks about, you know, the damage, and the vitality. And as he and I discussed, there's a risk in showing the vitality, that some readers might misinterpret those stories, and kind of say, "Well, hey, look, deportation can't be that bad. These guys are kind of okay, life goes on". I guess that's the risk for anyone researching this subject and wanting to draw attention to the kind of positive aspects of these otherwise quite difficult life stories.</p> <p><strong>SS: </strong></p> <p>I feel like it comes back to the idea of people not being essentialised and people being more than a single experience. People can go through terrible injustice or atrocity even and still find ways to continue a normal life and amongst the cracks of that, where they can I think that's such a universal trait. And we probably do people a disservice - in the same way perhaps, that classifying someone solely as inverted commas, "foreign criminal", you know, really reduces that person from the full extent of what they are. Sounds like a big part of what Luke's trying to do here. And I think what lots of people doing similar work want to do is to complicate the simplified narratives.</p> <p><strong>AB: </strong></p> <p>I guess, actually, that is what quite a few guests that we've had on With Reason are doing - so we had Rosie Hancock the other week, complicating the idea of the person of faith and activist or political orientations. We had Jason Arday or complicating reductive narratives about the Britpop era and race and things back in back in Series One. Hopefully, that's something we'll continue to do. That's all for today. We'll be back next week with science writer Jo Marchant. She's the author of <em>Cure</em> and more recently, <em>The Human Cosmos</em>. She'll be talking to Niki about science, the stars and our health.

            <div class="panel-body"><p class="p1"><img title="The Citizens Theatre and adjacent Palace Theatre in Glasgow in 1977" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/John-Crallan_1977.jpg" alt="John-Crallan_1977" /></p> <p class="p1">Anti-elitism is a familiar truism to anyone tuned in to public debate over the past five years or so. Phrases like &ldquo;liberal elite&rdquo; are bandied about in the press without us really knowing what they mean. The British public are constantly being told that universities are awash with cash, while the arts and the media are synonymous with elite privilege &ndash; despite evidence that they are struggling, particularly in the wake of Covid-19. And because they are considered a luxury, these institutions feel the need to show that they are useful in order to receive any funding at all.</p> <p class="p3">The real economic elites have pulled off a grand deceit. They are diverting public anger away from the obscene profiteering of billionaires, banks and global corporations and turning it onto cultural and educational high standards. Vast disparities of wealth and power thus escape scrutiny, while everything that gives life value and meaning becomes worthy and dumbed down. How were we so easily hoodwinked? And what can we do about it?</p> <p class="p3">A phrase that we hear a lot today is the need to &ldquo;democratise the arts&rdquo;. Even while budgets are squeezed more than ever, arts organisations and humanities departments within universities are under increased pressure to &ldquo;justify&rdquo; the use of taxpayers&rsquo; and students&rsquo; money by performing acts of social and cultural reparation and proving their commitment to inclusion and diversity. &ldquo;Outreach&rdquo; and &ldquo;impact&rdquo; have the ring of a social good, but they are actually the flipside of monetary measurement: as the phrase &ldquo;public accountability&rdquo; indicates, this is also about bean-counting. The requirement to &ldquo;account for yourself&rdquo; indicates a lack of legitimacy, as if you have to justify your existence.</p> <p class="p3">Forcing arts and culture organisations to be socially useful and &ldquo;engage new audiences&rdquo; is an unquestioned good to many right-thinking people, but I believe it undermines their core purpose and imposes burdens on them that they are hard pressed to fulfil. The point of these bodies should be to make great art and great culture, and to create and disseminate the highest forms of knowledge. It should not be to solve social problems that are the rightful preserve of governments and the state. By making culture, education and journalism into public relations arenas for tackling inequality, politics has given up on trying to improve society in any kind of organised way.</p> <p class="p3">This approach fits right into a world where screen-based, social media-fuelled appearance matters more than substance. The actual structure of society remains largely unchanged. Productivity is plummeting and our manufacturing industry is rusting away, but instead of addressing the problem of what we are doing as a country economically, and bridging the north&ndash;south divide meaningfully, arts centres, museums and arms of the BBC are simply plonked down in deprived areas: let them eat culture!</p> <p class="p3">We create a society that is materially unequal, but those who get clobbered about diversity and representation are at the very end of the food chain. It&rsquo;s a little hard to get equal numbers of women and men onto <em>Start the Week</em>, say, when fewer women are writing books and giving high-profile public lectures, because they lack the economic wherewithal and the social circumstances to get on and achieve those goals. These are deep structural factors that arts and media organisations have little capacity to alter.</p> <h2 class="p3">***</h2> <p class="p5">A glance at the funding guidance published by Arts Council England (ACE) illustrates the tendency I&rsquo;m talking about. Anyone seeking support for their exhibition, ballet or book has to demonstrate, exhaustively, &ldquo;whether access and diversity have been considered effectively&rdquo;, whether their project exhibits &ldquo;inclusivity and relevance&rdquo;, and if it constitutes &ldquo;public engagement&rdquo; and delivers &ldquo;civic and social benefits&rdquo;. ACE&rsquo;s vision is not restricted to supporting the arts: &ldquo;We want to see communities that are more socially cohesive and economically robust&rdquo;, it says, &ldquo;in which residents experience improved physical and mental wellbeing as a result of investment in culture.&rdquo; In a section on its website entitled &ldquo;Why art and culture matters&rdquo;, ACE lists the key &ldquo;facts&rdquo;: &ldquo;Art and culture contributes &pound;10.6 billion to the UK economy&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Arts and culture help tackle social injustice&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not really ACE&rsquo;s fault: the injunction to prove social value is imposed top-down by ministers; but it&rsquo;s a dispiritingly instrumental rationale nonetheless.</p> <p class="p3">The equivalent funding body north of the border, Creative Scotland, does state that creativity &ldquo;challenges us, entertains us and makes us think&rdquo;, but also that it makes society better: it &ldquo;makes an invaluable contribution to our health and wellbeing &ndash; both physically and mentally&rdquo;, &ldquo;opens our minds to cultural diversity and social inclusion&rdquo; and improves &ldquo;social mobility&rdquo;. The Heritage Lottery Fund, meanwhile, places great emphasis on &ldquo;outcomes&rdquo;, defined as &ldquo;a result of what your project does. It&rsquo;s a change that happens, rather than an activity or service you provide.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">Outcomes are different from outputs: &ldquo;the output of cooking dinner is a plate of food. But the outcome is a full and satisfied person,&rdquo; the document clarifies. Project outcomes are really important to us because we want to back projects that make a difference, rather than projects that just make some stuff, they say. &ldquo;Just make some stuff&rdquo;: the impatience with art for art&rsquo;s sake is palpable. A &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; outcome for grants is widening participation: &ldquo;if your project is a success, then the range of people benefiting from heritage will be more diverse than before your project started&rdquo;, in terms of &ldquo;a broader range of ages, ethnicities and social backgrounds, more disabled people, or groups who have never engaged with your heritage before&rdquo;. Other outcomes to be demonstrated include &ldquo;greater wellbeing&rdquo;: &ldquo;Participants will report, for example, increased happiness, greater satisfaction, reduced levels of anxiety, and/or that life feels more worthwhile as a result of their involvement in your project.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">I realise I&rsquo;m being a bit hard on these promoters and upholders of the arts. They are themselves responding to government stipulations. I&rsquo;m also not criticising public art as such. But why can&rsquo;t a piece of art be valuable in itself, like a delicious plate of food? Yes, we should take steps to widen access to those artworks &ndash; but as a society the best way to do that is to address the material problems of overwork and low pay that deny people the time necessary to produce and appreciate culture. The pressure we put on artists themselves is a symptom of that collective failure to take action further back up the chain.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">How do we get out of this mess? A first step would be to recognise that high arts are for everyone, not only for the economically privileged. When a public consultation was launched into the future of the BBC licence fee, one tweet summed up the prevalent view. &ldquo;Oh yes. Ordinary working-class folks really do love those orchestras [sceptical face emoji] The BBC need to do more to appeal to the working class folk, and then they can also do the high brow stuff,&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;Keep going the way they are and disaster looms.&rdquo; This kind of attitude falsely assumes that those on low incomes are unable to appreciate excellence, ignoring this country&rsquo;s rich history of working-class intellectualism and cultural activity. Myriad examples of genuine blue-collar engagement with arts and ideas are buried in the past. The late 19th century saw the emergence of individual and collective proletarian efforts to achieve the best education and experience the highest culture: to read the greats, go to the theatre, listen to classical music. Workers set up mutual improvement societies and mechanics&rsquo; institutes. Ruskin Hall, later Ruskin College, was established in 1899 to provide educational opportunities to those denied access to university. It was deliberately placed in Oxford, the home of elite scholarship.</p> <p class="p3">The cultural institutes set up by miners in south Wales were particularly impressive, with reading rooms equipped with a range of daily newspapers, well-stocked libraries, concert halls, ballrooms and rehearsal rooms. Miners read widely &ndash; <em>Das Kapital</em> but also <em>Jane Eyre</em>. By the Second World War, the Tredegar Workmen&rsquo;s Institute had a library that circulated 100,000 volumes per year, a cinema that could seat 800, regular concerts and a film society. In T<em>he Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes</em>, the historian Jonathan Rose uncovers through unpublished diaries and memoirs a lost world of autodidacticism and informal education. A Nottingham hosiery worker, recalling his childhood at the start of the 20th century, wrote: &ldquo;We loved nothing so much when I was a kid as going to my auntie&rsquo;s and listening to her records &ndash; the <em>Messiah</em>, the &lsquo;Triumphal March&rsquo; from <em>Aida</em>, <em>Il Trovatore</em>. And a lot of people read Shaw, the pamphlets and the plays, Robert Blatchford, H. G. Wells, Dickens, Thackeray.&rdquo;</p> <p class="p3">One of the foremost proponents of high culture for all was William Morris. For Morris, beauty was not anathema to manual labour: good work was bound up with the elevation of the mind. Morris fought the narrow utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham &ndash; for Morris, utility and beauty must be intertwined. He became one of a series of thinkers and campaigners who worked to bring culture and education to the masses. There were Beatrice and Sidney Webb, socialist philanthropists who helped found the Fabian Society, and the poet, free-thinker and sexual rebel Edward Carpenter, who moved to Leeds as part of the University Extension Movement, pioneered by academics who wanted to bring higher education to working-class communities in deprived areas of the country. I&rsquo;m not denying that these figures could sometimes come across as high-handed or hypocritical, but at least they expressed ideals and opened up debates that are now completely unthinkable.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">This 19th-century tradition of universal art and education would extend into the 20th century with the great idealist upsurge of brutalist municipal and council house architecture, and avant-garde theatre. Glasgow&rsquo;s Citizens Theatre combined ambitious repertoire with cheap tickets, free previews and free programmes for every member of the audience. Public bodies such as the British Academy and the Open University expressed the widespread ethos that the arts and humanities were a public good in and of themselves.</p> <p class="p3">Public service broadcasting beamed the work of television auteurs into ordinary living rooms around the country, including Dennis Potter&rsquo;s <em>Pennies from Heaven</em> and <em>The Singing Detective</em>. BBC1&rsquo;s <em>Wednesday Play</em> and its successor, <em>Play for Today</em>, broadcast between 1964 and 1984, featured innovative, on-location dramas by Mike Leigh, Alan Clarke, Stephen Frears, Ken Loach and Stephen Poliakoff: sometimes, it should be said, in the teeth of objections from BBC executives. <em>Cathy Come Home</em>, Loach&rsquo;s realist drama about homelessness, attracted 12 million viewers, a quarter of the British population at the time. ITV launched <em>The South Bank Show</em> in 1978; Channel 4 screened arthouse films late into the night. It was the era of what the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher called &ldquo;popular modernism&rdquo;, enabled by the post-1945 settlement with its generous social security and university grants for working-class art school students. As Fisher wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p class="p6">In a seeming irony, the media class&rsquo;s refusal to be paternalistic has not produced a bottom-up culture of breath-taking diversity, but one that is increasingly infantilised. By contrast, it is paternalistic cultures that treat audiences as adults, assuming that they can cope with cultural products that are complex and intellectually demanding.</p> </blockquote> <p class="p3">The rot set in from the 1980s onwards, as Margaret Thatcher dismantled the welfare state and the public began to automatically associate popular demand with the commercial imperative. This shift was not the result, as is commonly stated, of the expansion of higher education. As Raymond Williams argued in his 1958 essay &ldquo;Culture Is Ordinary,&rdquo; mass education did not lead to bad mass culture. Nor is it the case that the highest criticism always concerned itself with the highest culture. Figures like Clive James, and publications like the <em>Modern Review,</em> were intelligent takes on popular culture &ndash; TV soaps, mainstream pop, even adverts.</p> <h2 class="p4">***</h2> <p class="p5">Culture is more than entertainment: it makes us reflect, it stretches us; it lifts us away from the everyday. The best art and ideas should be available to everyone, not just the wealthy. When asked about the charge that his poems are &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;, the poet Geoffrey Hill responded, &ldquo;Human beings are difficult. We&rsquo;re difficult to ourselves, we&rsquo;re difficult to each other.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;Why is it believed that poetry, prose, painting, music should be less than we are?&rdquo; It is genuinely difficult art, he concluded, that is truly democratic.</p> <p class="p3">We must also protect culture as a political act. Culture that exists in its own right is an inherent riposte to the utilitarian overwork ethos that has taken over our lives. And art is also politically challenging. Rather than simply being a source of pleasure and diversion, novels symbolised radicalism and revolution to Victorian factory workers, &ldquo;not just because they preached the right kind of left politics&rdquo;, Jonathan Rose writes, &ldquo;but because they allowed working people to control their own minds.&rdquo; The same is true today. Culture should not be the continuation of politics through other means, but culture is political.</p> <p class="p3">At a time when newspapers are folding, galleries are struggling and theatres are closing their doors, our precious cultural institutions must once again have confidence in their true value and purpose. Only then can they enjoy public legitimacy and the financial support they so urgently need &ndash; and deserve.</p> <p class="p2"><em>Eliane Glaser&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Elitism: A Progressive Defence&rdquo; is published by Biteback.</em></p> <p class="p2"><em>This article is from the New Humanist spring 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

We were forced to cope with cleaning up our mess at exactly the same time as we were making more of it than ever. To be embarrassed about having a cleaner is to recognise how much those who can afford one can come to depend on them, while also acknowledging that this unregulated profession is often a haven for exploitation and, even under the best conditions, a gruelling way to earn a living. More than that, as Nick Duerden argues in Dishing the Dirt, cleaners are &ldquo;cultural anthropologists&rdquo;; they &ldquo;hold the key to our real identities, to the people we really are, behind closed doors.&rdquo;</p> <p>The private lives that cleaners have access to are often far from pretty. The interviewees in Duerden&rsquo;s book have some awful stories to tell: of being trafficked, of sudden dismissals and quibbling over money, of expectations that engrained filth can be turned into sparkling perfection in a couple of hours, of sheer exhaustion. Then there are the more subtle wounds caused by being treated as invisible: one cleaner Duerden interviews recalls the shamelessness with which her employer conducted an affair in front of her while his wife was away.</p> <p>Dishing the Dirt is a straightforward book, and all the better for it. The author helps a range of cleaners tell their stories, unencumbered by much wider analysis. This fine-grained detail helps to explode any simple picture of exploitation into a more nuanced portrayal of the journeys that lead people to (and sometimes from) cleaning for a living. These journeys are often literal ones: Rosi, from Spain, came to London hoping to find opportunities as an interior designer that she lacked back home, but it didn&rsquo;t quite work out that way; Amirah from Indonesia is in immigration limbo after fleeing from being trafficked into enslavement.</p> <p>For most of the cleaners Duerden talks to, there are always dreams and hopes for something better &ndash; sometimes within the same field. Yuliya from Bulgaria started off cleaning and now employs others in her own cleaning company; Maxine from Luton has a specialist crime-scene cleaning operation. There are branches of the profession that are well paid, in domestic service for &ldquo;high net-worth individuals&rdquo;. And for a few, cleaning is satisfying on its own terms. Mario, who lives in a spotless flat himself, says his OCD tendencies make him the perfect cleaner; naked cleaner (yes, they exist) Brandy not only earns higher wages by disrobing, it gives her confidence and pride.</p> <p>I don&rsquo;t think that the fact that the picture Duerden paints isn&rsquo;t one of unalloyed gloom erases the often brutal conditions, the exhaustion, the frequent exploitation and low pay. But this book reminds us that humans strive to find dignity and meaning even within lives that might seem hopeless.</p> <p>If that search for dignity and meaning is to be supported, then we need to start treating cleaning as what it is &ndash; a profession, to be regulated, recognised and respected. The casual and insecure nature of cleaning means that developing the solidarity required to improve its standing is extremely difficult. One of Duerden&rsquo;s interviewees, Marissa from the Philippines, is a founder of a nascent union that empowers cleaners, and that is certainly something to support. But really, part of the work lies on the shoulders of embarrassed middle-class people like me &ndash; if we choose to employ a cleaner, we need to treat them as we would the other professionals who make our lives easier.</p> <p><em>This article is from the New Humanist spring 2021 edition. <a href="/supportus">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

<p>I am delighted to launch a new series of videos that use magic to celebrate science. Fab sleight of hand artist Will Houstoun and I produced them, supported by The Royal Society of Chemistry and chemist Dr Suzanne Fergus (University of Hertfordshire). The three videos use sleight of hand techniques to celebrate a different scientist, and do not involve any CGI or camera trickery. </p>



<p>We are excited about this new story telling technique and recently conducted an experiment that showed that it significantly boosted people&#8217;s engagement (details <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://peerj.com/articles/9610/" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>

              <h2><a href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2020/10/14/how-parapsychology-changed-psychology/">How parapsychology changed psychology</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body">
<p>I recently co-authored a paper on how a little-known parapsychology journal was years ahead of its time.</p>



<p>Our story starts in 2011, when psychologist Daryl Bem reported several experiments that appeared to support the existence of psychic ability. Soon after, Stuart Ritchie, Chris French and I tried to replicate the studies but obtained null results. Several other academics also criticised Bem&#8217;s statistics and procedures. This type of &#8216;I have evidence for psychic ability &#8211; Oh no you don&#8217;t&#8217; back and forth has occurred many times over the years. However, this time, something odd happened.</p>



<p>Several researchers noted that the criticisms aimed at Bem’s work also applied to many studies from mainstream psychology. Many of the problems surrounded researchers changing their statistics and hypotheses after they had looked at their data, and so commentators urged researchers to submit a detailed description of their plans <strong>prior</strong> to running their studies. In 2013, psychologist Chris Chambers played a key role in getting the academic journal <em>Cortex</em>&nbsp;to adopt the procedure (known as a Registered Report), and many other journals quickly followed suit.</p>



<p>However, many academics are unaware that a little-known parapsychology journal &#8211; The European Journal of Parapsychology &#8211; implemented an early version of this concept in the 1970s. For 17&nbsp;years,&nbsp;around half of the studies in the paper were registered in advance. If the critics were right, these papers should be less likely to contain problems with their statistics and methods, and so be more likely to report spurious positive results. To find out if this was the case, I recently teamed up with Caroline Watt and Diana Kornbrot to examine the studies. The results were as expected &#8211; around 8% of the analyses from the studies that had been registered in advance were positive, compared to around 28% from the other papers. Other academics are now conducting the same sort of analyses in psychology and medicine, and finding the same pattern.</p>



<p>Academics often criticise parapsychology, but this episode is a good example of how the field is sometimes ahead of the game and can help to improve mainstream psychology. <br><br>The full paper describing this work is <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/6232/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>And Diana is now looking more broadly at openness in science. If you are a researcher with an interest in the area, you can take part in her survey <a href="https://herts.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EfYxgOn9SNkadD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>In this episode of the podcast, Sam discusses the recent social protests and civil unrest, in light of what we know about racism and police violence in America.</p>
<p>This is a transcript of a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/207-can-pull-back-brink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded podcast</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Welcome to the Making Sense podcast… This is Sam Harris.</p>
<p>OK…. Well, I’ve been trying to gather my thoughts for this podcast for more than a week—and have been unsure about whether to record it at all, frankly.</p>
<p>Conversation is the only tool we have for making progress, I firmly believe that. But many of the things we most need to talk about, seem impossible to talk about.</p>
<p>I think social media is a huge part of the problem. I’ve been saying for a few years now that, with social media, we’ve all been enrolled in a psychological experiment for which no one gave consent, and it’s not at all clear how it will turn out. And it’s still not clear how it will turn out, but it’s not looking good. It’s fairly disorienting out there. All information is becoming weaponized. All communication is becoming performative. And on the most important topics, it now seems to be fury and sanctimony and bad faith almost all the time.</p>
<p>We appear to be driving ourselves crazy. Actually, crazy. As in, incapable of coming into contact with reality, unable to distinguish fact from fiction—and then becoming totally destabilized by our own powers of imagination, and confirmation bias, and then lashing out at one other on that basis.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to talk about the current moment and the current social unrest, and its possible political implications, and other cultural developments, and suggest what it might take to pull back from the brink here. I’m going to circle in on the topics of police violence and the problem of racism, because that really is at the center of this. There is so much to talk about here, and it’s so difficult to talk about. And there is so much we don’t know. And yet, most people are behaving as though every important question was answered a long time ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching our country seem to tear itself apart for weeks now, and perhaps lay the ground for much worse to come. And I’ve been resisting the temptation to say anything of substance—not because I don’t have anything to say, but because of my perception of the danger, frankly. And if that’s the way I feel, given the pains that I’ve taken to insulate myself from those concerns, I know that almost everyone with a public platform is terrified. Journalists, and editors, and executives, and celebrities are terrified that they might take one wrong step here, and never recover.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdsmxzaHtSQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>And this is really unhealthy—not just for individuals, but for society. Because, again, all we have between us and the total breakdown of civilization is a series of successful conversations. If we can’t reason with one another, there is no path forward, other than violence. Conversation or violence.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to talk about some of the things that concern me about the current state of our communication. Unfortunately, many things are compounding our problems at the moment. We have a global pandemic which is still very much with us. And it remains to be seen how much our half-hearted lockdown, and our ineptitude in testing, and our uncoordinated reopening, and now our plunge into social protest and civil unrest will cause the Covid-19 caseload to spike. We will definitely see. As many have pointed out, the virus doesn’t care about economics or politics. It only cares that we keep breathing down each other’s necks. And we’ve certainly been doing enough of that.</p>
<p>Of course, almost no one can think about Covid-19 right now. But I’d just like to point out that many of the costs of this pandemic and the knock-on effects in the economy, and now this protest movement, many of these costs are hidden from us. In addition to killing more than 100,000 people in the US, the pandemic has been a massive opportunity cost. The ongoing implosion of the economy is imposing tangible costs, yes, but it is also a massive opportunity cost. And now this civil unrest is compounding those problems—whatever the merits of these protests may be or will be, the opportunity costs of this moment are staggering. In addition to all the tangible effects of what’s happening—the injury and death, the lost businesses, the burned buildings, the neighborhoods that won’t recover for years in many cities, the educations put on hold, and the breakdown in public trust of almost every institution—just think about all the good and important things we cannot do—cannot even <em>think</em> of doing now—and perhaps won’t contemplate doing for many years to come, because we’ll be struggling to get back to that distant paradise we once called “normal life.”</p>
<p>Of course, normal life for many millions of Americans was nothing like a paradise. The disparities in wealth and health and opportunity that we have gotten used to in this country, and that so much of our politics and ways of doing business seem to take for granted, are just unconscionable. There is no excuse for this kind of inequality in the richest country on earth. What we’re seeing now is a response to that. But it’s a confused and confusing response. Worse, it’s a response that is systematically silencing honest conversation. And this makes it dangerous.</p>
<p>This isn’t just politics and human suffering on display. It’s philosophy. It’s ideas about truth—about what it means to say that something is “true.” What we’re witnessing in our streets and online and in the impossible conversations we’re attempting to have in our private lives is a breakdown in epistemology. How does anyone figure out what’s going on in the world? What is real? If we can’t agree about what is real, or likely to be real, we will never agree about how we should live together. And the problem is, we’re stuck with one other.</p>
<p>So, what’s happening here?</p>
<p>Well, again, it’s hard to say. What is happening when <a href="https://youtu.be/viika57hTO4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a police officer or a mayor takes a knee</a> in front of a crowd of young people who have been berating him for being a cog in the machinery of systemic racism? Is this a profound moment of human bonding that transcends politics, or is it the precursor to the breakdown of society? Or is it both? It’s not entirely clear.</p>
<p>In the most concrete terms, we are experiencing widespread social unrest in response to what is widely believed to be an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at the black community by racist cops and racist policies. And this unrest has drawn a counter-response from law enforcement—much of which, ironically, is guaranteed to exacerbate the problem of police violence, both real and perceived. And many of the videos we’ve seen of the police cracking down on peaceful protesters are hideous. Some of this footage has been unbelievable. And this is one of many vicious circles that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>Again, there is so much to be confused about here. We’ve now seen endless video of police inflicting senseless violence on truly peaceful protesters, and yet we have also seen video of the police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrVp8vlQyU">standing idly by</a> while looters completely destroy businesses. What explains this? Is there a policy that led to this bizarre inversion of priorities? Are the police angry at the protesters for vilifying them, and simultaneously trying to teach society a lesson by letting crime and mayhem spread elsewhere in the city? Or is it just less risky to collide with peaceful protesters? Or is the whole spectacle itself a lie? How representative are these videos of what’s actually going on? Is there much less chaos actually occurring than is being advertised to us?</p>
<p>Again, it’s very hard to know.</p>
<p>What’s easy to know is that civil discourse has broken down. It seems to me that we’ve long been in a situation where the craziest voices on both ends of the political spectrum have been amplifying one another and threatening to produce something truly dangerous. And now I think they have. The amount of misinformation in the air—the degree to which even serious people seem to be ruled by false assumptions and non sequiturs—is just astonishing.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep in mind that, with the presidential election coming in November, the stakes are really high. As most of you know, I consider four more years of Trump to be an existential threat to our democracy. And I believe that the last two weeks have been very good for him, politically, even when everything else seemed to go very badly for him. I know the polls don’t say this. A large majority of people disapprove of his handling this crisis so far. But I think we all know now to take polls with a grain of salt. There is the very real problem of preference falsification—especially in an environment of intense social pressure. People will often say what they think is socially acceptable, and then think, or say, or do something very different in private—like when they’re alone in a voting booth.</p>
<p>Trump has presided over the complete dismantling of American influence in the world and the destruction of our economy. I know the stock market has looked good, but the stock market has become totally uncoupled from the economy. According to the stock market, the future is just as bright now as it was in January of this year, before most of us had even heard of a novel coronavirus. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. And a lot can happen in the next few months. The last two weeks feel like a decade. And my concern is that if Trump now gets to be the law-and-order President, that may be his path to re-election, if such a path exists. Of course, this crisis has revealed, yet again, how unfit he is to be President. The man couldn’t strike a credible note of reconciliation if the fate of the country depended on it—and the fate of the country has depended on it. I also think it’s possible that these protests wouldn’t be happening, but for the fact that Trump is President. Whether or not the problem of racism has gotten worse in our society, having Trump as President surely makes it seem like it has. It has been such a repudiation of the Obama presidency that, for many people, it has made it seem that white supremacy is now ascendant. So, all the more reason to get rid of Trump in November.</p>
<p>But before this social unrest, our focus was on how incompetent Trump was in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. And now he has been given a very different battle to fight. A battle against leftwing orthodoxy, which is growing more stifling by the minute, and civil unrest. If our social order frays sufficiently, restoring it will be the only thing that most people care about in November. Just think of what an act of domestic terrorism would do politically now. Things can change very, very quickly. And to all a concern for basic law and order “racist”, isn’t going to wash.</p>
<p>Trust in institutions has totally broken down. We’ve been under a very precarious quarantine for more than 3 months, which almost the entire medical profession has insisted is necessary. Doctors and public health officials have castigated people on the political Right for protesting this lockdown. People have been unable to be with their loved ones in their last hours of life. They’ve been unable to hold funerals for them. But now we have doctors and public officials by the thousands, signing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letters</a>, making public statements, saying it’s fine to stand shoulder to shoulder with others in the largest protests our nation has ever seen. The degree to which this has undermined confidence in public health messaging is hard to exaggerate. Whatever your politics, this has been just a mortifying piece of hypocrisy. Especially so, because the pandemic has been hitting the African American community hardest of all. How many people will die because of these protests? It’s a totally rational question to ask, but the question itself is taboo now.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that almost everything appears upside down at the moment.</p>
<p>Before I get into details on police violence, first let me try to close the door to a few misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the proximate cause of all this: The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. I’ll have more to say about this in a minute, but nothing I say should detract from the following observation: That <a href="https://youtu.be/vksEJR9EPQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> was absolutely sickening, and it revealed a degree of police negligence and incompetence and callousness that everyone was right to be horrified by. In particular, the actions of Derek Chauvin, the cop who kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes, his actions were so reckless and so likely to cause harm that there&#8217;s no question he should be prosecuted. And he is being prosecuted. He’s been indicted for 2nd degree murder and manslaughter, and I suspect he will spend many, many years in prison. And, this is not to say “the system is working.” It certainly seems likely that without the cell phone video, and the public outrage, Chauvin might have gotten away with it—to say nothing of the other cops with him, who are also now being prosecuted. If this is true, we clearly need a better mechanism with which to police the police.</p>
<p>So, as I said, I&#8217;ll return to this topic, because I think most people are drawing the wrong conclusions from this video, and from videos like it, but let me just echo everyone&#8217;s outrage over what happened. This is precisely the kind of police behavior that everyone should find abhorrent.</p>
<p>On the general topic of racism in America, I want to make a few similarly clear, preemptive statements:</p>
<p>Racism is still a problem in American society. No question. And slavery—which was racism’s most evil expression—was this country’s founding sin. We should also add the near-total eradication of the Native Americans to that ledger of evil. Any morally sane person who learns the details of these historical injustices finds them shocking, whatever their race. And the legacy of these crimes—crimes that were perpetrated for centuries—remains a cause for serious moral concern today. I have no doubt about this. And nothing I’m about to say, should suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>And I don’t think it’s an accident that the two groups I just mentioned, African Americans and Native Americans, suffer the worst from inequality in America today. How could the history of racial discrimination in this country not have had lasting effects, given the nature of that history? And if anything good comes out of the current crisis, it will be that we manage to find a new commitment to reducing inequality in all its dimensions. The real debate to have is about how to do this, economically and politically. But the status quo that many of us take for granted to is a betrayal of our values, whether we realize it or not. If it’s not a betrayal or your values now, it will be a betrayal of your values when you become a better person. And if you don’t manage that, it will be a betrayal of your kid’s values when they’re old enough to understand the world they are living in. The difference between being very lucky in our society, and very unlucky, should not be as enormous as it is.</p>
<p>However, the question that interests me, given what has been true of the past and is now true of the present, is what should we do next? What should we do to build a healthier society?</p>
<p>What should we do next?  Tomorrow… next week…. Obviously, I don’t have the answers. But I am very worried that many of the things we’re doing now, and seem poised to do, will only make our problems worse. And I’m especially worried that it has become so difficult to talk about this. I’m just trying to have conversations. I’m just trying to figure these things out in real time, with other people. And there is no question that conversation itself has become dangerous.</p>
<p>Think about the politics of this. Endless imagery of people burning and looting independent businesses that were struggling to survive, and seeing the owners of these businesses beaten by mobs, cannot be good for the cause of social justice. Looting and burning businesses, and assaulting their owners, isn’t social justice, or even social protest. It’s crime. And having imagery of these crimes that highlight black involvement circulate endlessly on Fox News and on social media cannot be good for the black community. But it might yet be good for Trump.</p>
<p>And it could well kick open the door to a level of authoritarianism that many of us who have been very worried about Trump barely considered possible. It’s always seemed somewhat paranoid to me to wonder whether we’re living in Weimar Germany. I’ve had many conversations about this. I had <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/the-road-to-tyranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy Snyder on the podcast</a>, who’s been worrying about the prospect of tyranny in the US for several years now. I’ve known, in the abstract, that democracies can destroy themselves. But the idea that it could happen here still seemed totally outlandish to me. It doesn’t anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, what we’ve been seeing in the streets isn’t just one thing. Some people are protesting for reasons that I fully defend. They’re outraged by specific instances of police violence, like the killing of George Floyd, and they’re worried about creeping authoritarianism—which we really should be worried about now. And they’re convinced that our politics is broken, because it is broken, and they are deeply concerned that our response to the pandemic and the implosion of our economy will do nothing to address the widening inequality in our society. And they recognize that we have a President who is an incompetent, divisive, conman and a crackpot at a time when we actually need wise leadership.</p>
<p>All of that is hard to put on a sign, but it’s all worth protesting.</p>
<p>However, it seems to me that most protesters are seeing this moment exclusively through the lens of identity politics—and racial politics in particular. And some of them are even celebrating the breakdown of law and order, or at least remaining nonjudgmental about it. And you could see, in the early days of this protest, news anchors take that line, on CNN, for instance. Talking about the history of social protest, “Sometimes it has to be violent, right? What, do you think all of these protests need to be nonviolent?” Those words came out of Chris Cuomo&#8217;s mouth, and Don Lemon&#8217;s mouth. Many people have been circulating a half quote from Martin Luther King Jr. about riots being “the language of the unheard.” They’re <a href="https://youtu.be/pjYZZC5i_AU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving out the part</a> where he made it clear that he believed riots harmed the cause of the black community and helped the cause of racists.</p>
<p>There are now calls to defund and even to abolish the police. This may be psychologically understandable when you’ve spent half your day on Twitter watching videos of cops beating peaceful protesters. Those videos are infuriating. And I’ll have a lot more to say about police violence in a minute. But if you think a society without cops is a society you would want to live in, you have lost your mind. Giving a monopoly on violence to the state is just about the best thing we have ever done as a species. It ranks right up there with keeping our shit out of our food. Having a police force that can deter crime, and solve crimes when they occur, and deliver violent criminals to a functioning justice system, is the necessary precondition for almost anything else of value in society.</p>
<p>We need police reform, of course. There are serious questions to ask about the culture of policing—its hiring practices, training, the militarization of so many police forces, outside oversight, how police departments deal with corruption, the way the police unions keep bad cops on the job, and yes, the problem of racist cops. But the idea that any serious person thinks we can do without the police—or that less trained and less vetted cops will magically be better than more trained and more vetted ones—this just reveals that our conversation on these topics has run completely off the rails. Yes, we should give more resources to community services. We should have psychologists or social workers make first contact with the homeless or the mentally ill. Perhaps we’re giving cops jobs they shouldn’t be doing. All of that makes sense to rethink. But the idea that what we&#8217;re witnessing now is a matter of the cops being over-resourced—that we&#8217;ve given them too much training, that we&#8217;ve made the job too attractive—so that the people we’re recruiting are of too high a quality. That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s been alarming here is that we’re seeing prominent people—in government, in media, in Hollywood, in sports—speak and act as though the breakdown of civil society, and of society itself, is a form of progress and any desire for law enforcement is itself a form of racist oppression. At one point the woman who&#8217;s running the City Council in Minneapolis, which just decided to abolish the police force, was asked by a journalist, I believe on CNN, “What do I do if someone&#8217;s breaking into my house in the middle of the night? Who do I call?” And her first response to that question was, “You need to recognize what a statement of privilege that question is.” She&#8217;s since had to walk that back, because it&#8217;s one of the most galling and embarrassing things a public official has ever said, but this is how close the Democratic Party is to sounding completely insane. You cannot say that if someone is breaking into your house, and you&#8217;re terrified, and you want a police force that can respond, that fear is a symptom of “white privilege.” This is where Democratic politics goes to die.</p>
<p>Again, what is alarming about this is that this woke analysis of the breakdown of law and order will only encourage an increasingly authoritarian response, as well as the acceptance of that response by many millions of Americans.</p>
<p>If you step back, you will notice that there is a kind of ecstasy of ideological conformity in the air. And it’s destroying institutions. It&#8217;s destroying the very institutions we rely on to get our information—universities, the press. The New York Times in recent days, seems to be preparing for a self-immolation in recent days. No one wants to say or even think anything that makes anyone uncomfortable—certainly not anyone who has more wokeness points than they do. It’s just become too dangerous. There are people <a href="https://wwos.nine.com.au/news/nba-announcer-fired-over-controversial-all-lives-matter-tweet/a9a50198-4b52-4cb7-a800-e0ffacb3302d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being fired</a> for tweeting “All Lives Matter.” #AllLivesMatter, in the current environment, is being read as a naked declaration of white supremacy. That is how weird this moment is. A soccer player on the LA Galaxy <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/rowdies/2020/06/05/la-galaxy-releases-player-after-wifes-racist-and-violent-social-media-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fired</a> for something his wife tweeted…</p>
<p>Of course, there are real problems of inequality and despair at the bottom of these protests. People who have never found a secure or satisfying place in the world—or young people who fear they never will—people who have seen their economic prospects simply vanish, and people who have had painful encounters with racism and racist cops—people by the millions are now surrendering themselves to a kind of religious awakening. But like most religious awakenings, this movement is not showing itself eager to make honest contact with reality.</p>
<p>On top of that, we find extraordinarily privileged people, whatever the color of their skin—people who have been living wonderful lives in their gated communities or 5<sup>th</sup> avenue apartments—and who feel damn guilty about it—they are supporting this movement uncritically, for many reasons. Of course, they care about other people—I’m sure most of them have the same concerns about inequality that I do—but they are also supporting this movement because it promises a perfect expiation of their sins. If you have millions of dollars, and shoot botox into your face, and vacation on St. Bart’s, and you’re liberal—the easiest way to sleep at night is to be as woke as AOC and like every one of her tweets.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just with the looting, and the arson, and the violence. There are problems with these peaceful protests themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not questioning anyone’s right to protest. Even our deranged president can pay lip service to that right—which he did as the DC police were violently dispersing a peaceful protest so that he could get his picture taken in front of that church, awkwardly holding a bible, as though he had never held a book in life.</p>
<p>The problem with the protests is that they are animated, to a remarkable degree, by confusion and misinformation. And I’ll explain why I think that’s the case. And, of course, this will be controversial. Needless to say, many people will consider the color of my skin to be disqualifying here. I could have invited any number of great, black intellectuals onto the podcast to make these points for me. But that struck me as a form of cowardice. Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Coleman Hughes, Kmele Foster, these guys might not agree with everything I’m about to say, but any one of them could walk the tightrope I’m now stepping out on far more credibly than I can.</p>
<p>But, you see, that’s part of the problem. The perception that the color of a person’s skin, or even his life experience, matters for this discussion is a pernicious illusion. For the discussion we really need to have, the color of a person’s skin, and even his life experience, simply does not matter. It cannot matter. We have to break this spell that the politics of identity has cast over everything.</p>
<p>Ok…</p>
<p>As I’ve already acknowledged, there is a legacy of racism in the United States that we’re still struggling to outgrow. That is obvious. There are real racists out there. And there are ways in which racism became institutionalized long ago. Many of you will remember that during the crack epidemic the penalties for crack and powder cocaine were quite different. And this led black drug offenders to be locked up for much longer than white ones. Now, whether the motivation for that policy was consciously racist or not, I don’t know, but it was effectively racist. Nothing I’m about to say entails a denial of these sorts of facts. There just seems to be no question that boys who grow up with their fathers in prison start life with a significant strike against them. So criminal justice reform is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>And I’m not denying that many black people, perhaps most, have interactions with cops, and others in positions of power, or even random strangers, that seem unambiguously racist. Sometimes this is because they are actually in the presence of racism, and perhaps sometimes it only seems that way. I’ve had unpleasant encounters with cops, and customs officers, and TSA screeners, and bureaucrats of every kind, and even with people working in stores or restaurants. People aren’t always nice or ethical. But being white, and living in a majority white society, I’ve never had to worry about whether any of these collisions were the result of racism. And I can well imagine that in some of these situations, had I been black, I would have come away feeling that I had encountered yet another racist in the wild. So I consider myself very lucky to have gone through life not having to think about any of that. Surely that’s one form of white privilege.</p>
<p>So, nothing I’m going to say denies that we should condemn racism—whether interpersonal or institutional—and we should condemn it wherever we find it. But as a society, we simply can’t afford to find and condemn racism where it doesn’t exist. And we should be increasingly aware of the costs of doing that. The more progress we make on issues of race, the less racism there will be to find, and the more likely we’ll find ourselves chasing after its ghost.</p>
<p>The truth is, we have made considerable progress on the problem of racism in America. This isn’t 1920, and it isn’t 1960. We had a two-term black president. We have black congressmen and women. We have black mayors and black chiefs of police. There are major cities, like Detroit and Atlanta, going on their fifth or sixth consecutive black mayor. Having more and more black people in positions of real power, in what is still a majority white society, is progress on the problem of racism. And the truth is, it might not even solve the problem we’re talking about. When Freddy Gray was killed in Baltimore, virtually everyone who could have been held accountable for his death was black. The problem of police misconduct and reform is complicated, as we’re about to see. But obviously, there is more work to do on the problem of racism. And, more important, there is much more work to do to remedy the inequalities in our society that are so correlated with race, and will still be correlated with race, even after the last racist has been driven from our shores.</p>
<p>The question of how much of today’s inequality is due to existing racism—whether racist people or racist policies—is a genuinely difficult question to answer. And to answer it, we need to distinguish the past from the present.</p>
<p>Take wealth inequality, for example: The median white family has a net worth of around $170,000—these data are a couple of years old, but they’re probably pretty close to what’s true now. The median black family has a net worth of around $17,000. So we have a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2019/06/18/a-conversation-about-the-racial-wealth-gap-and-how-to-address-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tenfold difference in median wealth</a>. (That’s the median, not the mean: Half of white families are below 170,000 and half above; half of black families are below 17,000 and half above. And we’re talking about wealth here, not income.)</p>
<p>This disparity in wealth persists even for people whose incomes are in the top 10 percent of the income distribution. For whites in the top 10 percent for income, the median net worth is $1.8 million; for blacks it’s around $350,000. There are probably many things that account for this disparity in wealth. It seems that black families that make it to the top of the income distribution fall out of it more easily than white families do. But it’s also undeniable that black families have less intergenerational wealth accumulated through inheritance.</p>
<p>How much of this is inequality due to the legacy of slavery? And how much of it is due to an ensuing century of racist policies? I’m prepared to believe quite a lot. And it strikes me as totally legitimate to think about paying reparations as a possible remedy here. Of course, one will then need to talk about reparations for the Native Americans. And then one wonders where this all ends. And what about blacks who aren’t descended from slaves, but who still suffered the consequences of racism in the US? In listening to people like <a href="https://youtu.be/FXt9Q5h1sCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John McWhorter</a> and Coleman Hughes discuss this topic, I’m inclined to think that reparations is probably unworkable as a policy. But the truth is that I’m genuinely unsure about this.</p>
<p>Whatever we decide about the specific burdens of the past, we have to ask, how much of current wealth inequality is due to existing racism and to existing policies that make it harder for black families to build wealth? And the only way to get answers to those questions is to have a dispassionate discussion about facts.</p>
<p>The problem with the social activism we are now seeing—what John McWhorter has called “the new religion of anti-Racism”—is that it finds racism nearly everywhere, even where it manifestly does not exist. And this is incredibly damaging to the cause of achieving real equality in our society. It’s almost impossible to exaggerate the evil and injustice of slavery and its aftermath. But it is possible to exaggerate how much racism currently exists at an Ivy League university, or in Silicon Valley, or at the Oscars. And those exaggerations are toxic—and, perversely, they may produce more real racism. It seems to me that false claims of victimhood can diminish the social stature of any group, even a group that has a long history of real victimization.</p>
<p>The imprecision here—the bad-faith arguments, the double standards, the goal-post shifting, the <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hrFzz1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idiotic opinion pieces</a> in the New York Times, the defenestrations on social media, the general hysteria that the cult of wokeness has produced—I think this is all extremely harmful to civil society, and to effective liberal politics, and to the welfare of African Americans.</p>
<p>So, with that as preamble, let’s return to the tragic death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>As I said, I believe that any sane person who watches that video will feel that they have witnessed a totally unjustified killing. So, people of any race, are right to be horrified by what happened there. But now I want to ask a few questions, and I want us to try to consider them dispassionately. And I really want you to watch your mind while you do this. There are very likely to be few tripwires installed there, and I’m about to hit them. So just do your best to remain calm.</p>
<p>Does the killing of George Floyd prove that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>Does it even suggest that we have a problem of racism in the United States?</p>
<p>In other words, do we have reason to believe that, had Floyd been white, he wouldn’t have died in a similar way?</p>
<p>Do the dozen or so other videos that have emerged in recent years, of black men being killed by cops, do they prove, or even suggest, that there is an epidemic of lethal police violence directed especially at black men and that this violence is motivated by racism?</p>
<p>Most people seem to think that the answers to these questions are so obvious that to even pose them as I just did is obscene. The answer is YES, and it’s a yes that now needs to be shouted in the streets.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that if you take even 5 minutes to look at the data on crime and police violence, the answer appears to be “no,” in every case, albeit with one important caveat. I’m not talking about how the police behaved in 1970 or even 1990. But in the last 25 years, violent crime has come down significantly in the US, and so has the police use of deadly force. And as you’re about to see, the police used more deadly force against white people—both in absolute numbers, and in terms of their contribution to crime and violence in our society. But the public perception is, of course, completely different.</p>
<p>In a city like Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-12/lapd-use-of-force-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 was a 30-year low</a> for police shootings. Think about that…. Do the people who were protesting in Los Angeles, peacefully and violently, do the people who were ransacking and burning businesses by the hundreds—in many cases, businesses that will not return to their neighborhoods—do the people who caused so much damage to the city, that certain neighborhoods, ironically the neighborhoods that are disproportionately black, will take years, probably decades to recover, do the celebrities who supported them, and even bailed them out of jail—do any of these people know that 2019 was the 30-year low for police shootings in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Before I step out further over the abyss here, let me reiterate: Many of you are going to feel a visceral negative reaction to what I’m about to say. You’re not going to like the way it sounds. You’re especially not going to like the way it sounds coming from a white guy. This feeling of not liking, this feeling of outrage, this feeling of disgust—this feeling of “Sam, what the fuck is wrong with you, why are you even touching this topic?”—this feeling isn’t an argument. It isn’t, or shouldn’t be, the basis for your believing anything to be true or false about the world.</p>
<p>Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that I or anyone else needs to respect. Your capacity to be offended isn’t something that you should respect. In fact, it is something that you should be on your guard for. Perhaps more than any other property of your mind, this feeling can mislead you.</p>
<p>If you care about justice—and you absolutely should—you should care about facts and the ability to discuss them openly. Justice requires contact with reality. It simply isn’t the case—it cannot be the case—that the most pressing claims on our sense of justice need come from those who claim to be the most offended by conversation itself.</p>
<p>So, I’m going to speak the language of facts right now, in so far as we know them, all the while knowing that these facts run very much counter to most people’s assumptions. Many of the things you think you know about crime and violence in our society are almost certainly wrong. And that should matter to you.</p>
<p>So just take a moment and think this through with me.</p>
<p>How many people are killed each year in America by cops? If you don’t know, guess. See if you have any intuitions for these numbers. Because your intuitions are determining how you interpret horrific videos of the sort we saw coming out of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The answer for many years running is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 1000</a>. One thousand people are killed by cops in America each year. There are about 50 to 60 million encounters between civilians and cops each year, and <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 10 million arrests</a>. That’s down from a high of over 14 million arrests annually throughout the 1990’s. So, of the 10 million occasions where a person attracts the attention of the police, and the police decide to make an arrest, about 1000 of those people die as a result. (I’m sure a few people get killed even when no arrest was attempted, but that has to be a truly tiny number.) So, without knowing anything else about the situation, if the cops decide to arrest you, it would be reasonable to think that your chance of dying is around 1/10,000. Of course, in the United States, it’s higher than it is in other countries. So I’m not saying that this number is acceptable. But it is what it is for a reason, as we’re about to see.</p>
<p>Now, there are a few generic things I’d like to point here before we get further into the data. They should be uncontroversial.</p>
<p>First, it’s almost certainly the case that of these 1000 officer-caused deaths each year, some are entirely justified—it may even be true that most are entirely justified—and some are entirely unjustified, and some are much harder to judge. And that will be true next year. And the year after that.</p>
<p>Of the unjustified killings, there are vast differences between them. Many have nothing in common but for the fact that a cop killed someone unnecessarily. It might have been a terrible misunderstanding, or incompetence, or just bad luck, and in certain cases it could be a cop who decides to murder someone because he’s become enraged, or he’s just a psychopath. And it is certainly possible that racial bias accounts for some number of these unjustified killings.</p>
<p>Another point that should be uncontroversial—but may sound a little tone-deaf in the current environment, where we’ve inundated with videos of police violence in response to these protests. But this has to be acknowledged whenever we’re discussing this topic: Cops have a very hard job. In fact, in the current environment, they have an almost impossible job.</p>
<p>If you’re making 10 million arrests every year, some number of people will decide not to cooperate. There can be many reasons for this. A person could be mentally ill, or drunk, or on drugs. Of course, rather often the person is an actual criminal who doesn’t want to be arrested.</p>
<p>Among innocent people, and perhaps this getting more common these days, a person might feel that resisting arrest is the right thing to do, ethically or politically or as a matter of affirming his identity. After all, put yourself in his shoes, he did nothing wrong. Why are the cops arresting him? I don’t know if we have data on the numbers of people who resist arrest by race. But I can well imagine that if it’s common for African Americans to believe that the only reason they have been singled out for arrest is due to racism on the part of the police, that could lead to greater levels of non-compliance. Which seems very likely to lead to more unnecessary injury and death. This is certainly one reason why it is wise to have the racial composition of a police force mirror that of the community it’s policing. Unfortunately, there’s no evidence that this will reduce lethal violence from the side of the police. In fact, the evidence we have suggests that black and Hispanic cops are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more likely</a> to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. But it would surely change the perception of the community that racism is a likely explanation for police behavior, which itself might reduce conflict.</p>
<p>When a cop goes hands on a person in an attempt to control his movements or make an arrest, that person’s resistance poses a problem that most people don’t understand. If you haven’t studied this topic. If you don’t know what it physically takes to restrain and immobilize a non-compliant person who may be bigger and stronger than you are, and if you haven’t thought through the implications of having a gun on your belt while attempting to do that—a gun that can be grabbed and used against you, or against a member of the public—then your intuitions about what makes sense here, tactically and ethically, are very likely to be bad.</p>
<p>If you haven’t trained with firearms under stress. If you don’t know how suddenly situations can change. If you haven’t experienced how quickly another person can close the distance on you, and how little time you have to decide to draw your weapon. If you don’t know how hard it is to shoot a moving target, or even a stationary one, when your heart is beating out of your chest. You very likely have totally unreasonable ideas about what we can expect from cops in situations like these. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwWado4SVY&amp;bpctr=1592453276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbOLb0O7Pw&amp;bpctr=1592455027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_87GBOCVYTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]</p>
<p>And there is another fact that looms over all this like the angel of Death, literally: Most cops do not get the training they need. They don’t get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQLOmfx8X_E&amp;feature=emb_title">hand-to-hand training</a> they need—they don’t have good skills to subdue people without harming them. All you need to do is watch YouTube videos of botched arrests to see this. The martial arts community stands in perpetual astonishment at <a href="https://youtu.be/F4VeHOkt_o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kinds of things cops do and fail to do</a> once they start fighting with suspects. Cops also don’t get the firearms training they need. Of course, there are elite units in many police departments, but most cops do not have the training they need to do the job they’re being asked to do.</p>
<p>It is also true, no doubt, that some cops are racist bullies. And there are corrupt police departments that cover for these guys, and cover up police misconduct generally, whether it was borne of racism or not.</p>
<p>But the truth is that even if we got rid of all bad cops, which we absolutely should do, and there were only good people left, and we got all these good people the best possible training, and we gave them the best culture in which to think about their role in society, and we gave them the best methods for de-escalating potentially violent situations—which we absolutely must do—and we scrubbed all the dumb laws from our books, so that when cops were required to enforce the law, they were only risking their lives and the lives of civilians for reasons that we deem necessary and just—so the war on drugs is obviously over—even under these conditions of perfect progress, we are still guaranteed to have some number of cases each year where a cop kills a civilian in a way that is totally unjustified, and therefore tragic. Every year, there will be some number of families who will be able to say that the cops killed their son or daughter, or father or mother, or brother or sister. And videos of these killings will occasionally surface, and they will be horrific. This seems guaranteed to happen.</p>
<p>So, while we need to make all these improvements, we still need to understand that there are very likely always to going to be videos of cops doing something inexplicable, or inexplicably stupid, that results in an innocent person’s death, or a not-so-innocent person’s death. And sometimes the cop will be white and the victim will be black. We have 10 million arrests each year. And we now live in a panopticon where practically everything is videotaped.</p>
<p>I’m about to get further into the details of what we know about police violence, but I want to just put it to you now: If we’re going to let the health of race relations in this country, or the relationship between the community and the police, depend on whether we ever see a terrible video of police misconduct again, the project of healing these wounds in our society is doomed.</p>
<p>About a week into these protests I heard Van Jones on CNN say, “If we see one more video of a cop brutalizing a black man, this country could go over the edge.” He said this, not as indication of how dangerously inflamed people have become. He seemed to be saying it as an ultimatum to the police. With 10 million arrests a year, arrests that have to take place in the most highly armed society in the developed world, I hope you understand how unreasonable that ultimatum is.</p>
<p>We have to put these videos into context. And we have to acknowledge how different they are from one another. Some of them are easy to interpret. But some are quite obviously being interpreted incorrectly by most people—especially by activists. And there are a range of cases—some have video associated with them and some don’t—that are now part of a litany of anti-racist outrage, and the names of the dead are intoned as though they were all evidence of the same injustice. And yet, they are not.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XKQqgVlk0NQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Scott</a> was stopped for a broken taillight and got out of his car and tried to flee. There might have been a brief struggle over the officer’s taser, that part of the video isn’t clear. But what is clear is that he was shot in the back multiple times as he was running away. That was insane. There was zero reason for the officer to feel that his life was under threat at the point he opened fire. And for that unjustified shooting, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. I’m not sure that’s long enough. That seemed like straight-up murder.</p>
<p>The George Floyd video, while even more disturbing to watch, is harder to interpret. I don’t know anything about Derek Chauvin, the cop who knelt on his neck. It’s quite possible that he’s a terrible person who should have never been a cop. He seems to have a significant number of complaints against him—though, as far as I know, the details of those complaints haven’t been released. And he might be a racist on top of being a bad cop. Or he might be a guy who was totally in over his head and thought you could restrain someone indefinitely by keeping a knee on their neck indefinitely. I don’t know. I’m sure more facts will come out. But whoever he is, I find it very unlikely that he was intending to kill George Floyd. Think about it. He was surrounded by irate witnesses and being filmed. Unless he was aspiring to become the most notorious murderer in human history, it seems very unlikely that he was intending to commit murder in that moment. It’s possible, of course. But it doesn’t seem the likeliest explanation for his behavior.</p>
<p>What I believe we saw on that video was the result of a tragic level of negligence and poor training on the part of those cops. Or terrible recruitment—it’s possible that none of these guys should have ever been cops. I think for one of them, it was only his fourth day on the job. Just imagine that. Just imagine all things you don’t know as a new cop.  It could also be a function of bad luck in terms of Floyd’s underlying health. It’s been reported that he was complaining of being unable to breath before Chauvin pinned him with his knee. The knee on his neck might not have been the only thing that caused his death. It could have also been the weight of the other officer pinning him down.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly what happened in the cast of Eric Garner. Half the people on earth believe they witnessed a cop choke Eric Garner to death in that video. That does not appear to be what happened. When Eric Garner is saying “I can’t breathe” he’s not being choked. He’s being held down on the pavement by several officers. Being forced down on your stomach under the weight of several people can kill a person, especially someone with lung or heart disease. In the case of Eric Garner, it is absolutely clear that the cop who briefly attempted to choke him was no longer choking him. If you doubt that, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/Nql1xRtWKOU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> again.</p>
<p>And if you are recoiling now from my interpretation of these videos, you really should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/_c-E_i8Q5G0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the killing of Tony Timpa</a>. It’s also terribly disturbing, but it removes the variable of race and it removes any implication of intent to harm on the part of the cops about as clearly as you could ask. It really is worth watching as a corrective to our natural interpretation of these other videos.</p>
<p>Tony Timpa was a white man in Dallas, who was suffering some mental health emergency and cocaine intoxication. And he actually called 911 himself. What we see is the bodycam footage from the police, which shows that he was already in handcuffs when they arrived—a security guard had cuffed him. And then the cops take over, and they restrain Timpa on the ground, by rolling him onto a stomach and putting their weight on him, very much like in the case of Eric Garner. And they keep their weight on him—one cop has a knee on his upper back, which is definitely much less aggressive than a knee on the neck—but they crush the life out of him all the same, over the course of 13 minutes. He’s not being choked. The cops are not being rough. There’s no animus between them and Timpa. It was not a hostile arrest. They clearly believe that they’re responding to a mental health emergency. But they keep him down on his belly, under their weight, and they’re cracking jokes as he loses consciousness. Now, your knowledge that he’s going to be dead by the end of this video, make their jokes seem pretty callous. But this was about as benign an imposition of force by cops as you’re going to see. The crucial insight you will have watching this video, is that the officers not only had no intent to kill Tony Timpa, they don’t take his pleading seriously because they have no doubt that what they’re doing is perfectly safe—perfectly within protocol. They’ve probably done this hundreds of times before.</p>
<p>If you watch that video—and, again, fair warning, it is disturbing—but imagine how disturbing it would have been to our society if Tony Timpa had been black. If the only thing you changed about the video was the color of Timpa’s skin, then that video would have detonated like a nuclear bomb in our society, exactly as the George Floyd video did. In fact, in one way it is worse, or would have been perceived to be worse. I mean, just imagine white cops telling jokes as they crushed the life out of a black Tony Timpa… Given the nature of our conversation about violence, given the way we perceive videos of this kind, there is no way that people would have seen that as anything other than a lynching. And yet, it would not have been a lynching.</p>
<p>Now, I obviously have no idea what was in the minds of cops in Minneapolis. And perhaps we’ll learn at trial. Perhaps a tape of Chauvin using the N-word in another context will surface, bringing in a credible allegation of racism. It seems to me that Chauvin is going to have a very hard time making sense of his actions. But most people who saw that video believe they have seen, with their own eyes, beyond any possibility of doubt, a racist cop intentionally murder an innocent man. That’s not what the video necessarily shows.</p>
<p>As I said, these videos can be hard to interpret, even while seeming very easy to interpret. And these cases, whether we have associated video or not, are very different. Michael Brown is reported to have punched a cop in the face and attempted to get his gun. As far as I know, there’s no video of that encounter. But, if true, that is an entirely different situation. If you’re attacking a cop, trying to get his gun, that is a life and death struggle that almost by definition for the cop, and it most cases justifies the use of lethal force. And honestly, it seems that no one within a thousand miles of Black Lives Matter is willing to make these distinctions. An attitude of anti-racist moral outrage is not the best lens through which to interpret evidence of police misconduct.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many videos of people getting arrested. And I’ve seen the outraged public reaction to what appears to be inappropriate use of force by the cops. One overwhelming fact that comes through is that people, whatever the color of their skin, don’t understand how to behave around cops so as to keep themselves safe. People have to stop resisting arrest. This may seem obvious, but judging from most of these videos, and from the public reaction to them, this must be a totally arcane piece of information. When a cop wants to take you into custody, you don’t get to decide whether or not you should be arrested. When a cop wants to take you into custody, for whatever reason, it’s not a negotiation. And if you turn it into a wrestling match, you’re very likely to get injured or killed.</p>
<p>This is a point I once belabored in a <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/racism-and-violence-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast with Glenn Loury</a>, and it became essentially a public service announcement. And I’ve gone back and listened to those comments, and I want to repeat them here. This is something that everyone really needs to understand. And it’s something that Black Lives Matter should be teaching explicitly: If you put your hands on a cop—if you start wrestling with a cop, or grabbing him because he’s arresting your friend, or pushing him, or striking him, or using your hands in way that can possibly be interpreted as your reaching for a gun—you are likely to get shot in the United States, whatever the color of your skin.</p>
<p>As I said, when you’re with a cop, there is always a gun out in the open. And any physical struggle has to be perceived by him as a fight for the gun. A cop doesn’t know what you’re going to do if you overpower him, so he has to assume the worst. Most cops are not confident in their ability to physically control a person without shooting him—for good reason, because they’re not well trained to do that, and they’re continually confronting people who are bigger, or younger, or more athletic, or more aggressive than they are. Cops are not superheroes. They’re ordinary people with insufficient training, and once things turn physical they cannot afford to give a person who is now assaulting a police officer the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>This is something that most people seem totally confused about. If they see a video of somebody trying to punch a cop in the face and the person’s unarmed, many people think the cop should just punch back, and any use of deadly force would be totally disproportionate. But that’s not how violence works. It’s not the cop’s job to be the best bare-knuckled boxer on Earth so he doesn’t have to use his gun. A cop can’t risk getting repeatedly hit in the face and knocked out, because there’s always a gun in play. This is the cop’s perception of the world, and it’s a justifiable one, given the dynamics of human violence.</p>
<p>You might think cops shouldn’t carry guns. Why can’t we just be like England? That’s a point that can be debated. But it requires considerable thought in a country where there are over 300 million guns on the street. The United States is not England.</p>
<p>Again, really focus on what is happening when a cop is attempting to arrest a person. It’s not up to you to decide whether or not you should be arrested. Does it matter that you know you didn’t do anything wrong? No. And how could that fact be effectively communicated in the moment by your not following police commands? I’m going to ask that again: How could the fact that you’re innocent, that you’re not a threat to cop, that you’re not about to suddenly attack him or produce a weapon of your own, how could those things be effectively communicated at the moment he’s attempting to arrest you by your resisting arrest?</p>
<p>Unless you called the cops yourself, you never know what situation you’re in. If I’m walking down the street, I don’t know if the cop who is approaching me didn’t get a call that some guy who looks like Ben Stiller just committed an armed robbery. I know I didn’t do anything, but I don’t know what’s in the cop’s head. The time to find out what’s going on—the time to complain about racist cops, the time to yell at them and tell them they’re all going to get fired for their stupidity and misconduct—is after cooperating, at the police station, in the presence of a lawyer, preferably. But to not comply in the heat of the moment, when a guy with the gun is issuing commands—this raises your risk astronomically, and it’s something that most people, it seems, just do not intuitively understand, even when they’re not in the heat of the moment themselves, but just watching video of other people getting arrested.</p>
<p>Ok. End of public-service announcement.</p>
<p>The main problem with using individual cases, where black men and women have been killed by cops, to conclude that there is an epidemic of racist police violence in our society, is that you can find nearly identical cases of white suspects being killed by cops, and there are actually more of them.</p>
<p>In 2016, John McWhorter wrote a <a href="https://time.com/4404987/police-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">piece</a> in Time Magazine about this.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of what he wrote:</p>
<p>“The heart of the indignation over these murders is a conviction that racist bias plays a decisive part in these encounters. That has seemed plausible to me, and I have recently challenged those who disagree to present a list of white people killed within the past few years under circumstances similar to those that so enrage us in cases such as what happened to Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Walter Scott, Sam Debose, and others.”</p>
<p>So, McWhorter issued that challenge, as he said, and he was presented with the cases [<a href="https://youtu.be/EPxNUKw0kV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/VBUUx0jUKxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6KhRcIOuurI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIDEO</a>]. But there’s no song about these people, admonishing us to say their names. And the list of white names is longer, and I don’t know any of them, other than Tony Timpa. I know the black names. In addition to the ones I just read from McWhorter’s article, I know the names of Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, and Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile, and now, of course, I know the name of George Floyd. And I’m aware of many of the details of these cases where black men and women have been killed by cops. I know the name of Breonna Taylor. I can’t name a single white person killed by cops in circumstances like these—other than Timpa—and I just read McWhorter’s article where he lists many of them.</p>
<p>So, this is also a distortion in the media. The media is not showing us videos of white people being killed by cops; activists are not demanding that they do this. I&#8217;m sure white supremacists talk about this stuff a lot, who knows? But in terms of the story we&#8217;re telling ourselves in the mainstream, we are not actually talking about the data on lethal police violence.</p>
<p>So back to the data: Again, cops kill around 1000 people every year in the United States. About 25 percent are black. About 50 percent are white. The data on police homicide are all over the place. The federal government does not have a single repository for data of this kind. But they have been pretty carefully tracked by outside sources, like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>, for the last 5 years. These ratios appear stable over time. Again, many of these killings are justifiable, we’re talking about career criminals who are often armed and, in many cases, trying to kill the cops. Those aren’t the cases we’re worried about. We’re worried about the unjustifiable homicides.</p>
<p>Now, some people will think that these numbers still represent an outrageous injustice. Afterall, African Americans are only 13 percent of the population. So, at most, they should be 13 percent of the victims of police violence, not 25 percent. Any departure from the baseline population must be due to racism.</p>
<p>Ok. Well, that sounds plausible, but consider a few more facts:</p>
<p>Blacks are 13 percent of the population, but they commit <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 50 percent</a> of the murders and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883">other violent crimes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have 13 percent of the population responsible for 50 percent of the murders—and in some cities committing 2/3rds of all violent crime—what percent of police attention should it attract? I don’t know. But I’m pretty sure it’s not just 13 percent. Given that the overwhelming majority of their victims are black, I’m pretty sure that most black people wouldn’t set the dial at 13 percent either.</p>
<p>And here we arrive at the core of the problem. The story of crime in America is overwhelmingly the story of black-on-black crime. It is also, in part, a story of black-on-white crime. For more than a generation, crime in America really hasn’t been a story of much white-on-black crime. [Some listeners mistook my meaning here. I&#8217;m not denying that most violent crime is intraracial. So, it&#8217;s true that most white homicide victims are killed by white offenders. Per capita, however, the white crime rate is much lower than the black crime rate. And there is more black-on-white crime than white-on-black crime.—SH]</p>
<p>The murder rate has come down steadily since the early 1990’s, with only minor upticks. But, nationwide, blacks are still <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 times more likely</a> to get murdered than whites, and in some cities their risk is double that. And <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/wiener/programs/pcj/files/PoliceandPublicDiscourseBlackonBlackViolence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 95 percent</a> of the murders are committed by members of the African American community. [While reported in 2015, these data were more than a decade old. Looking at more recent data from the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FBI’s Uniform Crime Report</a>, the number appears to be closer to 90 percent.—SH]</p>
<p>The weekend these protests and riots were kicking off nationwide—when our entire country seemed to be tearing itself apart over a perceived epidemic of racist police violence against the black community, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-sees-18-homicides-deadliest-day-60-years/story?id=71150234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">92 people were shot, and 27 killed</a>, in Chicago alone—one city. This is almost entirely a story of black men killing members of their own community. And this is far more representative of the kind of violence that the black community needs to worry about. And, ironically, it’s clear that one remedy for this violence is, or would be, effective policing.</p>
<p>These are simply the facts of crime in our society as we best understand them. And the police have to figure out how to respond to these facts, professionally and ethically. The question is, are they doing that? And, obviously, there’s considerable doubt that they&#8217;re doing that, professionally and ethically.</p>
<p>Roland Fryer, the Harvard economist who’s work I discussed on the podcast with Glenn Loury, studied police encounters involving black and white suspects and the use of force.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> is titled, this from 2016, “An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force.”</p>
<p>Fryer is black, and he went into this research with the expectation that the data would confirm that there’s an epidemic of lethal police violence directed at black men. But he didn’t find that. However, he did find support for the suspicion that black people suffer more nonlethal violence at the hands of cops than whites do.</p>
<p>So let’s look at this.</p>
<p>The study examined data from 10 major police departments, in Texas, Florida and California. Generally, Fryer found that there is 25 percent greater likelihood that the police would go hands on black suspects than white ones—cuffing them, or forcing them to ground, or using other non-lethal force.</p>
<p>Specifically, in New York City, in encounters where white and black citizens were matched for other characteristics, they found that:</p>
<p>Cops were…</p>
<ul>
<li>17 percent more likely to go hands on black suspects</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them into a wall</li>
<li>16 percent more likely to put them in handcuffs (in a situation in which they aren&#8217;t arrested)</li>
<li>18 percent more likely to push them to the ground</li>
<li>25 percent more likely to use pepper spray or a baton</li>
<li>19 percent more likely to draw their guns</li>
<li>24 percent more likely to point a gun at them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more or less the full continuum of violence short of using lethal force. And it seems, from the data we have, that blacks receive more of it than whites. What accounts for this disparity? Racism? Maybe. However, as I said, it’s inconvenient to note that other data suggest that black cops and Hispanic cops are more likely to shoot black and Hispanic suspects than white cops are. I’m not sure how an ambient level of racism explains that.</p>
<p>Are there other explanations? Well, again, could it be that blacks are less cooperative with the police. If so, that’s worth understanding. A culture of resisting arrest would be a very bad thing to cultivate, given that the only response to such resistance is for the police to increase their use of force.</p>
<p>Whatever is true here is something we should want to understand. And it’s all too easy to see how an increased number of encounters with cops, due to their policing in the highest crime neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black, and an increased number of traffic stops in those neighborhoods, and an increased propensity for cops to go hands-on these suspects, with or without an arrest, for whatever reason—it’s easy to see how all of this could be the basis for a perception of racism, whether or not racism is the underlying motivation.</p>
<p>It is totally humiliating to be arrested or manhandled by a cop. And, given the level of crime in the black community, a disproportionate number of innocent black men seem guaranteed to have this experience. It’s totally understandable that this would make them bitter and mistrustful of the police. This is another vicious circle that we must find some way to interrupt.</p>
<p>But Fryer also found that black suspects are around 25 percent less likely to be shot than white suspects are. And in the most egregious situations, where officers were not first attacked, but nevertheless fired their weapons at a suspect, they were more likely to do this when the suspect was white.</p>
<p>Again, the data are incomplete. This doesn’t not cover every city in the country. And a larger study tomorrow might paint a different picture. But, as far as I know, the best data we have suggest that for, whatever reason, whites are more likely to be killed by cops once an arrest is attempted. And a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more recent study</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  by David Johnson and colleagues found similar results. And it is simply undeniable that more whites are killed by cops each year, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to their contributions to crime and violence in our society.</p>
<p>Can you hear how these facts should be grinding in that well-oiled machine of woke outrage? Our society is in serious trouble now. We are being crushed under the weight of a global pandemic and our response to it has been totally inept. On top of that, we’re being squeezed by the growing pressure of what might become a full-on economic depression. And the streets are now filled with people who imagine, on the basis of seeing some horrific videos, that there is an epidemic of racist cops murdering African Americans. Look at what this belief is doing to our politics. And these videos will keep coming. And the truth is they could probably be matched 2 for 1 with videos of white people being killed by cops. What percentage of people protesting understand that the disparity runs this way? In light of the belief that the disparity must run the other way, people are now quite happy to risk getting beaten and arrested by cops themselves, and to even loot and burn businesses. And most people and institutions are supporting this civil unrest from the sidelines, because they too imagine that cops are killing black people in extraordinary numbers. And all of this is calling forth an authoritarian response from Trump—and leading to more examples of police violence caught on video.</p>
<p>As I hope I’ve made clear, we need police reform—there’s no question about this. And some of the recent footage of the police attacking peaceful protests is outrageous. Nothing I just said should signify that I’m unaware of that. From what I’ve seen—and by the time I release this podcast, the character of all this might have changed—but, from what I’ve seen, the police were dangerously passive in the face of looting and real crime, at least in the beginning. In many cities, they just stood and watched society unravel. And then they were far too aggressive in the face of genuinely peaceful protests. This is a terrible combination. It is the worst combination. There’s no better way to increase cynicism and anger and fear, on all sides.</p>
<p>But racializing how we speak about the problem of police violence, where race isn’t actually the relevant variable—again, think of Tony Timpa— this has highly negative effects. First, it keeps us from talking about the real problems with police tactics. For instance, we had the recent case of Breonna Taylor who was killed in a so-called “no knock” raid of her home. As occasionally happens, in this carnival of moral error we call “the war on drugs,” the police had the wrong address, and they kicked in the wrong door. And they wound up killing a totally innocent woman. But this had nothing to do with race. The problem is not, as some commentators have alleged, that it’s not safe to be “sleeping while black.” The problem is that these no-knock raids are an obscenely dangerous way of enforcing despicably stupid laws. White people die under precisely these same circumstances, and very likely in greater numbers (I don’t have data specifically on no-knock raids, but we can assume that the ratio is probably conserved here).</p>
<p>Think about how crazy this policy is in a nation where gun ownership is so widespread. If someone kicks in your door in the middle of the night, and you’re a gun owner, of course you’re going to reach for your gun. That’s why you have a gun in the first place. The fact that people bearing down on you and your family out of the darkness might have yelled “police” (or might have not yelled “police”; it’s alleged in some of these cases that they don’t yell anything)—the fact that someone yells “police” isn’t necessarily convincing. Anyone can yell “police.” And, again, think of the psychology of this: If the police have the wrong house, and you know there is no reason on earth that real cops would take an interest in you, especially in the middle of the night, because you haven’t done anything (you’re not the guy running a meth lab)—and now you’re reaching for your gun in the dark—of course, someone is likely to get killed. This is not a racial issue. It’s a terrible policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the process of police reform isn’t straightforward—and it is made massively more complicated by what’s happening now. Yes, we will be urging police reform in a very big way now, that much seems clear. But Roland Fryer <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has also shown</a> that investigations of the cops, in a climate where viral videos and racial politics are operating, have dramatic effects, many of which are negative.</p>
<p>He studied the aftermath of the investigations into police misconduct that followed the killings Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, and Lequan McDonald, and found that, for reasons that seem pretty easy to intuit, proactive police contact with civilians decreases drastically, sometimes by as much 100 percent, once these investigations get started. This is now called “The Ferguson Effect.” The police still answer 911 calls, but they don’t investigate suspicious activity in the same way. They don’t want to wind up on YouTube. And when they alter their behavior like this, homicides go up. Fryer estimates that the effects of these few investigations translated into 1000 extra homicides, and almost 40,000 more felonies, over the next 24 months in the US. And, of course, most of the victims of those crimes were black. One shudders to imagine the size of the Ferguson effect we’re about to see nationwide… I’m sure the morale among cops has never been lower. I think it’s almost guaranteed that cops by the thousands will be leaving the force. And it will be much more difficult to recruit good people.</p>
<p>Who is going to want to be a cop now? Who could be idealist about occupying that role in society? It seems to me that the population of people who will become cops now will be more or less indistinguishable from the population of people who become prison guards. I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s a difference there, and I think we&#8217;re likely to see that difference expressed in the future. It&#8217;s a grim picture, unless we do something very creative here.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a real question about how we can reform police departments, and get rid of bad cops, without negatively impacting the performance of good cops? That’s a riddle we have to solve—or at least we have to understand what the trade-offs are here.</p>
<p>Why is all of this happening now? Police killings of civilians have gone way down. And they are rare events. They are 1/10,000 level events, if measured by arrests. 1/50-60,000 level events if measured by police encounters. And the number of unarmed people who are killed is smaller still. Around 50 last year, again, more were white than black. And not all unarmed victims are innocent. Some get killed in the act of attacking the cops.  [<a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/05/19/breaking-officer-involved-shooting-in-buckingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/local/outreach/back-to-school/officer-involved-shooting-in-adair-county-oklahoma/527-e8cdc435-dcd0-429c-962f-b2c82c22068e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article36802032.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EXAMPLE</a>]</p>
<p>Again, the data don’t tell a clean story, or the whole story. I see no reason to doubt that blacks get more attention from the cops—though, honestly, given the distribution of crime in our society, I don’t know what the alternative to that would be. And once the cops get involved, blacks are more likely to get roughed up, which is bad. But, again, it simply isn’t clear that racism is the cause. And contrary to everyone’s expectations, whites seem more likely to get killed by cops. Actually, one factor seems to be that whites are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15877.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 times more likely</a> to commit “suicide by cop” (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 times more likely</a> to commit suicide generally). What’s going on there? Who knows?</p>
<p>There’s a lot we don’t understand about these data. But ask yourself, would our society seem less racist if the disparity ran the other way? Is less physical contact, but a greater likelihood of getting shot and killed a form of white privilege? Is a higher level of suicide by cop, and suicide generally, a form of white privilege? We have a problem here that, read either way, you can tell a starkly racist narrative.</p>
<p>We need ethical, professional policing, of course. But the places with the highest crime in our society need the most of it. Is there any doubt about that? In a city like Milwaukee, blacks are 12 times more likely to get murdered than whites [Not sure where I came by this number, probably a lecture or podcast. It appears the rate is closer to <a href="https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/01/12/gun-homicides-milwaukee-has-two-thirds-of-states-gun-killings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 times more likely</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/07/13/residential-segregation-associated-with-black-white-disparity-in-firearm-homicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 times more likely</a> in Wisconsin as a whole—SH], again, they are being killed by other African Americans, nearly 100 percent of the time. I think the lowest figure I’ve seen is 93 percent of the time. [As noted above, more recent data suggest that it’s closer to 90 percent]. What should the police do about this? And what are they likely to do now that our entire country has been convulsed over one horrific case of police misconduct?</p>
<p>We need to lower the temperature on this conversation, and many other conversations, and understand what is actually happening in our society.</p>
<p>But instead of doing this, we now have a whole generation of social activists who seem eager to play a game of chicken with the forces of chaos. Everything I said about the problem of inequality and the need for reform stands. But I think that what we are witnessing in our streets, and on social media, and even in the mainstream press, is a version of mass hysteria. And the next horrific video of a black person being killed by cops won’t be evidence to the contrary. And there will be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a>. There are 10 million arrests every year. There will always be another video.</p>
<p>And the media has turned these videos into a form of political pornography. And this has deranged us. We’re now unable to speak or even think about facts. The media has been poisoned by bad incentives, in this regard, and social media doubly so.</p>
<p>In the mainstream of this protest movement, it’s very common to hear that the only problem with what is happening in our streets, apart from what the cops are doing, is that some criminal behavior at the margins—a little bit of looting, a little bit of violence—has distracted us from an otherwise necessary and inspiring response to an epidemic of racism. Most people in the media have taken exactly this line. People like Anderson Cooper on CNN or the editorial page of the New York Times or public figures like President Obama or Vice President Biden. The most prominent liberal voices believe that the protests themselves make perfect moral and political sense, and that movements like Black Lives Matter are guaranteed to be on the right side of history. How could anyone who is concerned about inequality and injustice in our society see things any other way? How could anyone who isn’t himself racist not support Black Lives Matter?</p>
<p>But, of course, there’s a difference between slogans and reality. There’s a difference between the branding of a movement and its actual aims. And this can be genuinely confusing. That’s why propaganda works. For instance, many people assume there’s nothing wrong with ANTIFA, because this group of total maniacs has branded itself as “anti-fascist.” What could be wrong with being anti-fascist? Are you pro fascism?</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem with Black Lives Matter—though, happily, unlike ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter actually seems committed to peaceful protest, which is hugely important. So the problem I’m discussing is more ideological, and it’s much bigger than Black Lives Matter—though BLM is its most visible symbol of this movement. The wider issue is that we are in the midst of a public hysteria and moral panic. And it has been made possible by a near total unwillingness, particularly on the Left, among people who value their careers and their livelihoods and their reputations, and fear being hounded into oblivion online—this is nearly everyone left-of-center politically. People are simply refusing to speak honestly about the problem of race and racism in America.</p>
<p>We are making ourselves sick. We are damaging our society. And by protesting the wrong thing, even the slightly wrong thing, and unleashing an explosion of cynical criminality in the process—looting that doesn’t even have the pretense of protest—the Left is empowering Trump, whatever the polls currently show. And if we are worried about Trump’s authoritarian ambitions, as I think we really should be, this is important to understand. He recently had what looked like paramilitary troops guarding the White House. I don’t know if we found out who those guys actually were, but that was genuinely alarming. But how are Democrats calls to “abolish the police” going to play to half the country that just watched so many cities get looted? We have to vote Trump out of office and restore the integrity of our institutions. And we have to make the political case for major reforms to deal with the problem of inequality—a problem which affects the black community most of all.</p>
<p>We need police reform; we need criminal justice reform; we need tax reform; we need health care reform; we need environmental reform—we need all of these things and more. And to be just, these policies will need to reduce the inequality in our society. If we did this, African Americans would benefit, perhaps more than any other group. But it’s not at all clear that progress along these dimensions primarily entails us finding and eradicating more racism in our society.</p>
<p>Just ask yourself, what would real progress on the problem of racism look like? What would utter progress look like?</p>
<p>Here’s what I think it would look like: More and more people (and ultimately all people) would care less and less (and ultimately not at all) about race. As I’ve said before in various places, skin color would become like hair color in its political and moral significance—which is to say that it would have none.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you don’t agree with that aspiration. Maybe you think that tribalism based on skin color can’t be outgrown or shouldn’t be outgrown. Well, if you think that, I’m afraid I don’t know what to say to you. It’s not that there’s nothing to say, it’s just there is so much we disagree about, morally and politically, that I don’t know where to begin. So that debate, if it can even be had, will have to be left for another time.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this conversation, I have to assume that you agree with me about the goal here, which is to say that you share the hope that there will come a time where the color of a person’s skin really doesn’t matter. What would that be like?</p>
<p>Well, how many blondes got into Harvard this year? Does anyone know? What percentage of the police in San Diego are brunette? Do we have enough red heads in senior management in our Fortune 500 companies? No one is asking these questions, and there is a reason for that. No one cares. And we are right not to care.</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which people cared about hair color to the degree that we currently care—or seem to care, or imagine that others care, or allege that they secretly care—about skin color. Imagine a world in which discrimination by hair color was a thing, and it took centuries to overcome, and it remains a persistent source of private pain and public grievance throughout society, even where it no longer exists. What an insane misuse of human energy that would be. What an absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p>The analogy isn’t perfect, for a variety of reasons, but it’s good enough for us to understand what life would be like if the spell of racism and anti-racism were truly broken. The future we want is not one in which we have all become passionate anti-racists. It’s not a future in which we are forever on our guard against the slightest insult—the bad joke, the awkward compliment, the tweet that didn’t age well. We want to get to a world in which skin color and other superficial characteristics of a person become morally and politically irrelevant. And if you don’t agree with that, what did you think Martin Luther King Jr was talking about?</p>
<p>And, finally, if you’re on the Left and don’t agree with this vision of a post-racial future, please observe that the people who agree with you, the people who believe that there is no overcoming race, and that racial identity is indissoluble, and that skin color really matters and will always matter—these people are white supremacists and neo-Nazis and other total assholes. And these are also people I can’t figure out how to talk to, much less persuade.</p>
<p>So the question for the rest of us—those of us who want to build a world populated by human beings, merely—the question is, how do we get there? How does racial difference become uninteresting? Can it become uninteresting by more and more people taking a greater interest in it? Can it become uninteresting by becoming a permanent political identity? Can it become uninteresting by our having thousands of institutions whose funding (and, therefore, very survival) depends on it remaining interesting until the end of the world?</p>
<p>Can it become less significant by being granted more and more significance? By becoming a fetish, a sacred object, ringed on all sides by taboos? Can race become less significant if you can lose your reputation and even your livelihood, at any moment, by saying one wrong word about it?</p>
<p>I think these questions answer themselves. To outgrow our obsession with racial difference, we have outgrow our obsession with race. And you don’t do that by maintaining your obsession with it.</p>
<p>Now, you might agree with me about the goal and about how a post-racial society would seem, but you might disagree about the path to get there—the question of what to do next. In fact, one podcast listener wrote to me recently to say that while he accepted my notion of a post-racial future, he thinks it’s just far too soon to talk about putting racial politics behind us. He asked me to imagine just how absurd it would have been to tell Martin Luther King Jr, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, that the path beyond racism requires that he become less and less obsessed with race.</p>
<p>That seems like a fair point, but Coleman Hughes has drawn my attention to a string of MLK quotes that seem to be just as transcendent of racial identity politics as I’m hoping to be here. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1087593991976243200?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see these quotations</a> on his Twitter feed. None of those statements by King would make sense coming out of Black Lives Matter at the moment.</p>
<p>In any case, as I said, I think we are living in a very different time than Martin Luther King was. And what I see all around me is evidence of the fact that we were paying an intolerable price for confusion about racism, and social justice generally—and the importance of identity, generally—and this is happening in an environment where the path to success and power for historically disadvantaged groups isn’t generally barred by white racists who won&#8217;t vote for them, or hire them, or celebrate their achievements, or buy their products, and it isn’t generally barred by laws and policies and norms that are unfair. There is surely still some of that. But there must be less of it now than there ever was.</p>
<p>The real burden on the black community is the continued legacy of inequality—with respect to wealth, and education, and health, and social order—levels of crime, in particular, and resulting levels of incarceration, and single-parent families—and it seems very unlikely that these disparities, whatever their origin in the past, can be solved by focusing on problem of lingering racism, especially where it doesn&#8217;t exist. And the current problem of police violence seems a perfect case in point.</p>
<p>And yet now we’re inundated with messages from every well-intentioned company and organization singing from the same book of hymns. Black Lives Matter is everywhere. Of course, black lives matter. But the messaging of this movement about the reality of police violence is wrong, and it’s creating a public hysteria.</p>
<p>I just got a message from the American Association for the Advancement of Science talking about fear of the other. The quote from the email: “Left unchecked, racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of the other can enter any organization or community – and destroy the foundations upon which we must build our future.” Ok, fine. But is that really the concern in the scientific community right now, “unchecked racism, sexism, and homophobia.” Is that really what ails science in the year 2020? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you the fear of the other that does seem warranted, everywhere, right now. It&#8217;s the other who has rendered him or herself incapable of dialogue. It’s the other who will not listen to reason, who has no interest in facts, who can&#8217;t join a conversation that converges on the truth, because he knows in advance what the truth must be. We should fear the other who thinks that dogmatism and cognitive bias aren’t something to be corrected for, because they’re the very foundations of his epistemology.  We should fear the other who can&#8217;t distinguish activism from journalism or politics from science. Or worse, can make these distinctions, but refuses to. And we’re all capable of becoming this person. If only for minutes or hours at a time. And this is a bug in our operating system, not a feature. We have to continually correct for it.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking things that many of us learned when the Covid-19 pandemic was first landing on our shores, and we were weighing the pros and cons of closing the schools, was that for tens of millions of American kids, going to school represents the only guarantee of a decent meal on any given day. I’m pretty confident that most of the kids we’re talking about here aren’t white. And whatever you think about the opportunities in this country and whatever individual success stories you can call to mind, there is no question that some of us start on third base, or second base. Everyone has a lot to deal with, of course. Life is hard. But not everyone is a single mom, or single grandparent, struggling to raise kids in the inner city, all the while trying to keep them from getting murdered. The disparities in our society are absolutely heartbreaking and unacceptable. And we need to have a rational discussion about their actual causes and solutions.</p>
<p>We have to pull back from the brink here. And all we have with which to do that is conversation. And the only thing that makes conversation possible is an openness to evidence and arguments—a willingness to update one’s view of the world when better reasons are given. And that is an ongoing process, not a place we ever finally arrive.</p>
<p>Ok… Well, perhaps that was more of an exhortation than I intended, but it certainly felt like I needed to say it. I hope it was useful. And the conversations will continue on this podcast.</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear Making Sense and Waking Up subscribers—</p>
<p>Those of you who have been listening to my podcast or following me on Twitter know that I’m quite worried about the emerging coronavirus pandemic.

              <h2><a href="https://samharris.org/thoughts-implosion-pangburn-philosophy/">A few thoughts on the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As many of you know, the Day of Reflection conference, scheduled for November 17 in NYC, has been cancelled, and some hundreds of ticket holders are now left seeking refunds.</p>
<p>I was forced to pull out of this event <a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/1043277230632132608">nearly two months ago</a> and have said very little about it since. Now that Travis Pangburn has officially announced that he will be <a href="https://twitter.com/PangburnInspire/status/1062431248205864962">“folding” his touring company</a>, Pangburn Philosophy, I can give a brief account of what happened.</p>
<ol>
<li>I participated in 10 events organized by Pangburn Philosophy between September 2017 and July 2018. I didn’t always approve of the way those events were staged or marketed, but all of them appeared to be successful.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>However, after the cancellation of an August 2018 conference in Auckland, Pangburn seemed intent on running his business off a cliff. He owed a lot of money to several speakers at that point, in the form of unpaid fees and reimbursements. Most egregiously, he seemed less than fully committed to refunding ticket holders for the cancelled Auckland conference.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>At this point, I had two more dates on the calendar with Pangburn in 2018: a dialogue with Brian Greene in Toronto (September 5) and the Day of Reflection conference in New York (November 17). I kept my appointment in Toronto because I was contractually obligated to do so. I also didn’t want to do anything that would harm Pangburn’s ability to pay his mounting debts.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>After Toronto, however, it became clear that Pangburn could not be trusted to put his house in order. Facing a total lack of transparency, and realizing that Pangburn was using my ongoing association with him to book future speakers, I withdrew from the NYC conference on September 21 (as well as from a Vancouver conference scheduled for March 2019). Legally, I was able to do this because Pangburn was in breach of my speaking contract. Ethically, I had a far more compelling reason to back out: I couldn’t promote or participate in an event for which I believed other speakers were unlikely to get paid; nor could I continue to work with someone who still hadn’t given refunds to ticket holders for a conference that had been canceled more than a month before.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>After I withdrew from the NYC conference, my management team asked Pangburn to give us the email addresses of all ticket holders so that we could notify them that I was no longer involved with the event. Pangburn refused to provide this information. However, he assured us that he would notify everyone himself. (I do not know whether he ever did.) He then stopped responding to our emails.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>At the time I pulled out of the NYC conference, I assumed that the revenue from ticket sales was still safely in the box office and that Pangburn would be obliged to issue refunds should the conference fail. That’s how things normally work, especially at a reputable venue like Lincoln Center. It hadn’t occurred to me that New York ticketholders might suffer the same fate as those in Auckland.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>I was left with a legal and ethical puzzle that I could not solve. Again, I had no way to communicate with ticket holders directly, and discussing the chaos surrounding Pangburn on my podcast never seemed like an option. Several friends and colleagues still had events on the calendar with him, and I didn’t want to do anything to derail them. In addition, many speakers who were aware of my reasons for pulling out of the NYC conference were still signed on and seemed intent on making it work. I couldn’t see anything to do that wouldn’t risk creating further harms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Pangburn still owes several speakers (including me) an extraordinary amount of money, we were willing to participate in the NYC conference for free as recently as a few days ago, if he would have handed it over to us and stepped away. I have been told that this offer was made, and he declined it.</p>
<p>I find it appalling that so many people were needlessly harmed by the implosion of Pangburn Philosophy. I can assure you that every speaker associated with the NYC event will be much wiser when working with promoters in the future.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

<blockquote><p>PRESS RELEASE MARCH 12 2013</p>
<p>Catholic Church&#8217;s Rights to &#8220;The Work of God&#8221; Stand Trial</p>
<p>On Friday, presumably immediately after a new Pope has been elected, The Danish High Maritime &amp; Commercial Court of Denmark, will make a historical verdict upon who has the rights to use the age old philosophical &amp; theological concept of &#8220;opus dei&#8221; (The Work of God).</p>
<p>The former Pope&#8217;s personal Prelature has claimed sole rights to the concept since the 1980s, right up until it was inevitably challenged by the small Danish card game publishing house, Dema Games, when they registered (and had officially approved), their trademark: &#8220;Opus-Dei: Existence After Religion&#8221;. A name that has &#8220;everything to do with the philosophical connotations, and nothing to do with the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei&#8221; , Managing Director, Mark Rees-Andersen says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Dema Games, and their Pro Bono lawyer Janne Glæsel from the prestigious Copenhagen-based law firm, Gorrissen Federspiel, has chosen to counter-sue the Prelature, which now might lose their rights to their EU-trademark, which due to EU-law, the Danish court has authority to make rulings on behalf of.  The sue was an immediate media security event.  Federspiel was last seen with a team of <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-york-city-guard-services/">event security Manhattan</a> escorting him due to this new law.  In effect, he has his own concierge security service.</p>
<p>Why the sub-division of the Catholic Church may lose their rights, is mainly due to the argument, that the Prelature&#8217;s registration was invalid from the very beginning, as no one can legally monopolize religious concepts. The church has since stepped up security and started<span style="color: #222222;"> monitoring specific or heightened terrorist threats or alerts. Since then a security team from <a style="color: inherit; text-decoration:inherit" href="http://www.sentinelmgi.com/new-yorkfire-safety-management/">VIP Protection New York City</a> patrols the outside.  Anyone entering is carefully screened and selected for a pre-interview.</span></p>
<p>The case has been ongoing for four years, and Mark Rees-Andersen has singlehandedly successfully defended his legal rights to his game&#8217;s website in 2009, at Nominet, the authority of domain-rights issues in the UK. Dema Games remains to have ownership of the hyphenated &#8220;opus-dei&#8221; domain, in Denmark, Great Britain, France, Poland, Switzerland, and Sweden.</p>

<p>Best regards / Mvh,</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Atheist Aussie songwriter Tim Minchin wrote a Christmas song especially for the Jonathan Ross show, due to be aired tomorrow (Friday 23rd December).

<p>Everyone was happy with it, until someone got worried and sent the tape to the director of programming, Peter Fincham, who demanded that it be cut from the show.</p>

<blockquote><p>
He did this because he’s scared of the ranty, shit-stirring, right-wing press, and of the small minority of Brits who believe they have a right to go through life protected from anything that challenges them in any way.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is indeed a very disappointing decision. </p>
