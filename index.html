<p class="lead">Yesterday, I gave my first year students a teeny-tiny quiz over the current unit in basic genetics. No biggie, I&#8217;d been hearing some troubling concerns from the class tutor that some of the students were struggling, so this was more of an assessment of how well they were grasping the simplest concepts in Mendelian genetics. Here, I&#8217;ll even let you see the entirety of the quiz: 5 questions, 2 points each.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have a true-breeding diploid organism with the phenotype  AB, and a second true-breeding organism with the phenotype ab. A is dominant to a, and B is dominant to b.</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the genotypes of these two creatures?</li>
<li>You cross these two and obtain a clutch of F1s. What are their genotypes and phenotypes?
</li>
<li>You cross two of the F1s with each other. Predict what the phenotypes and their proportions in the next generation should be, assuming that Mendel’s laws apply.
</li>
<li>You cross one of the F1s with another organism that has the phenotype ab. Predict what the phenotypes and their proportions in the next generation should be, assuming that Mendel’s laws apply.
</li>
<li>You actually do the experiment in #4, you get the following results:<br />AB: 35%<br />Ab: 15%<br />aB: 15%<br />ab: 35%<br />Interpret this distribution.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>See? If you were a student who&#8217;d just suffered through 3 weeks of an introduction to genetics, you&#8217;d probably have absolutely no problem with this. If you&#8217;ve been teaching genetics for a few decades, you could answer this quiz in <em>seconds</em>, in your sleep, while standing on your head. I think that might be part of the problem, because this is stuff I can totally take for granted.</p>
<p>I gave the students 20 minutes. Most of them used the entirety of that time. I scored the quiz that afternoon, and was aghast: mean score was 2.7/10, high score was 8. Yikes. How…? Where have I gone wrong? These are smart, hard-working students, and they missed <em>everything</em>. Then I saw the problem. The quizzes were covered with…</p>
<p><strong><em>PUNNETT SQUARES</em></strong>. Jesus. They tried to solve every problem with a 4&#215;4 Punnett square, which is insane. Punnett squares are a tool for graphically illustrating the outcome of a cross. They are <em>not</em> tools for calculating the results. They are a <em>terrible, slow, clumsy</em> tool for doing that. The textbook is full of &#8217;em, I think because they&#8217;re easy to draw and give the illusion of a comprehensive answer. I&#8217;d shown a few in class, because I had to explain what the textbook was showing them, but I always told them that Punnett squares were <em>terrible</em> and useless, but this is what they knew, probably from high school, and then reinforced by the text, and then I made the mistake of trying to explain what the book figures were showing, and they came away with the impression that this is what geneticists do. It is not. Mendelian genetics are dead simple. You can just treat each locus independently (and they&#8217;re trivial, you can memorize all the possible results if you can hold 3 frequencies in your head), solve for A, solve for B, multiply to get the answer for A &#038; B.</p>
<p>Christ, they&#8217;re trying to mechanically brute-force a solution with 4&#215;4 Punnett squares, and it&#8217;s a disaster.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t blame the students, though, it&#8217;s all on me. I remember being their age and taking Dr Sandler&#8217;s genetics course at the UW, and struggling for the first few weeks, until suddenly the light bulb flicked on in my head and I saw how easy Mendel was, and then when he started layering on the advanced stuff, like segregation distorters and epistatic interactions (seriously, try solving those kinds of problems with a Punnett square &#8212; you might be able to assemble some kind of nightmarish diagram, but it&#8217;s not efficient. You can&#8217;t even do linkage with a Punnett square.), it was all just an easy arithmetic modifier added on to the basic concept. But then, Sandler was a brilliant teacher, I&#8217;ve got some catching up to do.</p>
<p>So how to deal with this problem…next week, I&#8217;m going to rewind and go back to the basics, review these elementary problems without Punnett squares anywhere in sight, and actively tell the students that Reginald C. Punnett was of the devil, put on this Earth to confound generations of genetics students. Then, over Christmas break, I&#8217;m going to back over my stored presentations and notes and edit out every mention of the P word. Maybe I should print one out so I can put it on the floor the first day of class and piss all over it &#8212; nah, some administrator would probably complain.</p>
<p>Then, you out there &#8212; yeah, YOU, high school teachers and textbook publishers &#8212; stop poisoning students minds with these abominations. I&#8217;ve never liked them, but I keep using them because they are traditional, and because the books and students come with them preloaded. Just stop it. They&#8217;re pedagogically bad. I&#8217;ve got to explicitly unteach them now.</p>
<p>This is a tragic setback, because what my plan for the course was saying is that I start next week on the developmental biology unit, my favorite stuff, and now it&#8217;s getting bounced back two weeks, and is going to get slammed up against the end of the term. I&#8217;m going to blame Punnett.</p>

But it can also be extremely useful. We use it to package salad leaves, fizz our soft drinks, render animals unconscious before they are slaughtered, and more.</p> <p class="p1">Yet much of Europe has lately been suffering from a CO₂ shortage &ndash; ironic, given that it&rsquo;s in the air. An obvious question has therefore arisen: why don&rsquo;t we pull it directly out of the air? The answer is that CO₂ only makes up 0.04 per cent of our air, and is therefore difficult to extract directly. The research into carbon (dioxide) capture as a means of countering CO₂ emissions has not yet produced a technique that'll extract the quantities needed to support the gas industry. Instead, the main source of CO₂ for industry is a by-product of nitrogen-based fertiliser production. This industry is also heavily reliant on natural gas, so when the gas prices climbed this autumn, fertiliser plants shut down to save on costs. The knock-on <br />effect was a shortage in CO₂.</p> <p class="p1">Nitrogen plays a critical role in the biochemistry of every living thing. It is also the most common gas in our atmosphere. But it is largely inert, which means plants and animals can&rsquo;t extract it from the air. Consequently, a major limiting factor in agriculture has always been bio-available nitrogen.</p> <p class="p1">Most nitrogen fertilisers are produced via the Haber-Bosch process. This combines nitrogen from the air with hydrogen gas to create ammonia. Hydrogen gas is less easy to source than nitrogen. There&rsquo;s plenty of hydrogen about, most obviously as the H in H₂O and CH₄ (methane), but breaking the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen in water, or carbon in methane, requires a huge amount of energy. Hydrogen gas is therefore mainly produced by methane steam reforming, where natural gas and water is heated to about 1,000<span class="s1">℃</span>. The end products are hydrogen gas and CO₂. These can then be separated for their respective uses: the hydrogen into fertiliser, and the carbon dioxide into your salad bags.</p> <p class="p1">So, until carbon capture technology matures, the cost of the fizz in your cola will likely remain tied to the price of natural gas and fertilisers.</p> <p class="p1"><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. <a href="/supportus"><span class="s2">Subscribe today</span></a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

Acceptance there, we&rsquo;re told, indicates a universal admiration, if not envy, of &ldquo;our&rdquo; brand of humour. Chief among recent successes in the US is <em>Fleabag</em>, which in 2019 became the first British production to win best comedy series at the Emmy Awards.</p> <p>But in September, the show became cause for some mild cognitive dissonance in Westminster. Outgoing minister for media John Whittingdale cited the strain of &ldquo;sarcasm&rdquo; running through <em>Fleabag</em> as evidence that it &ldquo;could only have been made in the UK&rdquo;; other comedy-dramas, like <em>Blackadder</em>, had a &ldquo;dash of restraint&rdquo; that was &ldquo;classically British&rdquo;. With broadcasters now receiving more money for dramas from overseas investors, a trend that risked diluting the concentration of &ldquo;Britishness&rdquo; on our screens, it was vital, the minister argued, that such shows continued to be made. In fact, broadcasters would henceforth be required to produce &ldquo;distinctively British&rdquo; content.</p> <p>Cue much criticism in response. But it spoke to a larger question: can humour ever be particular to one society or culture? If so, how can it be so rapturously received by another, especially when that &ldquo;other&rdquo; is a nation often stereotyped as lacking in the fine arts of sarcasm? In a country boasting a kaleidoscope of different cultural traditions &ndash; regional, ethnic, class-based and more &ndash; should we even humour such a notion as &ldquo;distinctively British&rdquo;?</p> <p>The current UK government has done much to frame &ldquo;Britishness&rdquo; as both imperilled by outsiders and something the rest of the world would do well to learn from. For Whittingdale, radio, film and television can amplify the &ldquo;unique identity&rdquo; of British output, and in the process, show the glut of foreign shows that &ldquo;have no real identity, no genuine sense of place&rdquo; for what they are.<br /><br />Most admirers of <em>Fleabag</em> will have marvelled at the economy of the writing or at its masterly marriage of pathos and wit. That Whittingdale&rsquo;s thoughts moved straight to empire building 2.0 reveals something about how the current government sees cultural output as a tool for securing global envy of Britain. Our scriptwriters can package up the constellation of traditions, attitudes, behaviours and otherwise that make up &ldquo;Britishness&rdquo; into half-hour episodes and project them in such a way that the world understands we have something no one else does.</p> <p>But in arguing for a &ldquo;distinctively British&rdquo; sense of humour, Whittingdale undermines the creative ingenuity of the scriptwriters he claims to celebrate. In his view, their material is somehow a product of the nation, while the individual influences they channel play second fiddle.</p> <p>Of course, for a government afraid of its nation&rsquo;s diminishing global status, that kind of story can be useful to tell. But it won&rsquo;t find much of an audience among the creators it claims to celebrate.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. </em><a href="/supportus"><span class="s2"><em>Subscribe today</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

They're all made up of many components, interacting with a touch of randomness and a dash of disorder: the recipe for a complex system. The last two ingredients &ndash; randomness and disorder &ndash; make their behaviour extremely difficult to model and predict.</p> <p>But physicists do enjoy a challenge, and in the 1960s Syukuro Manabe sought to model one such system: energy transfer and transport within the Earth&rsquo;s climate. Manabe&rsquo;s work was the first to explore the interplay between the greenhouse gas effect, the rising of hot air due to convection and the heat released when clouds form. It demonstrated that increasing carbon dioxide leads to rising temperatures closer to the ground, with the upper atmosphere becoming colder. Most strikingly, he showed that doubling the carbon dioxide concentration in the air caused an increase in Earth surface temperature of 2℃. This work seeded the climate change models we have today.</p> <p>A decade later, Klaus Hasselmann took Manabe&rsquo;s work a step further by incorporating the chaos of weather into climate modelling in order to make predictions over time. To represent the rapidly changing weather conditions in the atmosphere, he mathematically built in chance to the model. This paved the way to proving anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are behind today&rsquo;s global warming.</p> <p>For these breakthroughs, Manabe and Hasselmann have been awarded one half of this year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize in Physics. The other half has gone to Giorgio Parisi, whose dedication to understanding disordered and complex materials led to revelations of hidden patterns in the mathematics that could be used to harness predictability in a wide range of complex disordered scenarios, from neuroscience to machine learning, and in the mesmerising sight of a flock of starlings forming a living abstract artwork across the sky.</p> <p>Predicting the unpredictable sounds like a Nobel Prize-worthy achievement. And now it officially is.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. </em><a href="/supportus"><span class="s2"><em>Subscribe today</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

The head of the committee charged with investigating the historic allegations, Jean-Marc Sauv&eacute;, said that up until the early 2000s, the Catholic Church had &ldquo;showed a profound and even cruel indifference towards the victims&rdquo;. Fran&ccedil;ois Devaux, the head of the victims&rsquo; group La Parole Lib&eacute;r&eacute;e, branded the abusers &ldquo;a disgrace to our humanity&hellip; In this hell there have been abominable mass crimes.&rdquo;<br /><br />The committee&rsquo;s report told of how the crimes were systematically covered up by the Church. Around 100,000 of the children were abused by laypeople, such as teachers; the rest &ndash; some 230,000 children &ndash; were victims of the predations of priests and other clergymen. The report put the estimate for the number of abusers at between 2,900 and 3,200.</p> <p>It marks the first public reckoning in France of a phenomenon that has hounded the Catholic Church worldwide. Stories of child abuse by clergymen began to capture public attenton in the US and Canada in the 1980s, before action over allegations was taken in Argentina and Austria in the 1990s. In 2013, the Australian government set up a commission to investigate abuses carried out in its churches, the majority of which were covered up. Germany and Ireland have also been forced to account for clerical abuse of children, much of which was also kept secret for years.</p> <p>With the decades of cover-up in France having now been exposed, the Church finds itself in a precarious situation. Sauv&eacute; has called on it to compensate victims in cases where too much time has passed for prosecutions to take place. In others, court trials for those identified who have yet to be punished are likely.</p> <p>How these revelations are interpreted is vital to determining what kind of response is appropriate. The figure of 330,000 victims shouldn&rsquo;t be read as the sum total of individual crimes; rather, in the words of one campaigner, it is a &ldquo;collective horror&rdquo;. The number of perpetrators, coupled with the extent of the cover-ups, is evidence enough that it would have required the consent of numerous gatekeepers within the Church. Over decades, a culture that permits paedophilia has been quietly nurtured. If people at the top were concerned, they made very little effort to investigate.</p> <p>But if its responses to past scandals are anything to go by, the Vatican would have you think otherwise. In cases where it hasn&rsquo;t been able to silence whistleblowers altogether, it has historically sought to downplay the significance of such allegations, if not deflect them entirely. In 2013, the Vatican angered campaigners after it refused to hand over details on clerical sex abuses to a UN panel investigating the matter, claiming that the move was part of its confidentiality policy. A special summit to discuss child abuse, convened by the Church in 2019, was spun by the Vatican&rsquo;s press office as a marker of the work done to tackle the issue, rather than a critical response to an endemic and deeply harmful problem.</p> <p>Perhaps the French report will finally mark a turning point, a recognition &ndash; surely now unavoidable &ndash; of a deep rot within the Church. That should have happened years ago. After all, what other institution has been so dogged by paedophilia scandals that it has been forced to convene a special summit on the matter? Compensation and court trials may go some way towards redressing its past crimes. But its victims, especially those who still hold close to Catholicism, and who may want their own children to enter the faith, will demand more than this: they will know that the pleas for forgiveness issued by the Church since the report was published are unsatisfactory. A deeper inquiry into what exactly it is within the Church that has allowed such large-scale abuse to take place, and a concerted effort to overhaul its permissive culture, is long overdue.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist winter 2021. </em><a href="/supportus"><span class="s2"><em>Subscribe today</em></span></a><em>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

His book, "Creation. Art Since the Beginning", about the story of art from the palaeolithic to the contemporary era, was published by Bloomsbury in October 2021.</em><strong><br /><br />The first works of art began to appear around 50,000 years ago in different locations around the world - and, curiously, at about the same time. These early artists were not contacting one another across the seas. What explains this seeming coincidence? <br /><br /></strong>I begin <em>Creation: Art Since the Beginning</em> with the remarkable recent discovery that the earliest human images of which we know appeared at roughly the same time at opposite sides of the planet &ndash; in western Europe and Indonesia. They are chance survivals. We will never know what has not survived from that long early period of human creativity. And yet the coincidence of images appearing east and west does suggest that there was some time trigger in human evolution such that, at a certain point on our long journey out of Africa, it became possible and useful to make large, detailed images of animals. Prehistory is the most dynamic area in the study of human image-making, and curiously the youngest, since atomic dating techniques are only around 60 years old. I suspect that the story will become ever more complex and fascinating.<br /><br /><strong>One thing missing from the first 20,000 years of human image-making is images of humans, or even mountains, rivers and trees. Only animals were drawn. Why so? <br /><br /></strong>As so little has survived from prehistory, we can say very little with certainty, although it is striking that almost all of the images that have survived show other animals. This fact, I think, takes us to the heart of human image-making: we paint, draw and sculpt things close to us, things we depend on, things we need to understand, things we love &ndash; and also things we are afraid of, and struggle with. Animals were probably all of these things to early humans. One thing we know is that wherever early humans went they wiped out whole species, surely a way of assuring ascendency on the survival ladder. When I look at these early animal images I see a quest for knowledge, a sense of admiration and love, but also a feeling of mourning, a first confrontation with the inevitability and finality of death.<br /><br /><strong>What might have struck the first visitors to the Chauvet Cave in France or the Leang Tedongnge Cave in Indonesia is the sophistication of the images. One might expect human artistic evolution to more or less mimic a child&rsquo;s artistic maturation: start simple, and over time, evolve a sense of form and finesse. Did the earliest humans have within them an innate flair, or rather is it the case that the earliest sketches and stick figures are probably lost to us? <br /><br /></strong>The earliest images must have evolved over thousands of years. I suspect that they began not with stick figures, but rather with random marks scratched, or natural marks observed, on rocks. Early humans saw how these lines suggested animals, and added to them, gradually creating forms. The earliest images may well have been carved, rather than drawn &ndash; we had been chipping away to create stone tools for hundreds of thousands of years, so that our skill at carving was probably much greater than drawing. This is the important difference with children's drawings, which have their own sophistication: children have yet to develop technique and skill in other parts of life which they can bring into the making of images. The earliest human images were part of the adult life of hunting and survival. Their sophistication shows their importance for life, as well as suggesting the role of instinct in their creation &ndash; something innate to being human that led to their appearance. Perhaps prehistoric children drew like children nowadays. <em>Creation </em>ends with a description of a child's drawing (actually one by our five-year-old daughter) &ndash; children's drawings form the most continuous tradition of art making, although that doesn't mean that they form the beginning of art itself.<br /><br /><strong>You write: &ldquo;Evolving a capacity to think in terms of images was inseparable from the long story of migration and the encounter with nature&hellip;.that had begun long before, in Africa.&rdquo; Can you explain this a bit more?<br /><br /></strong>Well, I think images are always evidence of some kind of encounter. The challenges of migration, of making sense of new environments, of providing some kind of grounding in a strange and often hostile world can be seen throughout the history of human image-making. We can talk with more certainty about later moments of human migration &ndash; the spread of Bantu-speaking people and their tradition of masquerade within Africa, for example, or Protestant migration in the late 16th century to the Netherlands and to Britain, or the migration of African Americans from the south to the north, documented by the American artist Jacob Lawrence in his series &ldquo;The Migration of the Negro&rdquo;. The stories are endless, and they can all be read back, it seems to me, to the earliest moment of human life, our long journey over the planet from our homeland in Africa.<br /><br /><strong>Long ago, the compulsion to create art wasn&rsquo;t a natural human instinct. Now it most certainly is. Has your research into early humans given you a sense of why this instinct has become so powerful within us today? <br /><br /></strong>I don't use the word &ldquo;art&rdquo; in the early chapters of <em>Creation</em>, and in fact use it very sparingly throughout the book &ndash; no more than 20 times, I think. The compulsion to make images has always been with us. The question nowadays is why those images have become so philosophical, intellectual, imaginary, symbolic &ndash; however you want to put it. They certainly have a kinship with the earliest human images, but the comparison has become a clich&eacute; (cave paintings and Picasso, etc.). More interesting is the simple fact of the discovery, barely a hundred years ago, of the antiquity of human life, and of the deep time into which human images fall. This discovery was part of the creation of the contemporary world in ways that are still difficult to fathom, but it does show us how deep-rooted image-making is, and how it distinguishes us as an animal.<br /><br /><strong>From cave painting we turned to other forms of art and representation&mdash;standing stones, and then dolmen. What changes in human social evolution spurred this?<br /><br /></strong>When we settle down in houses we get into interior decoration, choosing wallpaper, carpets, ornaments. Perhaps we lose some of the creative habits of our teenage years. We stop drawing and painting so much. We put the guitar or clarinet back in its case. We embark on a new stage of life which seems more about building a solid world around us, rather than indulging in the fleeting life of images and music. Perhaps this is what happened to the earliest settlers, who saw that survival and the creation of wealth came from a fixed agricultural life, rather than the roving life of a hunter. The earliest standing stone structures are remarkable constructions yet bear images that seem crude compared to the drawings made by hunters for tens of thousands of years. This divide between the vivid nomadic imagery, and the more decorative, utilitarian forms of settled life continues throughout human history. The division between the art instinct and the architecture instinct stand at the beginning of the story told in <em>Creation.<br /><br /></em><strong>Fast-forward several millennia, and depictions of the two world wars of the 20<sup>th</sup> century showed that a willingness to look inwards and interrogate the human body, and the pains inflicted on it, had arrived. Do we see through art the almost lineal development of a capacity for ever deeper self-inquiry? <br /><br /></strong>Images of the body in pain made during the 20th century were by no means new &ndash; you can see such images in Buddhist sculpture, in medieval illumination, in Hellenistic sculpture. But I think the philosophical drive in art since the 20th century has perhaps meant that the conclusions we draw from these works are broader and deeper. I think of Mona Hatoum's video installation, <em>Corps &eacute;tranger, </em>showing an endoscopic probe of the artist's body &ndash; an astounding self-portrait. The drive to knowledge has always been behind the creation of images, and knowledge, as the Greeks were the first to make clear in their lifelike sculpture, is always rooted in the human body.<br /><br /><strong>Art historians are rarely asked to look into the future in the way scientists might be. But does your examination of the past 50,000 years of image-making throw up any patterns that could be used to predict how art might evolve over the coming millennia? <br /><br /></strong>Not really. There are no patterns. Gombrich began his famous <em>Story of Art </em>by rightly saying that there is no such thing as art, but a deeper truth is that there is no story, and so no way of knowing what comes next &ndash; who would want to? In the introduction to <em>Creation</em> I describe a drawing made by the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai (of &ldquo;Great Wave&rdquo; fame), based on a dream he had of a landscape joined together by hundreds of bridges. I use it as a metaphor for the history I tell in my book. The point is to keep moving and keep discovering connections. I can't say what's coming, but I can say what I think will survive, and that is art made with a feeling of belief, and art that interrogates what it means to be human and to encounter the world around us, and the world within. As James Joyce put it in <em>Ulysses</em>, which I quote in <em>Creation</em>: &ldquo;The supreme question about the work of art is out of how deep a life it springs.&rdquo;</p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro.

This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
<p>Last year I collaborated with The Good Thinking Society to set up the Good Magic Awards.<br><br>Our first award focused on performers who use magic tricks to improve the lives of others, including work with disadvantaged groups, hospital patients, and schools. The judges selected two great winners: Megan Swann (who presents a magic show that promotes environmental issues) and Breathe Magic (who support children with hemiplegia by helping them to learn tricks that improve physical and psychological wellbeing).</p>



<p>This year, the award will provide £2,000 to support a new and innovative project that promotes the art of magic. This might, for example, include developing a live or virtual performance, writing a magic-related book or essay, creating a podcast, devising a new form of illusion or presentation, or undertaking research into the history of magic. <br><br>Applicants need to be over 18 years old and currently residing in the UK, and nominations will close at 5pm (GMT) on 20th February 2021.<br><br>To enter, please head over to <a href="https://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/the-good-magic-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Thinking Society</a> now! </p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><a href="https://siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a> has finally taken the step that we all knew was coming, whether we openly admitted it to ourselves or not. The progression was too obvious, the market forces in question too powerful, for this result to have been anything but inevitable. The question was never <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em>, and it turns out that <em>when</em> is today.</p>
<p>Yes, friends, the day has finally come that administrators at SIU have finally wrung that very last drop of blood from the stone by deciding to stop paying contingent faculty altogether.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com">The Professor Is In</a> on Facebook (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>
