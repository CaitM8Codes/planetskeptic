<blockquote><p>The diocese, which is trying to identify people baptized by Arango, set up a FAQ section on its website to confront issues related to the botched baptisms and also created a form for people who were initiated into the church by the priest to complete.</p>
<p>Arango’s error was in saying, “We baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,” when he should have begun the sentence by saying, “I baptize you.”</p>
<p>“The issue with using ‘We’ is that it is not the community that baptizes a person, rather, it is Christ, and Christ alone, who presides at all of the sacraments, and so it is Christ Jesus who baptizes,” Bishop Thomas Olmsted wrote in a mid-January message on the diocese’s site.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think of all the Catholics baptized by a priest who erred in the precise formula: all the priests who stuttered, or sneezed, or paused too long at some random point in the incantation, or worst of all, spoke the rite in the <em>wrong language</em>. I don&#8217;t know what the right language is, but it&#8217;s probably not English or modern Italian. God is very finicky about these things, I guess.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably not German, either, which explains Hitler. Do they say &#8220;du&#8221; or &#8220;Sie&#8221; in the correct version? Maybe they&#8217;ve been getting it wrong all this time.</p>
<p>I wonder if the Catholic Church is more angry at the priest who screwed up the baptisms than they are at the priests who diddled choir boys?</p>

<p class="lead">I played hooky this morning to escort my wife to and from the hospital, where she had a colonoscopy done.

<p>I guess I&#8217;m as ugly on the inside as I am outside, because last time I had this done I was told I should come back every three years. Mary is going to outlast me, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

<p class="lead">Read <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/covid-pandemic-immunocompromised-risk-vaccines/622094/">Ed Yong</a>. He&#8217;s explaining how 3% of the country &#8212; 7 million people &#8212; are immunocompromised for various causes, and vaccine and mask resistance (and outright denial) are putting them at risk. We seem to have just written them all off.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finding and keeping jobs can be very hard for people with chronic illnesses such as lupus, which can leave them feeling powerless to advocate for themselves. With “close to no say about your working conditions, you can only do so much to protect yourself,” Levantovskaya, the literature professor, said. Several immunocompromised people have been told that they’re holding the rest of society back. In fact, it is the opposite: They’re being forced to reintegrate with no regard for their residual risk.</p>
<p>And perhaps worst of all, immunocompromised people began to be outright dismissed by their friends, relatives, and colleagues because of the misleading narrative that Omicron is mild. The variant bypassed some of the defenses that even immunocompetent people had built up, rendered several antibody treatments ineffective, and swamped the health-care system that immunocompromised people rely on. And yet one of Wallace’s patients was told by their sister that no one is dying anymore. In fact, people are still dying, and immunocompromised people disproportionately so. Ignoring that sends an implicit message: Your lives don’t matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>The pandemic is <em>not over</em>, despite people insisting they&#8217;re done with COVID. COVID&#8217;s not done with us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on the Washington Post, they dedicate a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/02/14/unvaccinated-pregnant-mom-covid-strokes-texas/">long article to Chris Crouch</a>. &#8220;Who?&#8221; you might ask. I did. Reading the article didn&#8217;t help explain why he gets all the attention. He and his wife Diana were deniers.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the vaccines came along, Chris became outspoken against them, espousing views that were common in his workplace and much of Texas but that put him at odds with his mother, sister and the close friends he had grown up with in the Heights, a liberal bastion in Houston. Despite his family’s pleading, Chris and Diana were adamant they did not need to be vaccinated. They did wear masks, but only when required.</p>
<p>Chris felt that vaccine mandates infringed on personal liberties, a perspective promoted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other prominent Republicans. And Chris and Diana also worried that the shots had been developed too quickly. As he liked to say, “God gave us our immune system and we can fight the viruses with our own immune system.” Diana, meanwhile, was leery of anything that might hurt the developing baby she carried. She knew that early stories linking the vaccines to miscarriage and infertility were false, but thought avoiding them was the prudent thing to do, like skipping wine, raw fish and unpasteurized cheese — especially given some of the medical community’s early hesitation. The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommend that all pregnant people get vaccinated.</p></blockquote>
<p>So…stupid asshole with the usual array of bogus arguments.</p>
<p>But then, it turns out that <em>pregnancy</em> is one of those complicating factors for COVID-19. Diana came down with a savage case, spends months on a ventilator and in a coma, has a series of small strokes, her lung collapses, the doctors expect that her chances of survival are very, very low, and that the pregnancy was a seriously debilitating factor.</p>
<p>Chris Crouch decides &#8220;he had to try to save them both.&#8221; That was a jarring statement. <em>HE</em> is going to save his wife and the fetus? I don&#8217;t know that there is much <em>he</em> could do, and further, his wife was unconscious and on a ventilator, the doctors and nurses were doing all the work. I guess he alone decided that he would maintain the elevated risk for his wife. If I were in a similar situation, I&#8217;d have instantly made a different choice, but ultimately would have wanted my wife&#8217;s opinion. It&#8217;s her body, her life, the husband is not the one suffering and close to dying.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I didn’t know if one or the other was going to live, or both were going to die,” he said. “I didn’t know if I was going to go back home without anybody.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh no! Pity poor Chris Crouch! Then he has a revelation.</p>
<blockquote><p>During those long hours alone, he struggled with how strongly he had held to beliefs about the vaccines without really examining them. Increasingly, he felt a responsibility to warn others about his mistakes, so he began writing to friends, family and even strangers on Facebook, urging them to get the shots. Somewhere along the way, he got vaccinated himself.</p>
<p>“When you sit there and you see your wife on life support because of covid, you throw out politics,” he said later. “None of that matters anymore.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus christ. Almost a million dead in the US alone, with doctors and scientists telling you all along that this was a serious disease and that precautions are necessary, and now, at the last minute, when one person close to you is dying of the disease you belittle, <em>NOW</em> you decide maybe you could have been wrong, and that you shouldn&#8217;t have let <em>your</em> politics wreck public health policy. You dumbass. You goddamn selfish, self-centered, poisonous little asshole.</p>
<p>Then, the icing on the cake: Chris Crouch gets a whole long story in the Washington Post, entirely centered on him, on his struggle, his encounter with COVID, his difficult months watching his wife wasting away in a hospital bed, his wrestling with his conscience. It&#8217;s all him, him, him, him.</p>
<p>His wife survived. Her baby survived, delivered by C-section in the midst of her suffering. Why wasn&#8217;t <em>she</em> the heart of this story? Fuck Chris Crouch. He&#8217;s one of the reasons COVID has been as crippling and deadly as it has been, and I am totally out of patience and sympathy with his kind.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p><em><img title="An island in the Kiribati atoll in the South Pacific (Flickr/Charly W. Karl) " src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/12644930893_b0dd6ec54e_b.jpg" height="640" alt="Kiribati" width="1024" /></em></p> <p><em>Atossa Araxia Abrahamian is a US-based journalist and author of &ldquo;The Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen&rdquo;. She is working on a second book on extraterritorial jurisdictions for Riverhead Books.</em></p> <p><strong>The first nations to become uninhabitable as seas rise will be small island states like Kiribati in the South Pacific, home to some 115,000 people. Under current legal regimes, what will happen to the citizenship status of inhabitants once they are forced to migrate? </strong></p> <p>We know that rising sea levels will force many, many people to move. The vast majority of them will be internally displaced, but some will have to leave their homes for other countries because the environments they live in will be unsuitable for living. Still, there&rsquo;s no reason why these individuals would necessarily become <em>stateless </em>in this process &shy;&ndash; at least in the foreseeable future &ndash; since countries like Kiribati or Vanuatu are unlikely to disappear entirely. If the past behaviour of nations tells us anything, we can safely assume they will cling to their statehood with all their might.</p> <p>International law seems, for now, to be on their side. There&rsquo;s no minimum landmass for a country to be considered a state, so even if coastlines erode and landmass is diminished, I don&rsquo;t see the UN stepping in and un-recognising a country just because it got smaller or lost a significant portion of its population. If it did that, it would have to evict the Holy See, which barely covers half a square kilometre. So, for a while at least this question is academic.</p> <p>There is all the same a threshold at which what&rsquo;s known as a juridical &ldquo;island&rdquo; becomes a juridical &ldquo;rock&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s not theoretically impossible for an island nation to get downgraded. That will happen when it can no longer sustain life &ndash; environmentally (i.e., no drinking water) or economically (no way for people to make a living.) I also really can&rsquo;t imagine states forfeiting their sovereignty for lack of land or population. Countries have been governed from abroad during wartime, for example. What is more likely is that nations will build artificial islands to replace the submerged ones &ndash; the Maldives is doing this right now, and states like Singapore and China have also &ldquo;reclaimed&rdquo; parts of the sea to extend their own territorial reach, even without this existential threat.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s tempting to jump to wild conclusions and solutions to the problem of submerged islands, but as novel as these situations are, we&rsquo;re dealing with much more prosaic and intractable problems: how to make sure people in dangerous situations find a safe landing place where they can live, work, get an education and have a normal life.</p> <p><strong>The question of future citizenship is often sidelined in discussions around the effects of the climate crisis, which tends to focus on direct material impacts &ndash; flooding, drought, food shortages, and so on. But what will the lived experiences of those fleeing sinking states to other countries be? </strong></p> <p>I can&rsquo;t speak to the emotional aspect of losing a homeland to this kind of tragedy, particularly for people with traditions that are inextricably linked to that land. But climate refugees will, on top of this heartbreak, be faced with all of the obstacles that other kinds of migrants deal with: namely, how will they get the right work and residence papers? This will depend on whether individual host nations grant them rights though ordinary immigration channels, or through exceptional visas, like the ones the US grants to citizens of places that have experienced disasters.</p> <p>There are other types of precarity: How will they adapt and integrate into a new society? How will they maintain a sense of their identity &ndash; cultural, national or otherwise &ndash; without a place to go &ldquo;back&rdquo; to? It&rsquo;s not impossible to hang onto heritage even without places or even passports: the Chagossians, who were forcibly displaced from the island of Diego Garcia by the British so that the US could build a military base some 50 years ago, have a thriving community and even a football team in the UK. And of course, Russian emigr&eacute;s after the Revolution did not recognise their new government, were not recognised <em>by</em> the Soviet government, yet maintained an unbelievably rich literary and cultural tradition from abroad.</p> <p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that human cultures are much more than a bit of land, and if given the resources to live comfortable and rich lives in a new place, I don&rsquo;t see them giving up their heritage. The key is to make it possible for people to move safely to places that welcome them. That&rsquo;s a gigantic challenge, even in the absence of climate change.</p> <p><strong>You&rsquo;ve written widely on the uneven global playing field for citizenship eligibility, and especially on the financial elites of the world who can buy passports with ease. Citizenship has long been widely understood as primarily a matter of blood or soil. But how central a role will wealth play as the world heats up?</strong></p> <p>Money will continue to help rich people migrate more easily and keep less rich people in place. Rich people will also look to buy passports, property and land in areas they deem safe or sheltered from the worst effects of global warming. But my prediction here is that there will be more options for moderately well-off people to buy residence or citizenship as populations in Europe age and more states seek to attract educated, working-age populations. This won&rsquo;t do a thing to help the poorest and least privileged people in the world. But money will certainly not be eliminated from the migration equation.</p> <p><strong>Some have advocated for a decoupling of citizenship from territory as one answer to an increase in global statelessness. But what would that look like in reality? </strong></p> <p>This has been done before! In 1922, the head of the UN refugee agency, a Norwegian statesman named Fritzdjof Nansen, came up with what was known as the &ldquo;Nansen passport&rdquo; for people displaced by war and revolution in Russia, Armenia, and beyond. The document was a stateless person&rsquo;s passport, and while it wasn&rsquo;t always as &ldquo;good&rdquo; (in terms of access and acceptance) as an ordinary passport, it allowed close to half a million people to prove their identity, cross borders, and find new homes. Now, you can probably imagine how politically impossible this kind of endeavour would be today, but it&rsquo;s worth remembering that in times of crisis, wild ideas become possible.</p> <p>Since Nansen&rsquo;s day, the international community has passed lots of treaties and conventions to deal with refugees and statelessness, but none of them are quite up to the task of dealing with the climate crisis. The 1951 Refugee convention&rsquo;s standard rationale for a person to be considered a refugee is &ldquo;fear of persecution&rdquo; and it doesn&rsquo;t really apply to, say, an eroding coastline and no means of growing food. Still, there have been plenty of discussions around whether it can be adapted. One argument is that the convention <em>could</em> apply because the victims of climate change <em>become</em> marginalised and at risk of persecution because of their vulnerable position. Climate defenders may also have a claim to fearing persecution when they come up against, say, oil companies or governments defending corporate interests.</p> <p>This convention may prove too outdated; we may have to come up with new ones. But whatever happens, I do think we&rsquo;re going to have to think in less territorial terms. There&rsquo;s always been a premium on land throughout human history, and the paradox of climate change is that preserving it has at once never been more important to our physical survival, nor more important to think beyond its constraints politically and philosophically.</p> <p><strong>Is there any evidence that the world is moving in such a direction &ndash; that the state model is declining? If anything, many nations over the past decade appear to have doubled their efforts to ensure absolute sovereignty and some degree of homogeneity of their populations, so the prospect of new arrivals being given their full legal rights seems to be diminishing. </strong></p> <p>I don&rsquo;t believe the state as an institution is in decline, but states are definitely looking to augment or supplement their territorial footprint with digital and extraterritorial holdings as a way of maintaining and defending their sovereignty. The Bahamas made a splash recently because they opened an embassy in the Metaverse. Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s new NEOM project is promising &ldquo;mixed-reality&rdquo; experience, both in the physical and digital realms, where individuals can access services from far away as well as on the ground. We&rsquo;re seeing crypto-currencies decoupled (in theory) from countries, and even residence decoupled from places, in the case of Estonia, which offers e-residency to entrepreneurs looking to use the country&rsquo;s business and tech infrastructure.</p> <p>And look at us &ndash; we&rsquo;ve been stuck on Zoom meetings in our pyjamas for two years now!</p> <p>Where all this is leading is obviously up in the air, but taken together, with the backdrop of climate disaster, I&rsquo;m inclined to believe that the deterritorialisation of parts of our lives and political systems will continue.</p> <p><em>This is the full version of our Q&amp;A from the New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

In practice, this means that blasting burning fuel downwards gives you enough upwards push to get a rocket-propelled craft off the ground and into space. Once there, it can travel easily through the perfect vacuum of space, reaching impressively high speeds. Voyager 1, launched in 1977, passed through the edge of the solar system in 2012 and is now over 14 billion miles away, travelling at 38,000 mph.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>But for deep space exploration, such as a human mission to Mars or an interstellar probe, we really need to improve the travel time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>For that you need a better propulsion system. Relying on chemical combustion alone means carrying heavy fuel with you and that&rsquo;s a non-starter for space missions. Instead, a way forward is to use plasma: a fourth state of matter (along with solid, liquid and gas), so hot that it has broken down into charged particles. Plasma propulsion is much more fuel efficient and can operate for much longer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>So, what&rsquo;s the downside? For optimum thrust the plasma needs to leave the spacecraft as a focused jet. Solutions so far have relied on using cylindrical cavities that guide the plasma, making sure that it doesn&rsquo;t spray out in all directions. Over time, however, the cavity walls will degrade, which does little for its longevity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Results published recently in <em>Applied Physics Letters</em> demonstrate a new approach that doesn&rsquo;t need cavity walls. Instead, a set of electrodes generate a flow of electrons at the edges of the plasma, creating magnetic forces that push back on the natural expansion of the charged particles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory group have already built a mini prototype that produced a focused plasma jet with high thrust-density and improved plasma stability. This is a major development for the future of rocket design. Plasma jets could significantly cut the time it takes to traverse our solar system, making it far more feasible for humans to visit Mars and beyond. <br /><br /><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of our New Humanist spring 2022 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>. </em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

The justification for part of the scheme &ndash; the planting of trees &ndash; is backed by growing evidence of the cooling effects of afforestation. Research conducted at ETH Zurich, reported in November last year, found that areas of some European cities with high tree cover were as much as 12 degrees cooler than those without.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The government&rsquo;s Local Nature Recovery scheme sounds like a win-win: habitats are restored, land surfaces cool, and farmers are financially rewarded for their efforts. But not all are in agreement. The National Farmers Union in Wales has responded to the scheme with alarm. Already, farms in Wales are being sold to private equity firms who, taking advantage of forestry grants, have bought up land in order to plant trees. Farmers there have warned that any afforestation might do more harm than good if it&rsquo;s not properly thought through, especially if conifers &ndash; known to be damaging to soil fertility &ndash; are planted en masse by companies with little understanding of local ecology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>The government has sought to allay another concern. The various projects involved in the scheme won&rsquo;t go ahead, it has said, unless there is certainty that food production won&rsquo;t be affected. Any change in the use of agricultural land inevitably risks affecting the productivity of that land. This concern has global echoes. Oxfam warned last year that if too much afforestation or reforestation takes place over the coming three decades, resultant food price rises will worsen hunger. Globally, the organisation estimated, 350 million hectares of land could be forested without causing any significant disruption to food prices. This was the target set in the so-called Bonn Challenge in 2011. But if tree planting were to be the only strategy used for reaching net zero, five times that surface area, equivalent to all the farmland on the planet, would be required.<br /><br />The risks don&rsquo;t stop there. If tree planting schemes essentially replicate monoculture practices, the UK&rsquo;s already alarming rates of biodiversity loss &ndash; it now ranks among the least biodiverse countries in the world &ndash; could quicken. In 2020 it was reported that 80 percent of commitments made in the Bonn Challenge, which some 40 countries have so far signed up to, were for either monoculture plantations or a limited variety of trees. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br /><br /></span>Promises to ramp up tree-planting were made by several parties in the last UK elections, indicating that this low-cost &ndash; and potentially highly effective &ndash; strategy for reaching net zero had broad support. In the US, even Donald Trump backed the Trillion Trees Campaign while in office. But although it might appear an attractive route to tackling the climate crisis, it&rsquo;s clear there are justifiable fears. In more than a figurative sense then, let&rsquo;s not miss the wood for the trees.</p> <p><em>This piece is a preview from the Witness section of New Humanist spring 2022. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe here</a>. </em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

            <div class="panel-body"><p><img title="Ludwig Wittgenstein&rsquo;s wooden cabin in Skjolden, Norway (Alamy Stock Photo)" src="https://newhumanist.org.uk/images/Witt.jpg" height="691" alt="Witt" width="1097" /></p> <p>One hundred years ago, a slim volume of philosophy was published by the then unknown Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. The book was as curious as its title, <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>. Running to only 75 pages, it was in the form of a series of propositions, the gnomic quality of the first as baffling to the newcomer today as it was then.</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The world is all that is the case.<br />1.1 The world is a totality of facts not of things.<br />1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.<br />1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.<br />1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>And so on, through six propositions, 526 numbered statements, equally emphatic and enigmatic, until the seventh and final proposition, which stands alone at the end of the text: &ldquo;Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must remain silent.&rdquo;<br /><br />The book&rsquo;s influence was to be dramatic and far-reaching. Wittgenstein believed he had found a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to how language and the world relate, that they shared a logical form. This also set a limit as to what questions could be meaningfully asked. Any question which could not be verified was, in philosophical terms, nonsense.<br /><br />Written in the First World War trenches, <em>Tractatus</em> is, in many ways, a work of mysticism. A believer, Wittgenstein regarded part of the task of philosophy as sorting what was sayable from what was unsayable, a demarcation which left God, religion and ethics outside the realm of philosophical thinking. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he wrote in a letter home from the front, &ldquo;the nearness of death will bring light into life. God enlighten me.&rdquo; <em>Tractatus</em> is the fruit of this engagement.<br /><br />Nietzsche wrote that &ldquo;During times of peace the warlike man makes war upon himself&rdquo; but for many thinkers there has been no need to turn inwards. The 20th century, with its two world wars, produced a wealth of philosophers who wrote their work in extremis &ndash; French philosopher Jean Cavailles produced his great work, <em>On Logic and the Theory of Science</em>, as a prisoner of war; Louis Althusser first engaged with Marx during five years interred in Schleswig-Holstein, while Simone Weil fought as part of the Durutti Column in the Spanish Civil War, which coincided with her despair at politics and her shift towards religious thinking.<br /><br />Wittgenstein was 25 years old at the start of the First World War. The son of one of Vienna&rsquo;s richest industrialist families, he studied aeronautical engineering before turning to theoretical mathematics after reading Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s <em>The Principles of Mathematics</em> and Gottlob Frege&rsquo;s <em>The Foundations of Arithmetic</em>. The questions they raised about logic and mathematics left him, he later said, in &ldquo;a constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation&rdquo;.<br /><br />Unable to study under Frege, in 1911 he arrived unannounced at Russell&rsquo;s study in Cambridge, soon dominating his lectures on propositional logic. It was the start of an exhausting, difficult relationship between the two &ndash; Russell loved him as &ldquo;the young man one hopes for&rdquo;, yet described him as an &ldquo;infliction&rdquo;. Wittgenstein credited Russell with saving his life after nine years of loneliness, but his criticism of Russell&rsquo;s work was such that the older philosopher was forced to recognise he could &ldquo;not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy&rdquo;.<br /><br />The ambivalence in their relationship was not unique. Wittgenstein was notoriously solipsistic in his &ldquo;friendships&rdquo; and particularly harsh on those he regarded as intellectually inferior, which soon included Russell and later most other philosophers, with the exception of Frank Ramsey, who first translated<em> Tractatus</em>. <br /><br />But it also often included himself. Tormented by problems of logic, he would feel total disgust with himself when unable to solve them. This self-loathing had a spiritual component: as he put it to Russell, he agonised about two things, logic and his sins, cursed as he was by &ldquo;half talent&rdquo;. Making war on himself had left him suicidal. What he needed was a war outside himself.</p> <h2>Philosophy in a time of war</h2> <p>In August 1914 it arrived. Wittgenstein enlisted and was assigned to an artillery regiment in Krakow on the Eastern Front, part of what his biographer Ray Monk terms &ldquo;one of the most absurdly incompetent campaigns of the early months of the war&rdquo;. Both sides were stationed in the wrong place, which for Wittgenstein meant several months on a ship in the Vistula river awaiting something, anything, to happen. Not only was he isolated; those he was closest to, including his lover David Pinset, were now on the enemy side. As ever, his thoughts turned to suicide.<br /><br />And, as ever, he was stopped. This time, it was by a book. Browsing in a bookshop in Galicia, he chanced upon a copy of Tolstoy&rsquo;s <em>Gospel in Brief</em> &ndash; the Russian writer&rsquo;s retelling of the life of Christ by merging the four Gospels. The book would have a profound influence on Wittgenstein. With it virtually memorised, he would &ldquo;recite Tolstoy&rsquo;s words over and over again in my head&rdquo; while under fire. It produced in Wittgenstein, Monk writes, &ldquo;exactly the kind of personal transformation, the religious conversion, he had gone to war to find&rdquo;. The book, Wittgenstein later wrote, &ldquo;kept me alive&rdquo;.<br /><br />It also informed, dramatically, <em>Tractatus</em>. What was a work on logical symbolism became something much deeper, much wider, much stranger. Nothing in the existence of the mystical contradicted his theories of the logical. In occupying different realms, they shared none of the criteria of validity. They were, he argued, separate. His job was to show in any situation which was which, and ensure that the separation was absolutely enforced. <br /><br /><em>Tractatus</em> introduces what has become known as the &ldquo;picture theory of language&rdquo;. For Wittgenstein there was a basic coherence between the structure of language and the structure of the world. This correspondence &ndash; between, for instance, the sentence &ldquo;the cat sat on the mat&rdquo; and the state of affairs that inspires it (a cat sitting on a mat) &ndash; is what enables language to represent reality. He uses the example of a gramophone record and a musical score. While each has a different materiality, they share a logical form: given the record one could deduce the score, and given the score, one could deduce the recording. Thus the relationship between language and reality.<br /><br /><em>Tractatus</em> opens with &ldquo;The world is all that is the case&rdquo; and &ldquo;The world is a totality of facts, not of things.&rdquo; That is, the &ldquo;world&rdquo; is a totality of that of which we can speak, make propositions about, define. And it is &ldquo;all the facts&rdquo; &ndash; nothing is &ldquo;world&rdquo; which cannot be captured factually, which cannot be described.</p> <p>One instance of a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that cannot be described is how language does, in fact, represent the world. Here Wittgenstein points to a camera: the camera can picture the world, but it cannot picture the mechanisms which allow it to do so. It cannot represent its own method of representation. &ldquo;Propositions can represent the whole of reality, but they cannot represent what they must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it: logical form.&rdquo; Philosophy has no place here. One cannot have a logic of logic; a meta-language is a language.<br /><br />In fact, Wittgenstein writes, philosophy &ldquo;should limit the thinkable and thereby the unthinkable. It should limit the unthinkable from within through the thinkable. It will mean the unspeakable by clearly displaying the speakable. Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly; indeed everything that can be said can be said clearly.&rdquo; <br /><br />What cannot be captured in propositions &ndash; what cannot be said clearly &ndash; is therefore either senseless, in that it does not offer a picture of possible facts, or nonsense, where &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; is that which cannot be described without the description being absurd.</p> <h2>Logical positivism and the Vienna Circle</h2> <p>It was this idea which influenced the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle, whose &ldquo;mission&rdquo; was, like Wittgenstein, to demarcate between what is sense and nonsense, particularly with philosophy. The great unanswerable questions &ndash; about God, freedom, substance, causality &ndash; are unanswerable because they are not genuine questions. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one should ignore, or point out that to speak of it leads only to nonsense. A sentence such as &ldquo;It is raining&rdquo; is verifiable, whereas &ldquo;God is good&rdquo; is not, and is therefore meaningless &ndash; a pseudostatement. One may feel it is true, but one cannot do any more than that. For the logical positivists this was held to be the case for most metaphysical questions, as well as aesthetics and ethics. The job of philosophy is to seek out this nonsense and strip it away from questions of meaning.<br /><br />Where Wittgenstein differs absolutely from the logical positivists is precisely at this idea of nonsense. While agreeing that the unanswerable questions are not genuine philosophical questions at all &ndash; he himself sometimes described his philosophy as &ldquo;therapeutic&rdquo; in that it stopped one philosophising &ndash; this did not mean they could be dismissed. Simply, the truly religious was outside of speech. It could only be &ldquo;shown&rdquo; &ndash; and, as he puts it in <em>Tractatus</em>, &ldquo;what can be shown cannot be said.&rdquo; <br /><br />To call a religious belief or practice &ldquo;false&rdquo; is, to use a basic philosophical term, to commit a category error. Truth and falseness belong to the sorts of &ldquo;facts&rdquo; which make up the world, the meaningful propositions of language. Religious belief &ndash; the mystical &ndash; is not a fact of this sort, and therefore to submit it to the truth tests of propositional logic is incorrect.<br /><br />Wittgenstein here distinguishes between an explanation and an expression. Propositions are explanations, and can be true or false. But an expression, such as a religious belief, cannot. Take the example of pain. I can display pain by moaning or by saying &ldquo;Ouch&rdquo;. Or I can use the sentence &ldquo;I am in pain.&rdquo; The latter shares a grammatical structure with such phrases as &ldquo;It is raining&rdquo;, but it is in fact an expression in exactly the same way that &ldquo;Ouch&rdquo; is an expression. <br /><br />In fact, &ldquo;I am in pain&rdquo; is simply a substitute for &ldquo;Ouch&rdquo; &ndash; it is a replacement, not a description, and it would be absurd for someone to say to me it is false. &ldquo;There are indeed things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical,&rdquo; he wrote. We are in a space, outside of logic, we are where &ldquo;language goes on holiday&rdquo;. Thus &ldquo;To be able to think outside the limit of thought &ndash; to be able to comprehend the mystical &ndash; would require that we think what cannot be thought.&rdquo;<br /><br />Religious belief shares this form: it manifests itself. It cannot be spoken of; rather, it must be shown. To believe in the resurrection is to have a rule to follow, to act as one should when one believes in the resurrection. As Wittgenstein would later argue, to understand a rule is to know what would count as acting in accord with it. A religious belief that does not affect the behaviour of the believer is not a religious belief. <br /><br />Nor is it meaningless. Wittgenstein&rsquo;s June 1915 Notebook breaks off from speculations about logic. He writes: &ldquo;I know that this world exists&hellip; something about it is problematic, which we call its meaning&hellip; this meaning does not lie in it but outside it&hellip; the meaning of life, i.e., the meaning of the world, we can call God.&rdquo; It is one&rsquo;s &ldquo;duty to oneself&rdquo; to act on this belief.<br /><br />And as for religious belief, so for ethics. &ldquo;A certain characteristic misuse of our language runs throughout all ethical and religious expressions,&rdquo; he would say in the only lecture he ever gave outside of his official teaching duties, his 1929 &ldquo;Lecture on Ethics&rdquo;. An ethical position is not that which can be said; rather, again it is that which can be shown. As he puts it in <em>Tractatus</em>, &ldquo;it is impossible for there to be propositions of ethics. Propositions can express nothing that is higher.&rdquo; Or, as he wrote in his war diary, &ldquo;I am either happy or unhappy, that is all.&rdquo;</p> <h2>Wittgenstein&rsquo;s religious turn</h2> <p>In late 1918, Bertrand Russell produced his <em>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</em>. In a footnote about tautologies, he wrote: &ldquo;The importance of &lsquo;tautology&rsquo; for a definition of mathematics was pointed out to me by my former pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein, who was working on the problem. I do not know whether he has solved it, or even whether he is alive or dead.&rdquo; He had not heard from his &ldquo;former pupil&rdquo; since 1915. <br /><br />Wittgenstein had been at the front for most of that time. There, he often placed himself in the most dangerous positions, directly in the line of fire from Allied troops, an action which saw him decorated a number of times. In November 1918 he was captured by Allied forces and spent nine months as a prisoner of war.<br /><br />All the while he continued to read Tolstoy, keep his Notebooks and work on the <em>Tractatus</em>, which was finally published in 1921 while Wittgenstein was working as a primary school teacher in rural Austria. <br /><br />He and Russell had resumed contact, and the latter provided the introduction to the German edition of the <em>Tractatus</em> so as to lend weight to the work of this still unknown philosopher. Unlike Wittgenstein, Russell had not fought in the war, spending the duration in prison as a conscientious objector, an act of its own categorical bravery. Nor, emphatically, did he believe in God. Of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s religious turn he would write: &ldquo;He has penetrated deep into mystical ways of thought and feeling, but I think (though he wouldn&rsquo;t agree) that what he likes best in mysticism is its power to make him stop thinking.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was not until 1929 that Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge, the intervening years spent madly oscillating between &ldquo;stopping thinking&rdquo; and thinking too much. He had, after the sort of long battle which only occurs in academia, been presented with his doctorate on the basis of <em>Tractatus</em>. <br /><br />In his &ldquo;Lecture on Ethics&rdquo;, Wittgenstein described experiences which have an absolute value rather than an instrumental one. The first is being &ldquo;safe in the hands of God&rdquo;; the second is &ldquo;seeing the world as a miracle&rdquo; such that one is impelled to say &ldquo;how extraordinary that the world should exist&rdquo;.<br /><br />This is not, of course, an experience of the world which is exclusive to the believer. One can wonder at the world without believing in God, and one can feel, with Wittgenstein, that there are things which fall outside the bars of the prison of language. That we still ask ourselves unanswerable questions may be a category error in philosophy, and cause for exasperation in a narrow version of science. But we do, and will continue to do so. That we find meaning in literature and music, in ritual and myth, is equally perplexing if all of life is supposed to be rational. And yet we do.<br /><br />In many ways, <em>Tractatus </em>supports a version of the world where mysticism, to use one of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s own metaphors, can be cut away like the rotten bit of an apple. But after 100 years we should still pay heed to Wittgenstein&rsquo;s own reading at the time: &ldquo;My work consists of two parts; that presented here plus all I have not written. It is this second part that is important.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This article is from the New Humanist winter 2021 edition. <a href="/subscribe">Subscribe today</a>.</em></p>       </div><!-- panel-body -->

<p>One section of this 34-page extravaganza was devoted to contemporary magicians and included the cover of a magic magazine featuring the legendary David Copperfield.</p>
<p><span style="color:var(--th-color-primary-base);font-family:var(--th-site-font-body);font-size:revert;">A few years ago, I was in Las Vegas with my friend and fellow magician, Massimo Polidoro. We went to see David Copperfield’s amazing show and he kindly invited us to his secret museum of magic. This stunning collection is housed is a large building on the outskirts of Vegas and contains a jaw dropping collection of apparatus, posters and books. It is the Smithsonian of magic and explores how magic shapes society, inspires technology, and creates a sense of wonder.</span></p>

Afterwards, David and I spoke about producing a book that provides readers with a personal tour of this magical space. Excited by the idea, we enlisted the help of brilliant magician David Britland and amazing photographer (and co-director of David Copperfield’s shows) Homer Liwag. Together, we put together a pitch document and were delighted when Simon and Schuster agreed to publish the book. Not only that, but the wonderful Priscilla Painton agreed to act as our editor.</p>

This 270-page glossy book is our love letter to magic. Filled with Homer’s stunning photographs, it celebrates a group of outsiders who bring a much-needed sense of magic into the world, including the man who fooled Houdini, the woman who caught bullets in her bare hands, and the illusionist who made himself vanish. Along the way we encounter a sixteenth-century manual on sleight of hand, stunning French automata, and even some coins that are said to have magically passed through the hands of Abraham Lincoln.</span></p>
<p>Over forty years ago, 13 year-old Wiseman write a school project on magic and referenced David Copperfield. Today, I am honoured to have worked with this legendary performer and co-authored a beautiful book on the topic. To me, that feels like real magic.</p>

<p>During the experiment, a group 10 to 11-year-old children completed a creativity test that involved coming up with multiple uses for an everyday object. They were then taught how to perform a simple trick in which they showed someone a cube with different coloured sides, asked the person to secretly choose a colour, and then magically revealed their person&#8217;s choice. Finally, they all completed the creativity test a second time. Compared to another group of children who took part in an art lesson, learning the trick significantly boosted the children&#8217;s creativity scores.</p>
<p>Magic tricks often involve lateral thinking and we suspect that learning to perform the illusions encouraged children to think outside of the box.  There is a  need to enhance creative thinking from a young age. Learning magic tricks would be a cost effective, practical, and fun way of teachers and parents boosting children&#8217;s creativity. Maybe in the future, magic will become part of the school curriculum!</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed work was carried out in collaboration with  Amy Wiles and Professor Caroline Watt (Edinburgh University), and published in the academic journal PeerJ.</p>
<p>You can read the paper for free <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/11289/">here</a>, and a general review on magic and education <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8747/">here</a>.</p>

              <h2><a href="https://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/11/went-back-school-higher-ed/">Why I went back to school in Higher Ed</a></h2>
            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p>As I mentioned <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/11/10/sod-is-back-in-business/">yesterday</a>, I&#8217;ve recently gone back to school for an M.Ed in Higher Education. Regular readers may know that I already have a humanities PhD, which raises a pretty obvious question: &#8220;What the hell Dan? Aren&#8217;t you done with school? Why collect yet another degree? Seriously what is wrong with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I decided to go back to school. but most of them ultimately boil down to one thing: the academic job market. I&#8217;ve been writing about my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2014/12/28/on-the-market-i-bespoke-courses/">experiences</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/01/08/on-the-market-ii-digital-footprints/">looking</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/09/on-the-market-iii-byu-doesnt-deserve-my-application-or-yours/">for</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/09/25/on-the-market-iv-paying-for-the-privilege/">a</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/10/19/on-the-market-v-diversity-statements/">job</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/01/17/on-the-market-vi-excellence-in-teaching-and-student-evaluations/">over</a> <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/10/17/on-the-market-vii-job-candidates-are-people-too/">the last few years</a>, and after four years and <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2017/05/05/inexhaustive-list-of-jobs-not-received-with-a-humanities-phd/">dozens and dozens of applications</a>, it became very clear that something had to change if I planned on actually getting a job before retirement age.</p>
<p>I was also getting dangerously close to losing my immigration status in Canada, where I have lived for over twelve years. My three-year postgraduate work visa was set to expire this past summer, and with no employment on the horizon that would satisfy CIC requirements for renewal, going back to school was essentially the only way for me to stay in the country short of marriage (which an immigration lawyer actually suggested).</p>
<p>One would think that earning an advanced postgraduate degree would give someone a leg up in the immigration system, but it turns out this is not always so: immigration nominations for PhD students and graduates come from the individual provinces, and Quebec&#8211;where I studied&#8211;is the only one not to offer them.* And so earning yet another graduate degree in Ontario became the quickest and most straightforward path to finally ending the twelve-year string of short-term temporary visas that have been an omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damoclean sword</a> for essentially my entire adult life.</p>
<p>But why Higher Ed?</p>
<p><a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/04/10/universities-should-be-employing-surplus-phds-as-administrative-staff/">As I&#8217;ve written before</a>, administration is currently the only growth industry in the sector, and I thought it might be useful to have a professional degree that would help me break into that market. I also do honestly believe that schools would benefit from having more administrators who have first-hand experience with teaching and research, and with actual lived experience as graduate students and academic contract workers. What are the chances, for example, that anyone currently working in a university provost&#8217;s office has ever actually <em>been</em> an adjunct and knows what it is like? Or has even been a graduate student any time after the 1980s?</p>
<p>Lastly, I have spent over a decade of my life acquiring and sharpening the tools of critical inquiry, and I think that turning that toolset on higher ed itself is the way I am best qualified to help tackle the many challenges facing the industry. And this goes beyond just literature and research: I have become increasingly interested in helping to actually craft policy that might help to ameliorate some of the problems I&#8217;ve seen and heard about on the ground. This degree is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*For reasons that I&#8217;m sure are totally unrelated to the fact that most international students in Quebec aren&#8217;t native French-speakers.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Hello everyone! Many apologies for my long absence, but things got a little busy for me when I went back to school (yes, again) to actually officially study Higher Education!</p>
<p>The upside for you, dear readers, is that my new studies have provided lots of new grist for the old mill, and I plan to post fairly regularly about my ideas, experiences, and research over the next few semesters. This will include everything from day-to-day experiences in the programme itself to discussions of the existing literature on higher ed to summaries of my own research in the field (and possibly links to full papers for the true masochists among you).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the topics I plan to address in the next few weeks, most of which derive from seminar papers I will be writing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Human Capital Model a Myth? Signalling, Credentialism, and Rent-Seeking in Higher Ed</p>
<p>The Idea of a Stoic University (Or: How to Un-coddle the American Mind)</p>
<p>Transnational Mobility in the Academic Labour Market for the Humanities</p>
<p>Graduate School as the Structural Model for the Theory of Emerging Adulthood</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing you all along with me on this new journey!</p>

            </div><!-- panel-heading -->
            <div class="panel-body"><p style="text-align: center">[Update to the update: SIU has posted a statement on the programme <a href="https://chancellor.siu.edu/messages/04-24-18-university-statement.php">here</a>. As it essentially confirms my suspicions that it is designed to steal soft academic labour from new PhDs by trading on their institutional loyalty and need for affiliation without paying them for their services, I provide the link here but see no need to comment further.]</p>
<p>After publishing <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2018/04/23/and-so-it-has-come-to-this/">my take on the leaked email</a> from SIU Associate Dean Michael Molino yesterday, I read a fair amount of discussion about the issue on social media and faced a little bit of criticism myself for jumping on a viral outrage bandwagon without necessarily having a complete picture of the situation. I still stand by everything I wrote in yesterday&#8217;s post, but I would like to take the opportunity address a few questions and criticisms and clarify exactly what I was and was not claiming in my analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Is this email even real? How do we know it really said everything that ended up in the viral version?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. This website <em>is </em>called <em>School of Doubt</em>, so a bit of skepticism is always warranted. After this question was raised I reached out to <a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">Karen Kelsky</a>, who disseminated the most viral version of the email, to ask about its provenance. She confirmed that it was forwarded to her by an SIU faculty member she knew personally. Epistemically speaking that is good enough for me, but nothing&#8217;s perfect I guess.</p>
<p><b>Is it really fair to target Molino as an individual because someone leaked an email he wrote? Isn&#8217;t this just doxxing that invites harassment?</b></p>
<p>In his capacity as an administrator implementing policy at a state university, Molino is in a position of authority operating in the public trust. This requires transparency and accountability, and I don&#8217;t think sharing his official contact information is doxxing any more than it would be for an administrator at a government agency like the EPA or FCC. Furthermore, email communication at public universities is a matter of public record, both for good and for ill (as I have covered <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/05/24/foia-abuse/">previously</a>). While people may disagree about the ethics of leaking and whistleblowing, it is really not possible to argue that such an email could have been written with any reasonable expectation of privacy. But yes, he&#8217;s probably going to have a bad time and that sucks.</p>
<p><strong>What if Molino isn&#8217;t even ultimately responsible for coming up with the policy?</strong></p>
<p>Well, bluntly, who cares? He is clearly working to implement it. Not to get all Godwinny, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_defence">we&#8217;ve heard that one before</a>. You can write to the Provost instead if you want. I won&#8217;t provide his email but I bet you can find it.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-time adjuncts are not volunteer workers: they are like contractors whose affiliation with the institution does not guarantee them work hours.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>First off there is a terminology problem here. <strong>Zero-hour </strong>contracts are a kind of labour arrangement, more common in the UK, in which contractors are not guaranteed any specific number of work hours nor are they necessarily required to accept all hours offered. <strong>Zero-time </strong>academic appointments, also known as 0% appointments, are most often used to provide affiliation to scholars or other kinds of people who are employed in other departments or by other organisations. For example, an economist might be tenured faculty at a business school but also have a zero-time appointment in the economics department of the arts faculty of the same school. This person might advise students or otherwise participate in research and service in both departments, but it is understood that the work in their 0% appointment is covered by the pay from their full-time appointment. Other kinds of people&#8211;artists in residence, politicians, captains of industry&#8211;also get zero-time appointments at universities, often so the universities can use their star power to burnish their credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Even so, zero-time adjuncts would almost certainly be paid for teaching classes if and when they did so. Not to do so would probably be illegal, right?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, here is the crux of the issue. First off, although you can probably read my criticism as implying that zero-time adjuncts would be <em>teaching </em>for free, what I actually said was that they would be <em>working</em> for free. In fact all of the kinds of academic labour I mentioned in yesterday&#8217;s post were duties professors undertake <em>in addition to teaching</em>. Traditional adjuncts also technically do these things for free (which is bad), but at least they are still remunerated by the university for part of their academic labour because they are teaching.</p>
<p>So what does it mean when they also don&#8217;t get teaching?</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously believe that they will be compensated at a specific and fair hourly rate for time they spend at departmental meetings, on thesis committees, advising and communicating with students, collaborating on research projects, or having other &#8220;intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units&#8221;? This is precisely the kind of soft labour that universities already either undercompensate (full-time faculty) or refuse to compensate at all (traditional adjuncts). Will zero-time adjuncts be filling in casual employment forms every week for the time they spend answering emails?</p>
<p>Like it or not, &#8220;professor&#8221; is still a word with a meaning. Most people&#8211;I dare say the vast majority of people&#8211;think that it means someone who teaches at a university. Even most students don&#8217;t <em>really</em> understand the difference between full-time and contingent faculty, because they don&#8217;t have much first-hand experience with the non-teaching work that professors do. Or when they do (e.g. academic advising, mentorship, etc.), they don&#8217;t appreciate that it is a separate activity that is supposed to be remunerated separately. That&#8217;s exactly why I wrote my <a href="http://schoolofdoubt.com/2016/02/03/syllabus-adjunct-clause/">Syllabus Adjunct Clause</a>, which presumably went viral for a reason.</p>
<p>This lack of awareness is why it is so dangerous to allow this precedent. Adjunct &#8220;professors&#8221; recruited at zero-time to replace unrenewed contract teachers would look just like normal faculty to most outsiders and even to students&#8211;they&#8217;d be listed right there on the department website along with everyone else. The university gets to appear as if it has adequate academic staffing and benefit from adjuncts&#8217; soft labour and research affiliation without having to actually pay anyone for their trouble. If SIU can&#8217;t afford to pay faculty because of a budget crisis,* then it should suffer the consequences of not having adequate faculty until either the funding situation is remedied by the state or they shut their doors for failure to serve their mission. But to pretend it&#8217;s business as usual on the backs of vulnerable new PhDs is unconscionable.</p>
<p>*I will leave it up to the reader to decide how serious a budget crisis it must be if the top dozen SIU administrators all earn in excess of $200k per year and well over 200 employees&#8211;I stopped counting&#8211;earn in excess of $100k (rent must be steep in rural Southern Illinois).</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Chairs,</p>
<p>I know you are swamped right now with various requests and annual duties. I apologize for adding to that, but I am here to advocate for something that merits your attention. The Alumni Association has initiated a pilot program involving the College of Science, College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences and Arts,<em><strong> seeking qualified alumni to join the SIU Graduate Faculty in a zero-time (adjunct) status.</strong></em></p>
<p>Candidates for appointment must meet HLC accreditation guidelines for appointment as adjunct professors, and they will generally hold an academic doctorate or other terminal degree as appropriate for the field.</p>
<p><em><strong>These blanket zero-time adjunct graduate faculty appointments are for 3-year periods, and can be renewed. While specific duties of alumni adjuncts will likely vary across academic units, examples include service on graduate student thesis committees, teaching specific graduate or undergraduate lectures in one’s area of expertise, service on departmental or university committees, and collaborations on grant proposals and research projects.</strong></em> Moreover, participating alumni can benefit from intellectual interactions with faculty in their respective units, as well as through collegial networking opportunities with other alumni adjuncts who will come together regularly (either in-person or via the web) to discuss best practices across campus.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association is already working to identify prospective candidates, but it <em><strong>asks for your help in nominating some of your finest former students who are passionate about supporting SIU</strong></em>. Please reach out to your faculty to see if they might nominate a former student who would meet HLC accreditation guidelines for adjunct faculty appointment, which is someone holding a Ph.D., MFA, or other terminal degree. One of the short-comings with our current approach to the doctoral alumni is that the database only includes those with a Ph.D. earned at SIU, but often doesn’t capture SIU graduates with earned doctorates from other institutions. Here are the recommended steps to follow:</p>
<p>· Chairs in collaboration with faculty should consider specific needs/desires of their particular department, and ask how they could best utilize adjunct faculty. For example, many departments are always looking for additional highly qualified members to serve on thesis committees, and to provide individual lectures, seminars, and mentorship activities for both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>
<p>· Based on faculty recommendations, chairs should identify a few good candidates and approach those individuals to see if they are interested. The interested candidate should provide his/her CV (along with a brief letter of interest outlining areas in which they are willing to participate) to the department chair, who can then approach the Graduate Dean for final vetting and approval.</p>
<p>The University hasn’t yet attempted its first alumni adjunct appointment, but this is the general mechanism already in place. Meera would like CoLA to establish a critical mass of nominees before the end of the summer. A goal of at least one (1) nominee per department would get us going.</p>

<p>In case you don&#8217;t speak adminstratese, &#8220;zero-time&#8221; means &#8220;unpaid.&#8221; Molino has set up an official, university-wide programme encouraging <em>every single department</em> to exploit the precarious labour market for their own graduates by offering them continued status and institutional affiliation in return for working for free.</p>
<p>For those of you outside academia this might seem like such a self-evidently bad deal that you would wonder why on earth anyone would take it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s exactly the problem: things are already <em>so bad</em> in the academic labour market that adjuncting for free for a few years at your alma mater isn&#8217;t even all that much worse than what many new PhDs are already doing, not to mention the fact that academics spend their formative years immersed in a professional culture that not only encourages but <em>demands</em> uncompensated labour (mentoring, research, conferences, publication, peer review) as &#8220;service to the discipline&#8221; and proof of professional dedication.</p>
<p>At one time this demand was not unreasonable, grounded as it was in a strong social contract whereby full time tenured and tenure-track faculty were compensated for this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by their home institutions rather than by the academic publishers, conferences, and research projects who were the direct beneficiaries of their research and service labour. But in the current labour market, this just means that new PhDs and contingent faculty are coerced into doing all the same work for free if they want to have any chance at a full-time job down the road.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like institutional status and even plain old library privileges are crucial to many new PhDs&#8217; ability even to work for free: most granting agencies require some kind of institutional affiliation from their applicants and subscriptions to academic journals and other resources are ruinously expensive to independent researchers outside traditional institutional settings.</p>
<p>And when many adjuncts already don&#8217;t earn anything close to a living wage, <em>is</em> there even much difference between that and nothing at all? In the end, it&#8217;s just a few more deliveries for Uber Eats.</p>

            <div class="panel-body"><p>Dear [STUDENT],</p>
<p>Thank you for writing me with your question about [COURSE]. I am currently out of the office because I am contingent faculty and do not have an office.</p>
<p>This automated response email is intended to help you find the answer to your question on your own, as my average hourly pay for teaching this course has already fallen well below minimum wage and I cannot answer emails while driving for Uber.</p>
<p>The following questionnaire is designed to help you determine the right place to look for the answer to your question. Please go through it in order until you find the answer to your query. IF and ONLY IF you go through the entire list without finding the answer to your question, please follow the instructions at the end as to where to send your question in order to receive an answer directly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin, shall we?</p>
<p>1. Am I your professor, and are you currently enrolled in my class?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If the answer is NO, please consult your course schedule online to determine which professor you are supposed to be bothering with your inane question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you have questions about enrollment and registration, please contact the Office of the Registrar, where they receive both fair hourly pay and full benefits in compensation for helping you solve your problems.</p>
<p>2. Is the answer to your question on the course syllabus, which we went over in detail on the first day of class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Questions answered on the syllabus include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When and where does our class meet?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">What assignments do we have and when are they due?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When are exams and what will be on them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How many points are deducted from our final grade when we email you questions that are clearly answered on the syllabus?</p>
<p>3. If your question is about a specific assignment, is it answered on the assignment sheet, which we went over in detail in class and which is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">If you do not understand specific terminology used on the assignment sheet, please try consulting your textbook&#8217;s glossary, a dictionary, or Google. You may also want to try coming to class, where I teach you what these words mean.</p>
<p>4. Is your question answered on our course FAQ page, which currently lists 127 commonly asked questions and is freely available online 24 hours a day from anywhere in the world?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You may find it easier to use Ctrl+F and search for specific keywords to navigate this very long document.</p>
<p>5. Is your question unrelated to our class, inappropriate, or just plain unanswerable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Such questions might include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">How much wood a woodchuck can chuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The sound of one hand clapping, trees falling in the woods, or other Zen koans (try <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=XB-ICwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">this book</a> instead)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Whether or not Bernie would have won</p>
<p>6. If you have reached the end of this questionnaire without finding the answer you need, you probably have a valid question. Congratulations!</p>
